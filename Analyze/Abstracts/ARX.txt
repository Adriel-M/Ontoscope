BACKGROUND: Previous findings showed a tendency toward higher gait variability in
children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to
controls. This study examined whether gait variability in children with ADHD
eventually approaches normality with increasing age (delay hypothesis) or whether
these gait alterations represent a persistent deviation from typical development 
(deviation hypothesis).
METHOD: This cross-sectional study compared 30 children with ADHD (25 boys;
Mage=10 years 11 months, range 8-13 years; n=21 off medication, n=9 without
medication) to 28 controls (25 boys; Mage=10 years 10 months, range 8-13 years). 
Gait parameters (i.e. velocity and variability in stride length and stride time) 
were assessed using an electronic walkway system (GAITRite) while children walked
at their own pace.
RESULTS: Children with ADHD walked with significantly higher variability in
stride time compared to controls. Age was negatively associated with gait
variability in children with ADHD such that children with higher age walked with 
lower variability, whereas in controls there was no such association.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with ADHD displayed a less regular gait pattern than
controls, indicated by their higher variability in stride time. The age-dependent
decrease of gait variability in children with ADHD showed that gait performance
became more regular with age and converged toward that of typically developing
children. These results may reflect a maturational delay rather than a persistent
deviation of gait regularity among children with ADHD compared to typically
developing children.

OBJECTIVE: Although glucagon-secreting a-cells and insulin-secreting ß-cells have
opposing functions in regulating plasma glucose levels, the two cell types share 
a common developmental origin and exhibit overlapping transcriptomes and
epigenomes. Notably, destruction of ß-cells can stimulate repopulation via
transdifferentiation of a-cells, at least in mice, suggesting plasticity between 
these cell fates. Furthermore, dysfunction of both a- and ß-cells contributes to 
the pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and ß-cell de-differentiation 
has been proposed to contribute to type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to
delineate the molecular properties that maintain islet cell type specification
yet allow for cellular plasticity. We hypothesized that correlating cell
type-specific transcriptomes with an atlas of open chromatin will identify novel 
genes and transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers involved in a-
and ß-cell specification and plasticity.
METHODS: We sorted human a- and ß-cells and performed the "Assay for
Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing" (ATAC-seq) and 
mRNA-seq, followed by integrative analysis to identify cell type-selective gene
regulatory regions.
RESULTS: We identified numerous transcripts with either a-cell- or
ß-cell-selective expression and discovered the cell type-selective open chromatin
regions that correlate with these gene activation patterns. We confirmed cell
type-selective expression on the protein level for two of the top hits from our
screen. The "group specific protein" (GC; or vitamin D binding protein) was
restricted to a-cells, while CHODL (chondrolectin) immunoreactivity was only
present in ß-cells. Furthermore, a-cell- and ß-cell-selective ATAC-seq peaks were
identified to overlap with known binding sites for islet transcription factors,
as well as with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified as
risk loci for type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: We have determined the genetic landscape of human a- and ß-cells
based on chromatin accessibility and transcript levels, which allowed for
detection of novel a- and ß-cell signature genes not previously known to be
expressed in islets. Using fine-mapping of open chromatin, we have identified
thousands of potential cis-regulatory elements that operate in an endocrine cell 
type-specific fashion.

Altered expression of developmental regulators of parvalbumin and somatostatin
neurons in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.

Dysfunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory neurons that express the
calcium-binding protein parvalbumin or the neuropeptide somatostatin in
schizophrenia may be related to disturbances in the migration, phenotypic
specification, and/or maturation of these neurons. These pre- and postnatal
developmental stages are regulated in a cell type-specific manner by various
transcription factors and co-activators, fibroblast growth factor receptors
(FgfR), and other molecular markers. Consequently, we used quantitative PCR to
quantify mRNA levels for these developmental regulators in the PFC of 62
schizophrenia subjects in whom parvalbumin and somatostatin neuron disturbances
were previously reported, and in antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. Relative to
unaffected comparison subjects, subjects with schizophrenia exhibited elevated
mRNA levels for 1) the transcription factor MafB, which is expressed by
parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons as they migrate from the medial ganglionic
eminence to the cortex, 2) the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1a, which is
expressed postnatally by parvalbumin neurons to maintain parvalbumin levels and
inhibitory function, and 3) FgfR1, which is required for the migration and
phenotypic specification of parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons. Elevations in
these markers were most prominent in younger schizophrenia subjects and were not 
present in antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. Finally, expression levels of other
important developmental regulators (i.e. Dlx1, Dlx5, Dlx6, SATB1, Sip1/Zeb2,
ST8SIA4, cMaf, Nkx6.2, and Arx) were not altered in schizophrenia. The
over-expression of a subset of molecular markers with distinct roles in the pre- 
and postnatal development of parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons might reflect
compensatory mechanisms to sustain the development of these neurons in the face
of other insults.

BACKGROUND: Intellectual Disability (ID) is characterized by deficits in
intellectual functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract
thinking, judgment, and learning. As new avenues are emerging for treatment of
genetically determined ID (such as Down's syndrome or Fragile X syndrome), it is 
necessary to identify objective reliable and sensitive outcome measures for use
in clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: We developed a novel visual analogical reasoning paradigm, inspired by
the Progressive Raven's Matrices, but appropriate for Intellectually Disabled
patients. This new paradigm assesses reasoning and inhibition abilities in ID
patients.
METHODS: We performed behavioural analyses for this task (with a reaction time
and error rate analysis, Study 1) in 96 healthy controls (adults and typically
developed children older than 4) and 41 genetically determined ID patients
(Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome and ARX mutated patients). In order to
establish and quantify the cognitive strategies used to solve the task, we also
performed an eye-tracking analysis (Study 2).
RESULTS: Down syndrome, ARX and Fragile X patients were significantly slower and 
made significantly more errors than chronological age-matched healthy controls.
The effect of inhibition on error rate was greater than the matrix complexity
effect in ID patients, opposite to findings in adult healthy controls.
Interestingly, ID patients were more impaired by inhibition than mental
age-matched healthy controls, but not by the matrix complexity. Eye-tracking
analysis made it possible to identify the strategy used by the participants to
solve the task. Adult healthy controls used a matrix-based strategy, whereas ID
patients used a response-based strategy. Furthermore, etiologic-specific
reasoning differences were evidenced between ID patients groups.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that this paradigm, appropriate for ID patients and
developmental populations as well as adult healthy controls, provides an
objective and quantitative assessment of visual analogical reasoning and
cognitive inhibition, enabling testing for the effect of pharmacological or
behavioural intervention in these specific populations.

Redifferentiation of expanded human islet ß cells by inhibition of ARX.

Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

Ex-vivo expansion of adult human islet ß cells has been evaluated for generation 
of abundant insulin-producing cells for transplantation; however, lineage-tracing
has demonstrated that this process results in ß-cell dedifferentiation.
Redifferentiation of ß-cell-derived (BCD) cells can be achieved using a
combination of soluble factors termed Redifferentiation Cocktail (RC); however,
this treatment leads to redifferentiation of only a fraction of BCD cells. This
study aimed at improving redifferentiation efficiency by affecting the balance of
islet progenitor-cell transcription factors activated by RC treatment.
Specifically, RC treatment induces the transcription factors PAX4 and ARX, which 
play key roles in directing pancreas endocrine progenitor cells into the ß/d or
a/PP developmental pathways, respectively. Misactivation of ARX in RC-treated BCD
cells may inhibit their redifferentiation into ß cells. Blocking ARX expression
by shRNA elevated insulin mRNA levels 12.8-fold, and more than doubled the number
of insulin-positive BCD cells. ARX inhibition in expanded a-cell-derived cells
treated with RC did not cause their transdifferentiation into insulin-producing
cells. The combination of RC and ARX shRNA treatment may facilitate the
generation of abundant insulin-producing cells for transplantation into patients 
with type 1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) displays
temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), in which incubation temperature
during embryonic development determines the sexual fate of the individual.
However, the molecular mechanisms governing this process remain a mystery,
including the influence of initial environmental temperature on the comprehensive
gonadal gene expression patterns occurring during TSD.
RESULTS: Our characterization of transcriptomes during alligator TSD allowed us
to identify novel candidate genes involved in TSD initiation. High-throughput RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on gonads collected from A. mississippiensis
embryos incubated at both a male and a female producing temperature (33.5 °C and 
30 °C, respectively) in a time series during sexual development. RNA-seq yielded 
375.2 million paired-end reads, which were mapped and assembled, and used to
characterize differential gene expression. Changes in the transcriptome occurring
as a function of both development and sexual differentiation were extensively
profiled. Forty-one differentially expressed genes were detected in response to
incubation at male producing temperature, and included genes such as Wnt
signaling factor WNT11, histone demethylase KDM6B, and transcription factor
C/EBPA. Furthermore, comparative analysis of development- and sex-dependent
differential gene expression revealed 230 candidate genes involved in alligator
sex determination and differentiation, and early details of the suspected
male-fate commitment were profiled. We also discovered sexually dimorphic
expression of uncharacterized ncRNAs and other novel elements, such as unique
expression patterns of HEMGN and ARX. Twenty-five of the differentially expressed
genes identified in our analysis were putative transcriptional regulators, among 
which were MYBL2, MYCL, and HOXC10, in addition to conventional sex
differentiation genes such as SOX9, and FOXL2. Inferred gene regulatory network
was constructed, and the gene-gene and temperature-gene interactions were
predicted.
CONCLUSIONS: Gonadal global gene expression kinetics during sex determination has
been extensively profiled for the first time in a TSD species. These findings
provide insights into the genetic framework underlying TSD, and expand our
current understanding of the developmental fate pathways during vertebrate sex
determination.

The 2 most abundant human pancreatic islet cell types are insulin-producing
ß-cells and glucagon-producing a-cells. Defined cis-regulatory elements from
rodent Insulin genes have permitted genetic labeling of human islet ß-cells,
enabling lineage tracing and generation of human ß-cell lines, but analogous
elements for genetically labeling human a-cells with high specificity do not yet 
exist. To identify genetic elements that specifically direct reporter expression 
to human a-cells, we investigated noncoding sequences adjacent to the human
GLUCAGON and ARX genes, which are expressed in islet a-cells. Elements with high 
evolutionary conservation were cloned into lentiviral vectors to direct
fluorescent reporter expression in primary human islets. Based on the specificity
of reporter expression for a- and ß-cells, we found that rat glucagon promoter
was not specific for human a-cells but that addition of human GLUCAGON
untranslated region sequences substantially enhanced specificity of labeling in
both cultured and transplanted islets to a degree not previously reported, to our
knowledge. Specific transgene expression from these cis-regulatory sequences in
human a-cells should enable targeted genetic modification and lineage tracing.

Single-Trial Extraction of Pure Somatosensory Evoked Potential Based on
Expectation Maximization Approach.

Chen W, Chang C, Hu Y.

It is of great importance for intraoperative monitoring to accurately extract
somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and track its changes fast. Currently,
multi-trial averaging is widely adopted for SEP signal extraction. However,
because of the loss of variations related to SEP features across different
trials, the estimated SEPs in such a way are not suitable for the purpose of
real-time monitoring of every single trial of SEP. In order to handle this issue,
a number of single-trial SEP extraction approaches have been developed in the
literature, such as ARX and SOBI, but most of them have their performance limited
due to not sufficient utilization of multi-trial and multi-condition structures
of the signals. In this paper, a novel Bayesian model of SEP signals is proposed 
to make systemic use of multi-trial and multi-condition priors and other
structural information in the signal by integrating both a cortical source
propagation model and a SEP basis components model, and an Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for single-trial SEP estimation under
this model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the developed method can
provide reasonably good single-trial estimations of SEP as long as
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurements is no worse than -25 dB. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is further verified by its application to
real SEP measurements of a number of different subjects during spinal surgeries. 
It is observed that using the proposed approach the main SEP features (i.e.,
latencies) can be reliably estimated at single-trial basis, and thus the
variation of latencies in different trials can be traced, which provides a solid 
support for surgical intraoperative monitoring.

Identification of dynamical biological systems based on random effects models.

Batista L, Bastogne T, Djermoune el-H.

System identification is a data-driven modeling approach more and more used in
biology and biomedicine. In this application context, each assay is always
repeated to estimate the response variability. The inference of the modeling
conclusions to the whole population requires to account for the inter-individual 
variability within the modeling procedure. One solution consists in using random 
effects models but up to now no similar approach exists in the field of dynamical
system identification. In this article, we propose a new solution based on an ARX
(Auto Regressive model with eXternal inputs) structure using the EM
(Expectation-Maximisation) algorithm for the estimation of the model parameters. 
Simulations show the relevance of this solution compared with a classical
procedure of system identification repeated for each subject.

Glucagon and a-cell dysfunction are critical in the development of hyperglycemia 
during diabetes both in humans and rodents. We hypothesized that a-cell
dysfunction leading to dysregulated glucagon secretion in diabetes is due to both
a lack of insulin and intrinsic defects. To characterize a-cell dysfunction in
diabetes, we used glucagon-Venus transgenic male mice and induced insulinopenic
hyperglycemia by streptozotocin administration leading to alterations of glucagon
secretion. We investigated the in vivo impact of insulinopenic hyperglycemia on
glucagon-producing cells using FACS-sorted a-cells from control and diabetic
mice. We demonstrate that increased glucagonemia in diabetic mice is mainly due
to increases of glucagon release and biosynthesis per cell compared with controls
without changes in a-cell mass. We identified genes coding for proteins involved 
in glucagon biosynthesis and secretion, a-cell differentiation, and potential
stress markers such as the glucagon, Arx, MafB, cMaf, Brain4, Foxa1, Foxa3,
HNF4a, TCF7L2, Glut1, Sglt2, Cav2.1, Cav2.2, Nav1.7, Kir6.2/Sur1, Pten, IR,
NeuroD1, GPR40, and Sumo1 genes, which were abnormally regulated in diabetic
mice. Importantly, insulin treatment partially corrected a-cell function and
expression of genes coding for proglucagon, or involved in glucagon secretion,
glucose transport and insulin signaling but not those coding for cMAF, FOXA1, and
a-cell differentiation markers as well as GPR40, NEUROD1, CAV2.1, and SUMO1. Our 
results indicate that insulinopenic diabetes induce marked a-cell dysfunction and
molecular alteration, which are only partially corrected by in vivo insulin
treatment.

A Variational Bayesian Approach to Robust Identification of Switched ARX Models.

Lu Y, Huang B, Khatibisepehr S.

A variational Bayesian approach to robust identification of switched
auto-regressive exogenous models is developed in this paper. By formulating the
problem of interest under a full Bayesian identification framework, the number of
local-models can be determined automatically, while accounting for the
uncertainty of parameter estimates in the overall identification procedure. A set
of significance coefficients is used to assign proper importance weights to
local-models. By maximizing the marginal likelihood of the identification data,
insignificant local-models will be suppressed and the optimal number of
local-models can be determined. Considering the fact that the identification data
may be contaminated with outliers, t distributions with adjustable tails are
utilized to model the contaminating noise so that the proposed identification
algorithm is robust. The effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian approach is
demonstrated through a simulated example as well as a detailed industrial
application.

The in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offers a model
system to explore human development. Humans with mutations in the transcription
factor Aristaless Related Homeobox (ARX) often suffer from the syndrome X-linked 
lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (XLAG), affecting many cell types
including those of the pancreas. Indeed, XLAG pancreatic islets lack glucagon and
pancreatic polypeptide-positive cells but retain somatostatin, insulin, and
ghrelin-positive cells. To further examine the role of ARX in human pancreatic
endocrine development, we utilized genomic editing in hESCs to generate deletions
in ARX. ARX knockout hESCs retained pancreatic differentiation capacity and ARX
knockout endocrine cells were biased toward somatostatin-positive cells (94% of
endocrine cells) with reduced pancreatic polypeptide (rarely detected), glucagon 
(90% reduced) and insulin-positive (65% reduced) lineages. ARX knockout
somatostatin-positive cells shared expression patterns with human fetal and adult
d-cells. Differentiated ARX knockout cells upregulated PAX4, NKX2.2, ISL1, HHEX, 
PCSK1, PCSK2 expression while downregulating PAX6 and IRX2. Re-expression of ARX 
in ARX knockout pancreatic progenitors reduced HHEX and increased PAX6 and
insulin expression following differentiation. Taken together these data suggest
that ARX plays a key role in pancreatic endocrine fate specification of
pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, glucagon and insulin positive cells from
hESCs.

Polyglutamine (polyGln) expansions in nine human proteins result in neurological 
diseases and induce the proteins' tendency to form ß-rich amyloid fibrils and
intracellular deposits. Less well known are at least nine other human diseases
caused by polyalanine (polyAla)-expansion mutations in different proteins. The
mechanisms of how polyAla aggregates under physiological conditions remain
unclear and controversial. We show here that aggregation of polyAla is
mechanistically dissimilar to that of polyGln and hence does not exhibit amyloid 
kinetics. PolyAla assembled spontaneously into a-helical clusters with diverse
oligomeric states. Such clustering was pervasive in cells irrespective of visible
aggregate formation, and it disrupted the normal physiological oligomeric state
of two human proteins natively containing polyAla: ARX and SOX3. This
self-assembly pattern indicates that polyAla expansions chronically disrupt
protein behavior by imposing a deranged oligomeric status.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Indiana University , 800 E. Kirkwood Ave,
Bloomington, Indiana 47405.

A method for the catalytic enantioselective diarylation of alkenes is presented. 
The method allowed for the synthesis of highly enantioenriched
2,3-dihydrobenzofurans and indolines containing molecules from readily available 
substrates. Furthermore, this method allowed for the enantioselective synthesis
of quaternary carbons. Based on mechanism studies, the process likely functions
by enantioselective insertion of an alkene into an Ar-CuBenzP* complex to
generate a Csp(3)-Cu complex. Capture of this intermediate with an ArX led to
formation of the desired product.

The mechanism of Stille reactions (cross-coupling of ArX with Ar'SnnBu3 )
performed in the presence of fluoride ions is established. A triple role for
fluoride ions is identified from kinetic data on the rate of the reactions of
trans-[ArPdBr(PPh3 )2 ] (Ar=Ph, p-(CN)C6 H4 ) with Ar'SnBu3 (Ar'=2-thiophenyl) in
the presence of fluoride ions. Fluoride ions promote the rate-determining
transmetallation by formation of trans-[ArPdF(PPh3 )2 ], which reacts with
Ar'SnBu3 (Ar'=Ph, 2-thiophenyl) at room temperature, in contrast to
trans-[ArPdBr(PPh3 )2 ], which is unreactive. However, the concentration ratio
[F(-) ]/[Ar'SnBu3 ] must not be too high, because of the formation of unreactive 
anionic stannate [Ar'Sn(F)Bu3 ](-) . This rationalises the two kinetically
antagonistic roles exerted by the fluoride ions that are observed experimentally,
and is found to be in agreement with the kinetic law. In addition, fluoride ions 
promote reductive elimination from trans-[ArPdAr'(PPh3 )2 ] generated in the
transmetallation step.

The advancements in the field of gerontology have unraveled the signaling
pathways that regulate life span, suggesting that it might be feasible to
modulate aging. To this end, we isolated a novel phytomolecule Acacetin
7-O-a-l-rhamnopyranosyl (1-2) ß-D-xylopyranoside (ARX) from Premna integrifolia
and evaluated its antiaging effects in Caenorhabditis elegans. The spectral data 
analysis revealed the occurrence of a new compound ARX. Out of the three tested
pharmacological doses of ARX, viz. 5, 25, and 50 µM, the 25-µM dose was able to
extend life span in C. elegans by more than 39%. The present study suggests that 
ARX affects bacterial metabolism, which in turn leads to dietary restriction
(DR)-like effects in the worms. The effect of ARX on worms with mutations (mev-1,
eat-2, sir-2.1, skn-1, daf-16, and hsf-1) indicates that ARX-mediated life-span
extension involves mechanisms associated with DR and maintenance of cellular
redox homeostasis. This study is the first time report on longevity-promoting
activity of ARX in C. elegans mediated by stress and DR-regulating genes. This
novel phytomolecule can contribute in designing therapeutics for managing aging
and age-related diseases.

The cost of quality: Implementing generalization and suppression for anonymizing 
biomedical data with minimal information loss.

OBJECTIVE: With the ARX data anonymization tool structured biomedical data can be
de-identified using syntactic privacy models, such as k-anonymity. Data is
transformed with two methods: (a) generalization of attribute values, followed by
(b) suppression of data records. The former method results in data that is well
suited for analyses by epidemiologists, while the latter method significantly
reduces loss of information. Our tool uses an optimal anonymization algorithm
that maximizes output utility according to a given measure. To achieve
scalability, existing optimal anonymization algorithms exclude parts of the
search space by predicting the outcome of data transformations regarding privacy 
and utility without explicitly applying them to the input dataset. These
optimizations cannot be used if data is transformed with generalization and
suppression. As optimal data utility and scalability are important for
anonymizing biomedical data, we had to develop a novel method.
METHODS: In this article, we first confirm experimentally that combining
generalization with suppression significantly increases data utility. Next, we
proof that, within this coding model, the outcome of data transformations
regarding privacy and utility cannot be predicted. As a consequence, existing
algorithms fail to deliver optimal data utility. We confirm this finding
experimentally. The limitation of previous work can be overcome at the cost of
increased computational complexity. However, scalability is important for
anonymizing data with user feedback. Consequently, we identify properties of
datasets that may be predicted in our context and propose a novel and efficient
algorithm. Finally, we evaluate our solution with multiple datasets and privacy
models.
RESULTS: This work presents the first thorough investigation of which properties 
of datasets can be predicted when data is anonymized with generalization and
suppression. Our novel approach adopts existing optimization strategies to our
context and combines different search methods. The experiments show that our
method is able to efficiently solve a broad spectrum of anonymization problems.
CONCLUSION: Our work shows that implementing syntactic privacy models is
challenging and that existing algorithms are not well suited for anonymizing data
with transformation models which are more complex than generalization alone. As
such models have been recommended for use in the biomedical domain, our results
are of general relevance for de-identifying structured biomedical data.

AIM: Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) syndrome is a developmental encephalopathy
characterized by postnatal microcephaly, structural brain abnormalities, facial
dysmorphisms, severe delay with absent language, defective social interactions,
and epilepsy. Abnormal movements in FOXG1 syndrome have often been mentioned but 
not characterized.
METHOD: We clinically assessed and analysed video recordings of eight patients
with different mutations or copy number variations affecting the FOXG1 gene and
describe the peculiar pattern of the associated movement disorder.
RESULTS: The age of the patients in the study ranged from 2 to 17 years old (six 
females, two males). They had severe epilepsy and exhibited a complex motor
disorder including various combinations of dyskinetic and hyperkinetic movements 
featuring dystonia, chorea, and athetosis. The onset of the movement disorder was
apparent within the first year of life, reached its maximum expression within
months, and then remained stable.
INTERPRETATION: A hyperkinetic-dyskinetic movement disorder emerges as a
distinctive feature of the FOXG1-related phenotype. FOXG1 syndrome is as an
epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy whose clinical presentation bears
similarities with ARX- and STXBP1-gene related encephalopathies.

Protein-coding mutations in the transcription factor-encoding gene ARX cause
various forms of intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. In contrast,
variations in surrounding non-coding sequences are correlated with milder forms
of non-syndromic ID and autism and had suggested the importance of ARX gene
regulation in the etiology of these disorders. We compile data on several novel
and some already identified patients with or without ID that carry duplications
of ARX genomic region and consider likely genetic mechanisms underlying the
neurodevelopmental defects. We establish the long-range regulatory domain of ARX 
and identify its brain region-specific autoregulation. We conclude that
neurodevelopmental disturbances in the patients may not simply arise from
increased dosage due to ARX duplication. This is further exemplified by a small
duplication involving a non-functional ARX copy, but with duplicated enhancers.
ARX enhancers are located within a 504-kb region and regulate expression
specifically in the forebrain in developing and adult zebrafish. Transgenic
enhancer-reporter lines were used as in vivo tools to delineate a brain
region-specific negative and positive autoregulation of ARX. We find
autorepression of ARX in the telencephalon and autoactivation in the ventral
thalamus. Fluorescently labeled brain regions in the transgenic lines facilitated
the identification of neuronal outgrowth and pathfinding disturbances in the
ventral thalamus and telencephalon that occur when arxa dosage is diminished. In 
summary, we have established a model for how breakpoints in long-range gene
regulation alter the expression levels of a target gene brain
region-specifically, and how this can cause subtle neuronal phenotypes relating
to the etiology of associated neuropsychiatric disease.

The embryonic development of the pancreas is orchestrated by a complex and
coordinated transcription factor network. Neurogenin3 (Neurog3) initiates the
endocrine program by activating the expression of additional transcription
factors driving survival, proliferation, maturation and lineage allocation of
endocrine precursors. Among the direct targets of Neurog3, Pax4 appears as one of
the key regulators of ß-cell specification. Indeed, mice lacking Pax4 die a few
days postpartum, as they develop severe hyperglycemia due to the absence of
mature pancreatic ß-cells. Pax4 also directly regulates the expression of Arx, a 
gene that plays a crucial role in a-cell specification. Comparative analysis of
Pax4 and Arx mutants, as well as Arx/Pax4 double mutants, showed that islet
subtype destiny is mainly directed by cross-repression of the Pax4 and Arx
factors. Importantly, the ectopic expression of Pax4 in a-cells was found
sufficient to induce their neogenesis and conversion into ß-like cells, not only 
during development but also in adult rodents. Therefore, differentiated endocrine
a-cells can be considered as a putative source for insulin-producing ß-like
cells. These findings have clearly widened our understanding regarding pancreatic
development, but they also open new research avenues in the context of diabetes
research.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) lead to a range of
X-linked intellectual disability phenotypes, with truncating variants generally
resulting in severe X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (XLAG), and
polyalanine expansions and missense variants resulting in infantile spasms. We
report two male patients with early-onset infantile spasms in whom a novel
c.34G>T (p.(E12*)) variant was identified in the ARX gene. A similar variant
c.81C>G (p.(Y27*)), has previously been described in two affected cousins with
early-onset infantile spasms, leading to reinitiation of ARX mRNA translation
resulting in an N-terminal truncated protein. We show that the novel c.34G>T
(p.(E12*)) variant also reinitiated mRNA translation at the next AUG codon
(c.121-123 (p.M41)), producing the same N-terminally truncated protein. The
production of both of these truncated proteins was demonstrated to be at markedly
reduced levels using in vitro cell assays. Using luciferase reporter assays, we
demonstrate that transcriptional repression capacity of ARX was diminished by
both the loss of the N-terminal corepressor octapeptide domain, as a consequence 
of truncation, and the marked reduction in mutant protein expression. Our study
indicates that premature termination mutations very early in ARX lead to
reinitiation of translation to produce N-terminally truncated protein at markedly
reduced levels of expression. We conclude that even low levels of N-terminally
truncated ARX is sufficient to improve the patient's phenotype compared with the 
severe phenotype of XLAG that includes malformations of the brain and genitalia
normally seen in complete loss-of-function mutations in ARX.European Journal of

Epileptic encephalopathies are characterized by recurrent clinical seizures and
prominent interictal epileptiform discharges seen during the early infantile
period. Although epileptic encephalopathies are mostly associated with structural
brain defects and inherited metabolic disorders, pathogenic gene mutations may
also be involved in the development of epileptic encephalopathies even when no
clear genetic inheritance patterns or consanguinity exist. The most common
epileptic encephalopathies are Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy,
epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, West syndrome and Dravet
syndrome, which are usually unresponsive to traditional antiepileptic medication.
Many of the diagnoses describe the phenotype of these electroclinical syndromes, 
but not the underlying causes. To date, approximately 265 genes have been defined
in epilepsy and several genes including STXBP1, ARX, SLC25A22, KCNQ2, CDKL5,
SCN1A, and PCDH19 have been found to be associated with early-onset epileptic
encephalopathies. In this review, we aimed to present a diagnostic approach to
primary genetic causes of early-onset epileptic encephalopathies.

Infantile spasms syndrome (ISs) is characterized by clinical spasms with ictal
electrodecrement, usually occurring before the age of 1 year and frequently
associated with cognitive impairment. Etiology is widely heterogeneous, the cause
remaining elusive in 40% of patients. We searched for de novo mutations in 10
probands with ISs and their parents using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Patients 
had neither consanguinity nor family history of epilepsy. Common causes of ISs
were excluded by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), metabolic screening,
array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and testing for mutations in CDKL5,
STXBP1, and for ARX duplications. We found a probably pathogenic mutation in four
patients. Missense mutations in SCN2A (p.Leu1342Pro) and KCNQ2 (p.Ala306Thr) were
found in two patients with no history of epilepsy before the onset of ISs. The
p.Asn107Ser missense mutation of ALG13 had been previously reported in four
females with ISs. The fourth mutation was an in-frame deletion (p.Phe110del) in
NR2F1, a gene whose mutations cause intellectual disability, epilepsy, and optic 
atrophy. In addition, we found a possibly pathogenic variant in KIF3C that
encodes a kinesin expressed during neural development. Our results confirm that
WES improves significantly the diagnosis yield in patients with sporadic ISs.

Small differences in the reactivity of weakly nucleophilic potassium

cross-coupling of K[4-RC6F4BF3] (R = H, Bu, MeO, EtO, PrO, iPrO, BuO, t-BuO,

with ArX (4-BrC6H4CH3, 4-IC6H4F and 3-IC6H4F). An assumed role of silver(I)
compounds Ag m Y (Y = O, NO3, SO4, BF4, F) consists in polarization of the Pd-X
bond in neutral complex ArPdL n X with the generation of the related transition
state or formation of [ArPdL n ][XAg m Y] with a highly electrophilic cation and 
subsequent transmetallation with the weakly nucleophilic borate. Efficiency of Ag
m Y as a polarizing agent decreases in order Ag2O > AgNO3  Ag2SO4 > Ag[BF4] >
AgF. No clear correlation between the reactivity of K[4-RC6F4BF3] and substituent
electron parameters, sI and sR°, of the aryl group 4-RC6F4 was found.

Influence of Asian dust storms on daily acute myocardial infarction hospital
admissions.

Taiwan.

OBJECTIVE: This study was the first to explore the relationship between Asian
dust storm events (ADS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospital admissions
by applying time series models.
DESIGN AND SAMPLE: Nationwide population-based hospitalization claims data in
Taiwan were used. There were 143,063 AMI admissions during 2000-2009.
MEASURES: An autoregressive with exogenous variables (ARX) time series model was 
used to investigate the dynamic connection between AMI hospital admissions and
ADS events.
RESULTS: AMI hospitalizations significantly spiked on post-ADS day three. Among
the total population, 3.2 more cases of AMI admissions occurred on post-ADS day
three. When the data were stratified by age and gender, the same delayed effect
was present in the male population, especially those aged 45-64 and over 74.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that although an ADS event does not cause an
immediate incidence of AMI, storms may increase AMI incidence through a delayed
effect. Hence, AMI prevention is not only important during a dust storm, but
particularly so in subsequent days. During the days after an ADS, exposure to
dust should be minimized by staying indoors as much as possible and by wearing a 
mask when exposure to dust is unavoidable. This is especially true for working
and older adults. Nurses at local public health centers can increase awareness
and promote public safety by providing health information to local communities
regarding the link between dust storms and AMI.

Genotype-phenotype correlation in neuronal migration disorders and cortical
dysplasias.

Kato M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine Yamagata,
Japan.

Neuronal migration disorders are human (or animal) diseases that result from a
disruption in the normal movement of neurons from their original birth site to
their final destination during early development. As a consequence, the neurons
remain somewhere along their migratory route, their location depending on the
pathological mechanism and its severity. The neurons form characteristic
abnormalities, which are morphologically classified into several types, such as
lissencephaly, heterotopia, and cobblestone dysplasia. Polymicrogyria is
classified as a group of malformations that appear secondary to post-migration
development; however, recent findings of the underlying molecular mechanisms
reveal overlapping processes in the neuronal migration and post-migration
development stages. Mutations of many genes are involved in neuronal migration
disorders, such as LIS1 and DCX in classical lissencephaly spectrum, TUBA1A in
microlissencephaly with agenesis of the corpus callosum, and RELN and VLDLR in
lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia. ARX is of particular interest from
basic and clinical perspectives because it is critically involved in tangential
migration of GABAergic interneurons in the forebrain and its mutations cause a
variety of phenotypes ranging from hydranencephaly or lissencephaly to
early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, including Ohtahara syndrome and infantile
spasms or intellectual disability with no brain malformations. The recent
advances in gene and genome analysis technologies will enable the genetic basis
of neuronal migration disorders to be unraveled, which, in turn, will facilitate 
genotype-phenotype correlations to be determined.

The Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene is implicated in intellectual
disability with the most frequent pathogenic mutations leading to expansions of
the first two polyalanine tracts. Here, we describe analysis of the ARX gene
outlining the approaches in the Australian and Portuguese setting, using an
integrated clinical and molecular strategy. We report variants in the ARX gene
detected in 19 patients belonging to 17 families. Seven pathogenic variants,
being expansion mutations in both polyalanine tract 1 and tract 2, were
identifyed, including a novel mutation in polyalanine tract 1 that expands the
first tract to 20 alanines. This precise number of alanines is sufficient to
cause pathogenicity when expanded in polyalanine tract 2. Five cases presented a 
probably non-pathogenic variant, including the novel HGVS: c.441_455del,
classified as unlikely disease causing, consistent with reports that suggest that
in frame deletions in polyalanine stretches of ARX rarely cause intellectual
disability. In addition, we identified five cases with a variant of unclear
pathogenic significance. Owing to the inconsistent ARX variants description,
publications were reviewed and ARX variant classifications were standardized and 
detailed unambiguously according to recommendations of the Human Genome Variation
Society. In the absence of a pathognomonic clinical feature, we propose that
molecular analysis of the ARX gene should be included in routine diagnostic
practice in individuals with either nonsyndromic or syndromic intellectual
disability. A definitive diagnosis of ARX-related disorders is crucial for an
adequate clinical follow-up and accurate genetic counseling of at-risk family
members.

We investigated the mechanism of epidemics with the impacts of climate change and
socio-economic fluctuations in the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China (AD
1368-1901). Using long-term and high-quality datasets, this study is the first
quantitative research that verifies the 'climate change <U+2192> economy <U+2192> epidemics'
mechanism in historical China by statistical methods that include correlation
analysis, Granger causality analysis, ARX, and Poisson-ARX modeling. The analysis
provides the evidences that climate change could only fundamentally lead to the
epidemics spread and occurrence, but the depressed economic well-being is the
direct trigger of epidemics spread and occurrence at the national and long term
scale in historical China. Moreover, statistical modeling shows that economic
well-being is more important than population pressure in the mechanism of
epidemics. However, population pressure remains a key element in determining the 
social vulnerability of the epidemics occurrence under climate change. Notably,
the findings not only support adaptation theories but also enhance our confidence
to address climatic shocks if economic buffering capacity can be promoted
steadily. The findings can be a basis for scientists and policymakers in
addressing global and regional environmental changes.

Early onset and infantile epileptic encephalopathies (EIEEs) are usually
associated with medically intractable or difficult to treat epileptic seizures
and prominent cognitive, neurodevelopmental and behavioral consequences. EIEEs
have numerous etiologies that contribute to the inter- and intra-syndromic
phenotypic variability. Etiologies include structural and metabolic or genetic
etiologies although a significant percentage is of unknown cause. The need to
better understand their pathogenic mechanisms and identify better therapies has
driven the development of animal models of EIEEs. Several rodent models of
infantile spasms have emerged that recapitulate various aspects of the disease.
The acute models manifest epileptic spasms after induction and include the NMDA
rat model, the NMDA model with prior prenatal betamethasone or perinatal stress
exposure, and the <U+03B3>-butyrolactone induced spasms in a mouse model of Down
syndrome. The chronic models include the tetrodotoxin rat model, the aristaless
related homeobox X-linked (Arx) mouse models and the multiple-hit rat model of
infantile spasms. We will discuss the main features and findings from these
models on target mechanisms and emerging therapies. Genetic models have also
provided interesting data on the pathogenesis of Dravet syndrome and proposed new
therapies for testing. The genetic associations of many of the EIEEs have also
been tested in rodent models as to their pathogenicity. Finally, several models
have tested the impact of subclinical epileptiform discharges on brain function. 
The impact of these advances in animal modeling for therapy development will be
discussed.

Activins A and B Regulate Fate-Determining Gene Expression in Islet Cell Lines
and Islet Cells From Male Mice.

TGFß superfamily ligands, receptors, and second messengers, including activins A 
and B, have been identified in pancreatic islets and proposed to have important
roles regulating development, proliferation, and function. We previously
demonstrated that Fstl3 (an antagonist of activin activity) null mice have larger
islets with ß-cell hyperplasia and improved glucose tolerance and insulin
sensitivity in the absence of altered ß-cell proliferation. This suggested the
hypothesis that increased activin signaling influences ß-cell expansion by
destabilizing the a-cell phenotype and promoting transdifferentiation to ß-cells.
We tested the first part of this hypothesis by treating a- and ß-cell lines and
sorted mouse islet cells with activin and related ligands. Treatment of the
aTC1-6 a cell line with activins A or B suppressed critical a-cell gene
expression, including Arx, glucagon, and MafB while also enhancing ß-cell gene
expression. In INS-1E ß-cells, activin A treatment induced a significant increase
in Pax4 (a fate determining ß-cell gene) and insulin expression. In sorted
primary islet cells, a-cell gene expression was again suppressed by activin
treatment in a-cells, whereas Pax4 was enhanced in ß-cells. Activin treatment in 
both cell lines and primary cells resulted in phosphorylated mothers against
decapentaplegic-2 phosphorylation. Finally, treatment of aTC1-6 cells with
activins A or B significantly inhibited proliferation. These results support the 
hypothesis that activin signaling destabilized the a-cell phenotype while
promoting a ß-cell fate. Moreover, these results support a model in which the
ß-cell expansion observed in Fstl3 null mice may be due, at least in part, to
enhanced a- to ß-cell transdifferentiation.

Epileptic Encephalopathy (EE) is a heterogeneous condition in which cognitive,
sensory and/or motor functions deteriorate as a consequence of epileptic
activity, which consists of frequent seizures and/or major interictal paroxysmal 
activity. There are various causes of EE and they may occur at any age in early
childhood. Genetic mutations have been identified to contribute to an increasing 
number of children with early onset EE which had been previously considered as
cryptogenic. We identified 26 patients with Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy
(IEE) of unknown etiology despite extensive workup and without any specific
epilepsy syndromic phenotypes. We performed genetic analysis on a panel of 7
genes (ARX, CDKL5, KCNQ2, PCDH19, SCN1A, SCN2A, STXBP1) and identified 10 point
mutations [ARX (1), CDKL5 (3), KCNQ2 (2), PCDH19 (1), SCN1A (1), STXBP1 (2)] as
well as one microdeletion involving both SCN1A and SCN2A. The high rate (42%) of 
mutations suggested that genetic testing of this IEE panel of genes is
recommended for cryptogenic IEE with no etiology identified. These 7 genes are
associated with channelopathies or synaptic transmission and we recommend early
genetic testing if possible to guide the treatment strategy.

Diffuse congenital hyperinsulinism in infancy (CHI-D) arises from mutations
inactivating the KATP channel; however, the phenotype is difficult to explain
from electrophysiology alone. Here we studied wider abnormalities in the ß-cell
and other pancreatic lineages. Islets were disorganized in CHI-D compared with
controls. PAX4 and ARX expression was decreased. A tendency toward increased
NKX2.2 expression was consistent with its detection in two-thirds of CHI-D d-cell
nuclei, similar to the fetal pancreas, and implied immature d-cell function.
CHI-D d-cells also comprised 10% of cells displaying nucleomegaly. In CHI-D,
increased proliferation was most elevated in duct (5- to 11-fold) and acinar (7- 
to 47-fold) lineages. Increased ß-cell proliferation observed in some cases was
offset by an increase in apoptosis; this is in keeping with no difference in
INSULIN expression or surface area stained for insulin between CHI-D and control 
pancreas. However, nuclear localization of CDK6 and P27 was markedly enhanced in 
CHI-D ß-cells compared with cytoplasmic localization in control cells. These
combined data support normal ß-cell mass in CHI-D, but with G1/S molecules
positioned in favor of cell cycle progression. New molecular abnormalities in
d-cells and marked proliferative increases in other pancreatic lineages indicate 
CHI-D is not solely a ß-cell disorder.

The homeodomain transcription factor Pdx1 controls pancreas organogenesis,
specification of endocrine pancreas progenitors, and the postnatal growth and
function of pancreatic ß-cells. Pdx1 expression in human-derived stem cells is
used as a marker for induced pancreatic precursor cells. Unfortunately, the
differentiation efficiency of human pancreatic progenitors into functional
ß-cells is poor. In order to gain insight into the genes that Pdx1 regulates
during differentiation, we performed Pdx1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed 
by high-throughput sequencing of embryonic day (e) 13.5 and 15.5 mouse pancreata.
From this, we identified the transcription factor Teashirt zinc finger 1 (Tshz1) 
as a direct Pdx1 target. Tshz1 is expressed in developing and adult insulin- and 
glucagon-positive cells. Endocrine cells are properly specified in Tshz1-null
embryos, but critical regulators of ß-cell (Pdx1 and Nkx6.1) and a-cell (MafB and
Arx) formation and function are downregulated. Adult Tshz1(+/-) mice display
glucose intolerance due to defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
associated with reduced Pdx1 and Clec16a expression in Tshz1(+/-) islets. Lastly,
we demonstrate that TSHZ1 levels are reduced in human islets of donors with type 
2 diabetes. Thus, we position Tshz1 in the transcriptional network of maturing
ß-cells and suggest that its dysregulation could contribute to the islet
phenotype of human type 2 diabetes.

The interconversion of cell lineages via transdifferentiation is an adaptive mode
of tissue regeneration and an appealing therapeutic target. However, its clinical
exploitation is contingent upon the discovery of contextual regulators of cell
fate acquisition and maintenance. In murine models of diabetes,
glucagon-secreting alpha cells transdifferentiate into insulin-secreting beta
cells following targeted beta cell depletion, regenerating the form and function 
of the pancreatic islet. However, the molecular triggers of this mode of
regeneration are unknown. Here, using lineage-tracing assays in a transgenic
zebrafish model of beta cell ablation, we demonstrate conserved plasticity of
alpha cells during islet regeneration. In addition, we show that glucagon
expression is upregulated after injury. Through gene knockdown and rescue
approaches, we also find that peptides derived from the glucagon gene are
necessary for alpha-to-beta cell fate switching. Importantly, whereas beta cell
neogenesis was stimulated by glucose, alpha-to-beta cell conversion was not,
suggesting that transdifferentiation is not mediated by glucagon/GLP-1 control of
hepatic glucose production. Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that
alpha cells are an endogenous reservoir of potential new beta cells. It further
reveals that glucagon plays an important role in maintaining endocrine cell
homeostasis through feedback mechanisms that govern cell fate stability.

The a and ß cells act in concert to maintain blood glucose. The a cells release
glucagon in response to low levels of glucose to stimulate glycogenolysis in the 
liver. In contrast, ß cells release insulin in response to elevated levels of
glucose to stimulate peripheral glucose disposal. Despite these opposing roles in
glucose homeostasis, a and ß cells are derived from a common progenitor and share
many proteins important for glucose sensing and hormone secretion. Results from
recent work have underlined these similarities between the two cell types by
revealing that ß-to-a as well as a-to-ß transdifferentiation can take place under
certain experimental circumstances. These exciting findings highlight unexpected 
plasticity of adult islets and offer hope of novel therapeutic paths to replenish
ß cells in diabetes. In this review, we focus on the transcription factor
networks that establish and maintain pancreatic endocrine cell identity and how
they may be perturbed to facilitate transdifferentiation.

This study reports on a 9-year-old girl who developed West syndrome and showed
clinical features fulfilling the main revised diagnostic criteria for typical
Rett syndrome (hand washing, severe cognitive impairment with absence of
language, ataxic gait, progressive scoliosis and autistic features). Mutation
analyses for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5
(CDKL5/STK9), ARX and Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) genes were carried out, with
negative results. A known de-novo c.1217G>A missense mutation in exon 14 leading 
to the substitution of a conserved residue, p.R406H in domain3b of the
syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1) gene, was detected. The STXBP1 gene encodes
the syntaxin-binding protein 1, a neuron-specific protein involved in synaptic
vesicle release at both glutaminergic and GABAergic synapses. This function is
also affected by MECP2 gene mutations, which are known to lead to a decrease in
glutamate and GABA receptors' density. It is possible to speculate that the
impairment in synaptic plasticity represents the pathogenic link between MECP2
and STXBP1 gene mutations. On reviewing the clinical features of the reported
patients with the same mutation in the STXBP1 gene, it has been observed that
poor eye contact, tremour, dyskinesia, head/hand stereotypies and both cognitive 
and motor progressive deterioration are common symptoms, although never
considered as indicative of a Rett syndrome phenotype. In conclusion, the case
described here suggests a relationship between the Rett syndrome and the STXBP1
gene not described so far, making the search for STXBP1 gene mutations advisable 
in patients with Rett syndrome and early onset of epilepsy.

Identification of anaerobic arsenite-oxidizing and arsenate-reducing bacteria
associated with an alkaline saline lake in Khovsgol, Mongolia.

Hamamura N, Itai T, Liu Y, Reysenbach AL, Damdinsuren N, Inskeep WP.

Microbial arsenic transformation pathways associated with a saline lake located
in northern Mongolia were examined using molecular biological and culturing
approaches. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from saline lake
sediments and soils were affiliated with haloalkaliphiles, including Bacillus and
Halomonas spp. Diverse sequences of arsenate respiratory reductase (arrA) and a
new group of arsenite oxidase (arxA) genes were also identified. Pure cultures of
arsenate-reducing Nitrincola strain and anaerobic arsenite-oxidizing Halomonas
strain were isolated. The chemoorganotrophic Halomonas strain contains arxA gene 
similar to that of a chemoautotrophic arsenite-oxidizing Alkalilimnicola
ehrlichii strain MLHE-1. These results revealed the diversity of arsenic
transformation pathways associated with a geographically distinct saline system
and the potential contribution of arx-dependent arsenite oxidation by
heterotrophic bacteria.

Rapid model identification for online subcutaneous glucose concentration
prediction for new subjects with type I diabetes.

Zhao C, Yu C.

GOAL: For conventional modeling methods, the work of model identification has to 
be repeated with sufficient data for each subject because different subjects may 
have different response to exogenous inputs. This may cause repetitive cost and
burden for patients and clinicians and require a lot of modeling efforts. Here,
to overcome the aforementioned problems, a rapid model development strategy for
new subjects is proposed using the idea of model migration for online glucose
prediction.
METHODS: First, a base model is obtained that can be empirically identified from 
any subject or constructed by a priori knowledge. Then, parameters of inputs in
the base model are properly revised based on a small amount of new data from new 
subjects so that the updated models can reflect the specific glucose dynamics
excited by inputs for new subjects. These problems are investigated by developing
autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) based on 30 in silico subjects 
using UVA/Padova metabolic simulator.
RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of the rapid modeling method is comparable to
that for subject-dependent modeling method for some cases. Also, it can present
better generalization ability.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method can be regarded as an effective and economic
modeling method instead of repetitive subject-dependent modeling method
especially for lack of modeling data.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factor OSG-1 confers functional aging via
dysregulated Rho signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons.

Rho signaling regulates a variety of biological processes, but whether it is
implicated in aging remains an open question. Here we show that a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor of the Dbl family, OSG-1, confers functional aging by 
dysregulating Rho GTPases activities in C. elegans. Thus, gene reporter analysis 
revealed widespread OSG-1 expression in muscle and neurons. Loss of OSG-1 gene
function was not associated with developmental defects. In contrast, suppression 
of OSG-1 lessened loss of function (chemotaxis) in ASE sensory neurons subjected 
to conditions of oxidative stress generated during natural aging, by oxidative
challenges, or by genetic mutations. RNAi analysis showed that OSG-1 was specific
toward activation of RHO-1 GTPase signaling. RNAi further implicated
actin-binding proteins ARX-3 and ARX-5, thus the actin cytoskeleton, as one of
the targets of OSG-1/RHO-1 signaling. Taken together these data suggest that
OSG-1 is recruited under conditions of oxidative stress, a hallmark of aging, and
contributes to promote loss of neuronal function by affecting the actin
cytoskeleton via altered RHO-1 activity.

Overexpression of PAX4 reduces glucagon expression in differentiating hESCs.

Gage BK(1), Baker RK, Kieffer TJ.

Author information: 
(1)a Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences; University of British
Columbia; Vancouver, BC Canada.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent and capable of generating new 
ß-cells, but current in vitro differentiation protocols generally fail to produce
mature, glucose-responsive, unihormonal ß-cells. Instead, these methods tend to
produce immature polyhormonal endocrine cells which mature in vivo into
glucagon-positive a-cells. PAX4 is an established transcription factor in ß-cell 
development and function, and is capable of converting glucagon-positive cells to
insulin-positive cells in mice. Work in human and mouse ESCs has shown that
constitutive PAX4 expression promotes the development of insulin-positive cells, 
but whether acute PAX4 expression is sufficient to guide specific endocrine cell 
fates has not been addressed in hESCs. In this study, we applied recombinant
adenovirus to ectopically express human PAX4 in hESC-derived pancreatic
progenitors, with the aim of influencing the endocrine developmental cascade away
from polyhormonal cells toward unihormonal insulin-positive cells. Gene delivery 
to pancreatic progenitors was efficient and dose-dependent. By the end of in
vitro differentiation, PAX4 reduced ARX expression, but only the high dose tested
significantly reduced glucagon release. Single cell analysis revealed that while 
PAX4 did not alter the proportion of endocrine cells, it did reduce the number of
glucagon-positive cells and increased the number of unihormonal insulin-positive 
cells. These data suggest that acute PAX4 overexpression can reduce expression of
ARX and glucagon resulting in improved numbers of unihormonal insulin-positive
cells.

Little is known about genetic mechanisms that regulate the ratio of cortical
excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We show that NPAS1 and NPAS3 transcription
factors (TFs) are expressed in progenitor domains of the mouse basal ganglia
(subpallium, MGE, and CGE). NPAS1(-/-) mutants had increased proliferation, ERK
signaling, and expression of Arx in the MGE and CGE. NPAS1(-/-) mutants also had 
increased neocortical inhibition (sIPSC and mIPSC) and generated an excess of
somatostatin(+) (SST) (MGE-derived) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(+)
(VIP) (CGE-derived) neocortical interneurons, but had a normal density of
parvalbumin(+) (PV) (MGE-derived) interneurons. In contrast, NPAS3(-/-) mutants
showed decreased proliferation and ERK signaling in progenitors of the ganglionic
eminences and had fewer SST(+) and VIP(+) interneurons. NPAS1 repressed activity 
of an Arx enhancer, and Arx overexpression resulted in increased proliferation of
CGE progenitors. These results provide insights into genetic regulation of
cortical interneuron numbers and cortical inhibitory tone.

Characterization of homeobox genes reveals sophisticated regionalization of the
central nervous system in the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis.

Cephalopod mollusks possess a number of anatomical traits that often parallel
vertebrates in morphological complexity, including a centralized nervous system
with sophisticated cognitive functionality. Very little is known about the
genetic mechanisms underlying patterning of the cephalopod embryo to arrive at
this anatomical structure. Homeodomain (HD) genes are transcription factors that 
regulate transcription of downstream genes through DNA binding, and as such are
integral parts of gene regulatory networks controlling the specification and
patterning of body parts across lineages. We have used a degenerate primer
strategy to isolate homeobox genes active during late-organogenesis from the
European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. With this approach we have isolated
fourteen HD gene fragments and examine the expression profiles of five of these
genes during late stage (E24-28) embryonic development (Sof-Gbx, Sof-Hox3,
Sof-Arx, Sof-Lhx3/4, Sof-Vsx). All five genes are expressed within the developing
central nervous system in spatially restricted and largely non-overlapping
domains. Our data provide a first glimpse into the diversity of HD genes in one
of the largest, yet least studied, metazoan clades and illustrate how HD gene
expression patterns reflect the functional partitioning of the cephalopod brain.

Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) can simultaneously monitor the
spatiotemporal electrical dynamics of thousands of neurons and is often used to
identify functional differences in models of neurological disease. While the
chief advantage of VSDI is the ability to record spatiotemporal activity, there
are no tools available to visualize and statistically compare activity across the
full spatiotemporal range of the VSDI dataset. Investigators commonly analyze
only a subset of the data, and a majority of the dataset is routinely excluded
from analysis. We have developed a software toolbox that simplifies visual
inspection of VSDI data, and permits unaided statistical comparison across
spatial and temporal dimensions. First, the three-dimensional VSDI dataset
(x,y,time) is geometrically transformed into a two-dimensional spatiotemporal map
of activity. Second, statistical comparison between groups is performed using a
non-parametric permutation test. The result is a 2D map of all significant
differences in both space and time. Here, we used the toolbox to identify
functional differences in activity in VSDI data from acute hippocampal slices
obtained from epileptic Arx conditional knock-out and control mice. Maps of
spatiotemporal activity were produced and analyzed to identify differences in the
activity evoked by stimulation of each of two axonal inputs to the hippocampus:
the perforant pathway and the temporoammonic pathway. In mutant hippocampal
slices, the toolbox identified a widespread decrease in spatiotemporal activity
evoked by the temporoammonic pathway. No significant differences were observed in
the activity evoked by the perforant pathway. The VSDI toolbox permitted us to
visualize and statistically compare activity across the spatiotemporal scope of
the VSDI dataset. Sampling error was minimized because the representation of the 
data is standardized by the toolbox. Statistical comparisons were conducted
quickly, across the spatiotemporal scope of the data, without a priori knowledge 
of the character of the responses or the likely differences between them.

OBJECTIVES: Severe congenital diarrhea occurs in approximately half of patients
with Aristaless-Related Homeobox (ARX) null mutations. The cause of this diarrhea
is unknown. In a mouse model of intestinal Arx deficiency, the prevalence of a
subset of enteroendocrine cells is altered, leading to diarrhea. Because
polyalanine expansions within the ARX protein are the most common mutations found
in ARX-related disorders, we sought to characterize the enteroendocrine
population in human tissue of an ARX mutation and in a mouse model of the
corresponding polyalanine expansion (Arx).
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction were the primary modalities used to characterize the enteroendocrine
populations. Daily weights were determined for the growth curves, and Oil-Red-O
staining on stool and tissue identified neutral fats.
RESULTS: An expansion of 7 alanines in the first polyalanine tract of both human 
ARX and mouse Arx altered enteroendocrine differentiation. In human tissue,
cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and somatostatin populations were
reduced, whereas the chromogranin A population was unchanged. In the mouse model,
cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide 1 populations were also lost, although 
the somatostatin-expressing population was increased. The ARX protein was present
in human tissue, whereas the Arx protein was degraded in the mouse intestine.
CONCLUSIONS: ARX/Arx is required for the specification of a subset of
enteroendocrine cells in both humans and mice. Owing to protein degradation, the 
Arx mouse recapitulates findings of the intestinal Arx null model, but is not
able to further the study of the differential effects of the ARX protein on its
transcriptional targets in the intestine.

The growing list of mutations implicated in monogenic disorders of the developing
brain includes at least seven genes (ARX, CUL4B, KDM5A, KDM5C, KMT2A, KMT2C,
KMT2D) with loss-of-function mutations affecting proper regulation of histone H3 
lysine 4 methylation, a chromatin mark which on a genome-wide scale is broadly
associated with active gene expression, with its mono-, di- and trimethylated
forms differentially enriched at promoter and enhancer and other regulatory
sequences. In addition to these rare genetic syndromes, dysregulated H3K4
methylation could also play a role in the pathophysiology of some cases diagnosed
with autism or schizophrenia, two conditions which on a genome-wide scale are
associated with H3K4 methylation changes at hundreds of loci in a
subject-specific manner. Importantly, the reported alterations for some of the
diseased brain specimens included a widespread broadening of H3K4 methylation
profiles at gene promoters, a process that could be regulated by the
UpSET(KMT2E/MLL5)-histone deacetylase complex. Furthermore, preclinical studies
identified maternal immune activation, parental care and monoaminergic drugs as
environmental determinants for brain-specific H3K4 methylation. These novel
insights into the epigenetic risk architectures of neurodevelopmental disease
will be highly relevant for efforts aimed at improved prevention and treatment of
autism and psychosis spectrum disorders.

A child with a novel de novo mutation in the aristaless domain of the
aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene presenting with ambiguous genitalia and
psychomotor delay.

The objective of this study was to identify disease-causing mutations in a Sri
Lankan male child presenting with ambiguous genitalia and psychomotor delay using
the exome sequencing approach. A novel mutation in the aristaless-related
homeobox (ARX) gene causing a hemizygous nucleotide substitution in exon 5 was
identified (NM_139058.2 (ARX): c.1614G>T; p.K538N). This change causes a
nonsynonymous substitution in the aristaless domain within the ARX protein which 
is predicted to be deleterious. This is the first reported case of ambiguous
genitalia and psychomotor delay associated with this novel missense mutation
within the ARX protein, and it highlights the value of exome sequencing even in
sporadic cases.

We report here on four males from three families carrying de novo or inherited
small Xp22.13 duplications including the ARX gene detected by chromosomal
microarray analysis (CMA). Two of these males had normal intelligence. Our report
suggests that, unlike other XLMR genes like MECP2 and FMR1, the presence of an
extra copy of the ARX gene may not be sufficient to perturb its developmental
functions. ARX duplication does not inevitably have detrimental effects on brain 
development, in contrast with the effects of ARX haploinsufficiency. The abnormal
phenotype ascribed to the presence of an extra copy in some male patients may
have resulted from the effect of another, not yet identified, chromosomal or
molecular anomaly, alone or in association with ARX duplication.

A variable projection approach for efficient estimation of RBF-ARX model.

Gan M, Li HX, Peng H.

The radial basis function network-based autoregressive with exogenous inputs
(RBF-ARX) models have much more linear parameters than nonlinear parameters.
Taking advantage of this special structure, a variable projection algorithm is
proposed to estimate the model parameters more efficiently by eliminating the
linear parameters through the orthogonal projection. The proposed method not only
substantially reduces the dimension of parameter space of RBF-ARX model but also 
results in a better-conditioned problem. In this paper, both the full Jacobian
matrix of Golub and Pereyra and the Kaufman's simplification are used to test the
performance of the algorithm. An example of chaotic time series modeling is
presented for the numerical comparison. It clearly demonstrates that the proposed
approach is computationally more efficient than the previous structured nonlinear
parameter optimization method and the conventional Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm 
without the parameters separated. Finally, the proposed method is also applied to
a simulated nonlinear single-input single-output process, a time-varying
nonlinear process and a real multiinput multioutput nonlinear industrial process 
to illustrate its usefulness.

Mutations in the Aristaless related homeodomain transcription factor (ARX) are
associated with a diverse set of X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy
syndromes in humans. Although most studies have been focused on its function in
the forebrain, ARX is also expressed in other regions of the developing nervous
system including the floor plate (FP) of the spinal cord where its function is
incompletely understood. To investigate the role of Arx in the FP, we performed
gain-of-function studies in the chick using in ovo electroporation, and
loss-of-function studies in Arx-deficient mice. We have found that Arx, in
conjunction with FoxA2, directly induces Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression through 
binding to a Shh floor plate enhancer (SFPE2). We also observed that FoxA2
induces Arx through its transcriptional activation domain whereas Nkx2.2, induced
by Shh, abolishes this induction. Our data support a feedback loop model for Arx 
function; through interactions with FoxA2, Arx positively regulates Shh
expression in the FP, and Shh signaling in turn activates Nkx2.2, which
suppresses Arx expression. Furthermore, our data are evidence that Arx plays a
role as a context dependent transcriptional activator, rather than a primary
inducer of Shh expression, potentially explaining how mutations in ARX are
associated with diverse, and often subtle, defects.

This paper provides the model predictive control (MPC) of fractional order
systems. The direct method will be used as internal model to predict the future
dynamic behavior of the process, which is used to achieve the control law. This
method is based on the Grünwald-Letnikov's definition that consists of replacing 
the noninteger derivation operator of the adopted system representation by a
discrete approximation. The performances and the efficiency of this approach are 
illustrated with practical results on a thermal system and compared to the MPC
based on the integer ARX model.

BACKGROUND: Patient-derived tumour xenografts are an attractive model for
preclinical testing of anti-cancer drugs. Insights into tumour biology and
biomarkers predictive of responses to chemotherapeutic drugs can also be gained
from investigating xenograft models. As a first step towards examining the
equivalence of epigenetic profiles between xenografts and primary tumours in
paediatric leukaemia, we performed genome-scale DNA methylation and gene
expression profiling on a panel of 10 paediatric B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) tumours that were stratified by prednisolone
response.
RESULTS: We found high correlations in DNA methylation and gene expression
profiles between matching primary and xenograft tumour samples with Pearson's
correlation coefficients ranging between 0.85 and 0.98. In order to demonstrate
the potential utility of epigenetic analyses in BCP-ALL xenografts, we identified
DNA methylation biomarkers that correlated with prednisolone responsiveness of
the original tumour samples. Differential methylation of CAPS2, ARHGAP21, ARX and
HOXB6 were confirmed by locus specific analysis. We identified 20 genes showing
an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in
association with prednisolone response. Pathway analysis of these genes
implicated apoptosis, cell signalling and cell structure networks in prednisolone
responsiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm the stability of epigenetic and
gene expression profiles of paediatric BCP-ALL propagated in mouse xenograft
models. Further, our preliminary investigation of prednisolone sensitivity
highlights the utility of mouse xenograft models for preclinical development of
novel drug regimens with parallel investigation of underlying gene expression and
epigenetic responses associated with novel drug responses.

An essential component of any artificial pancreas is on the prediction of blood
glucose levels as a function of exogenous and endogenous perturbations such as
insulin dose, meal intake, and physical activity and emotional tone under natural
living conditions. In this article, we present a new data-driven state-space
dynamic model with time-varying coefficients that are used to explicitly quantify
the time-varying patient-specific effects of insulin dose and meal intake on
blood glucose fluctuations. Using the 3-variate time series of glucose level,
insulin dose, and meal intake of an individual type 1 diabetic subject, we apply 
an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate time-varying coefficients of the
patient-specific state-space model. We evaluate our empirical modeling using (1) 
the FDA-approved UVa/Padova simulator with 30 virtual patients and (2) clinical
data of 5 type 1 diabetic patients under natural living conditions. Compared to a
forgetting-factor-based recursive ARX model of the same order, the EKF model
predictions have higher fit, and significantly better temporal gain and J index
and thus are superior in early detection of upward and downward trends in
glucose. The EKF based state-space model developed in this article is
particularly suitable for model-based state-feedback control designs since the
Kalman filter estimates the state variable of the glucose dynamics based on the
measured glucose time series. In addition, since the model parameters are
estimated in real time, this model is also suitable for adaptive control.

Effects of valproic acid on gene expression during human embryonic stem cell
differentiation into neurons.

Author information: 
(1)Environmental Health Science Laboratory, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.

The widely used antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is known to exhibit
teratogenicity in the form of a failure of the neural tube in humans. Embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) are reported to be a promising cell source for evaluating
chemical teratogenicity, because they are capable of reproducing embryonic
developmental model and enable reduction in the number of experimental animals
used. We previously investigated 22 genes for which expressions are altered by
teratogens, specifically focusing on neural differentiation of mouse ESCs. In the
present study, expressions of the investigated genes were evaluated by
quantitative real-time PCR and compared during differentiation of human ESCs into
neurons with or without VPA. Under the conditions, almost all gene expressions
significantly changed in VPA-containing culture. Specifically, in neural
development-related genes such as DCX, ARX, MAP2, and NNAT, more than 2-fold
expression was observed. The findings suggest that the genes focused on in this
study may help to elucidate the teratogenic effects of VPA and might be a useful 
tool to analyze embryotoxic potential of chemicals in humans.

A nonlinear generalization of spectral Granger causality.

He F, Wei HL, Billings SA, Sarrigiannis PG.

Spectral measures of linear Granger causality have been widely applied to study
the causal connectivity between time series data in neuroscience, biology, and
economics. Traditional Granger causality measures are based on linear
autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) inputs models of time series data, which
cannot truly reveal nonlinear effects in the data especially in the frequency
domain. In this study, it is shown that the classical Geweke's spectral causality
measure can be explicitly linked with the output spectra of corresponding
restricted and unrestricted time-domain models. The latter representation is then
generalized to nonlinear bivariate signals and for the first time nonlinear
causality analysis in the frequency domain. This is achieved by using the
nonlinear ARX (NARX) modeling of signals, and decomposition of the recently
defined output frequency response function which is related to the NARX model.

AIMS: Children conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) display
vascular dysfunction. Its underlying mechanism, potential reversibility and
long-term consequences for cardiovascular risk are unknown. In mice, ART induces 
arterial hypertension and shortens the life span. These problems are related to
decreased vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and nitric
oxide (NO) synthesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether ART-induced 
vascular dysfunction in humans is related to a similar mechanism and potentially 
reversible. To this end we tested whether antioxidants improve endothelial
function by scavenging free radicals and increasing NO bioavailability.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective double-blind placebo controlled study in
21 ART and 21 control children we assessed the effects of a four-week oral
supplementation with antioxidant vitamins C (1<U+2009>g) and E (400<U+2009>IU) or placebo
(allocation ratio 2:1) on flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery
and pulmonary artery pressure (echocardiography) during high-altitude exposure
(3454<U+2009>m), a manoeuver known to facilitate the detection of pulmonary vascular
dysfunction and to decrease NO bioavailability by stimulating oxidative stress.
Antioxidant supplementation significantly increased plasma NO measured by
ozone-based chemiluminescence (from 21.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>7.9 to 26.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>7.6<U+2009>µM, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) and
FMD (from 7.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.1 to 8.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.0%, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004) and attenuated altitude-induced
pulmonary hypertension (from 33<U+2009>±<U+2009>8 to 28<U+2009>±<U+2009>6<U+2009>mm Hg, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.028) in ART children, 
whereas it had no detectable effect in control children.
CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidant administration to ART children improved NO
bioavailability and vascular responsiveness in the systemic and pulmonary
circulation. Collectively, these findings indicate that in young individuals
ART-induced vascular dysfunction is subject to redox regulation and reversible.

The effects of the interaction between Suillus luteus (L.) Roussel and
Trichoderma virens (J.H. Mill., Giddens & A.A. Foster) Arx on Pinus sylvestris
var. mongolica Litv. were studied using plant physiology, mycorrhizal science,
forest pathology, and biochemistry. Seedling growth and physiological parameters 
were determined, including the colonization rate of mycorrhizal fungi, biomass,
root activity, photosynthetic pigment content, soluble protein content,
antioxidant enzyme activities, rhizosphere soil enzyme activities, and protective
enzyme activities. In addition, an optimal resistance system involving T. virens,
mycorrhizal fungus (S. luteus), and P. sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings was
constructed. Synergies between S. luteus and T. virens were observed, and most of
the parameters of P. sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings inoculated with S.
luteus 30 days + T. virens were higher than other treatments. After three months,
when compared the control, the S. luteus 30 days + T. virens treatment gave
increases in height (42.3 %); collar diameter (66.7 %); fresh weight (54 %); dry 
weight (50 %); soluble protein content (69.86 %); root activity (150 %);
chlorophyll a (77.6 %); chlorophyll b (70.5 %); carotenoids (144 %); CAT activity
(876.9 %); POD activity (268.3 %); SOD activity (66.18 %); ß-1,3-glucanase
activity (125.8 %); chitinase activity (40 %); rhizosphere soil catalase activity
(97.8 %); and phosphatase activity (266.7 %). These results indicate that there
may be a stimulating factor between S. luteus and T. virens when they are
inoculated together (S. luteus 30 days + T. virens).

Mutations in the Aristaless-Related Homeobox (ARX) gene cause structural
anomalies of the brain, epilepsy, and neurocognitive deficits in children. During
forebrain development, Arx is expressed in both pallial and subpallial progenitor
cells. We previously demonstrated that elimination of Arx from subpallial-derived
cortical interneurons generates an epilepsy phenotype with features overlapping
those seen in patients with ARX mutations. In this report, we have selectively
removed Arx from pallial progenitor cells that give rise to the cerebral cortical
projection neurons. While no discernable seizure activity was recorded, these
mice exhibited a peculiar constellation of behaviors. They are less anxious, less
social, and more active when compared with their wild-type littermates. The
overall cortical thickness was reduced, and the corpus callosum and anterior
commissure were hypoplastic, consistent with a perturbation in cortical
connectivity. Taken together, these data suggest that some of the structural and 
behavioral anomalies, common in patients with ARX mutations, are specifically due
to alterations in pallial progenitor function. Furthermore, our data demonstrate 
that some of the neurobehavioral features found in patients with ARX mutations
may not be due to on-going seizures, as is often postulated, given that epilepsy

Infantile spasms (IS) is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy of unknown
etiology in ~40% of patients. We hypothesized that unexplained IS cases represent
a large collection of rare single-gene disorders. We investigated 44 children
with unexplained IS using comparative genomic hybridisation arrays (aCGH) (n =
44) followed by targeted sequencing of 35 known epilepsy genes (n = 8) or
whole-exome sequencing (WES) of familial trios (n = 18) to search for rare
inherited or de novo mutations. aCGH analysis revealed de novo variants in 7% of 
patients (n = 3/44), including a distal 16p11.2 duplication, a 15q11.1q13.1
tetrasomy and a 2q21.3-q22.2 deletion. Furthermore, it identified a pathogenic
maternally inherited Xp11.2 duplication. Targeted sequencing was informative for 
ARX (n = 1/14) and STXBP1 (n = 1/8). In contrast, sequencing of a panel of 35
known epileptic encephalopathy genes (n = 8) did not identify further mutations. 
Finally, WES (n = 18) was very informative, with an excess of de novo mutations
identified in genes predicted to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes
and/or known to be intolerant to functional variations. Several pathogenic
mutations were identified, including de novo mutations in STXBP1, CASK and ALG13,
as well as recessive mutations in PNPO and ADSL, together explaining 28% of cases
(5/18). In addition, WES identified 1-3 de novo variants in 64% of remaining
probands, pointing to several interesting candidate genes. Our results indicate
that IS are genetically heterogeneous with a major contribution of de novo
mutations and that WES is significantly superior to targeted re-sequencing in
identifying detrimental genetic variants involved in IS.

Cortical GABAergic interneurons have essential roles for information processing
and their dysfunction is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Transcriptional codes are elucidating mechanisms of interneuron specification in 
the MGE (a subcortical progenitor zone), which regulate their migration,
integration, and function within cortical circuitry. Lhx6, a LIM-homeodomain
transcription factor, is essential for specification of MGE-derived somatostatin 
and parvalbumin interneurons. Here, we demonstrate that some Lhx6<U+207B>/<U+207B> MGE cells
acquire a CGE-like fate. Using an in vivo MGE complementation/transplantation
assay, we show that Lhx6-regulated genes Arx and CXCR7 rescue divergent aspects
of Lhx6<U+207B>/<U+207B> cell-fate and laminar mutant phenotypes and provide insight into a
neonatal role for CXCR7 in MGE-derived interneuron lamination. Finally, Lhx6
directly binds in vivo to an Arx enhancer and to an intronic CXCR7 enhancer that 
remains active in mature interneurons. These data define the molecular identity
of Lhx6 mutants and introduce technologies to test mechanisms in GABAergic
interneuron differentiation.

Soil microbiomes are a rich source of uncharacterized natural product
biosynthetic gene clusters. Here we use short conserved biosynthetic gene
sequences (natural product sequence tags) amplified from soil microbiomes as
phylogenetic markers to correlate genotype to chemotype and target the discovery 
of novel bioactive pentangular polyphenols from the environment. The heterologous
expression of an environmental DNA-derived gene cluster (the ARX cluster), whose 
ketosynthase beta (KSß) sequence tag was phylogenetically distinct from any known
KSß sequence, led to the discovery of the arixanthomycins. Arixanthomycin A (1)
exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines.

A common in frame duplication in ARX (c.431_454dup24) was found in a five
year-old boy who presented with mild Partington syndrome. The duplication was
detected by PCR amplification followed by fragment length analysis and was
located in exon 2 spanning the two polyalanine tracts commonly seen to expand.
Detection of the duplication by DNA sequencing was difficult due to preferential 
sequencing of the normal allele, demonstrating the superiority of fragment length
analysis in mosaic cases. The clinical symptoms were mild to moderate
developmental delay with only the hand dystonia to suggest Partington syndrome.
This patient is the first male reported to be mosaic for the duplication, and his
clinical features are subtle. This study shows that in males with a phenotype of 
mild Partington syndrome and in heterozygous females fragment length analysis
should be preferred over DNA sequencing.

An elevated odds ratio for low IQ has been found for cryptorchid boys.
Furthermore, poor school performance has been observed in cryptorchid boys with
impaired mini-puberty. Gene expression analysis, qPCR and immunohistology were
performed on testicular biopsies from 7 boys who underwent orchiopexy and had
testicular histology typical of a high risk of infertility (HIR). The results
were compared with 12 biopsies from cryptorchid boys with a low risk for
developing infertility. The following genes associated with mental retardation
were identically expressed: GDI1, OPHN1, PAK3, ARHGEF6, IL1RAPL, ACSL4, MECP2,
RPS6KA3, ARX, and ATRX. However, boys in the HIR group had low or no expression
of EGR4, FMR2 (AFF2) and VCX3A. In conclusion, impaired expression of genes known
to encode proteins involved in signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal
organization, synaptic vesicle transport and the establishment of connections
between neuronal cells may contribute to reduced intellectual and cognitive
functioning in infertile cryptorchid males.

Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of neurodevelopmental
disorders starting in early childhood and is characterized by impairments in
communication and reciprocal social interaction and presence of restricted and
repetitive patterns of behavior. The contribution of genetic factors to autism is
clear in twin and family studies. It is apparent that, overall, ASD is a complex 
non-Mendelian disorder. Recent studies suggest that copy number variations (CNVs)
play a significant role in the etiology of ASD. For the current work, we
recruited 245 family members from 73 ASD families from Styria, Austria. The DNA
from probands was genotyped with Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
6.0 microarrays to screen for CNVs in their genomes. Analysis of the microarray
data was performed using three different algorithms, and a list of stringent
calls was compared to existing CNV data from over 2,357 controls of European
ancestry. For stringent calls not present in controls, quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) was used to validate the CNVs in the probands and in their family
members. Twenty-two CNVs were validated from this set (five of which are
apparently de novo), many of which appear likely to disrupt genes that may be
considered as good candidates for neuropsychiatric disorders, including DLG2,
S100B, ARX, DIP2A, HPCAL1, and GPHN. Several others disrupt genes that have
previously been implicated in autism, such as BDNF, AUTS2, DPP6, and C18orf22,
and our data add to the growing evidence of their involvement in ASD.

A plastic nervous system requires the ability not only to acquire and store but
also to forget. Here, we report that musashi (msi-1) is necessary for
time-dependent memory loss in C. elegans. Tissue-specific rescue demonstrates
that MSI-1 function is necessary in the AVA interneuron. Using RNA-binding
protein immunoprecipitation (IP), we found that MSI-1 binds to mRNAs of three
subunits of the Arp2/3 actin branching regulator complex in vivo and
downregulates ARX-1, ARX-2, and ARX-3 translation upon associative learning. The 
role of msi-1 in forgetting is also reflected by the persistence of
learning-induced GLR-1 synaptic size increase in msi-1 mutants. We demonstrate
that memory length is regulated cooperatively through the activation of adducin
(add-1) and by the inhibitory effect of msi-1. Thus, a GLR-1/MSI-1/Arp2/3 pathway
induces forgetting and represents a novel mechanism of memory decay by linking
translational control to the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons.

Discovery and development of organic super-electron-donors.

Murphy JA(1).

Author information:

, 295 Cathedral Street, Glasgow G1 1XL, United Kingdom.

Based on simple ideas of electron-rich alkenes, exemplified by
tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethene, TDAE, and on additional driving force associated
with aromatization, families of very powerful neutral organic
super-electron-donors (SEDs) have been developed. In the ground state, they carry
out metal-free reductions of a range of functional groups. Iodoarenes are reduced
either to aryl radicals or, with stronger donors, to aryl anions. Reduction to
aryl radicals allows the initiation of very efficient transition-metal-free
coupling of haloarenes to arenes. The donors also reduce alkyl halides,
arenesulfonamides, triflates, and triflamdes, Weinreb amides, and acyloin
derivatives. Under photoactivation at 365 nm, they are even more powerful and
reductively cleave aryl chlorides. They reduce unactivated benzenes to the
corresponding radical anions and display original selectivities in preferentially
reducing benzenes over malonates or cyanoacetates. Additionally, they reductively
cleave ArC-X, ArX-C (X = N or O) and ArC-C bonds, provided that the two resulting
fragments are somewhat stabilized.

The mechanism of the reactions of aryl/heteroaryl halides with aryl Grignard
reagents catalyzed by [Fe(III)(acac)3] (acac=acetylacetonate) has been
investigated. It is shown that in the presence of excess PhMgBr, [Fe(III)(acac)3]
affords two reduced complexes: [PhFe(II)(acac)(thf)n] (n=1 or 2) (characterized
by (1)H NMR and cyclic voltammetry) and [PhFe(I)(acac)(thf)](-) (characterized by
cyclic voltammetry, (1)H NMR, EPR and DFT). Whereas [PhFe(II)(acac)(thf)n] does
not react with any of the investigated aryl or heteroaryl halides, the Fe(I)
complex [PhFe(I)(acac)(thf)](-) reacts with ArX (Ar=Ph, 4-tolyl; X=I, Br) through
an inner-sphere monoelectronic reduction (promoted by halogen bonding) to afford 
the corresponding arene ArH together with the Grignard homocoupling product PhPh.
In contrast, [PhFe(I)(acac)(thf)](-) reacts with a heteroaryl chloride
(2-chloropyridine) to afford the cross-coupling product (2-phenylpyridine)
through an oxidative addition/reductive elimination sequence. The mechanism of
the reaction of [PhFe(I)(acac)(thf)](-) with the aryl and heteroaryl halides has 
been explored on the basis of DFT calculations.

BACKGROUND: The c.429_452dup24 of the ARX gene is a rare genetic anomaly, leading
to X-Linked Intellectual Disability without brain malformation. While in certain 
cases c.429_452dup24 has been associated with specific clinical patterns such as 
Partington syndrome, the consequence of this mutation has been also often
classified as "non-specific Intellectual Disability". The present work aims at a 
more precise description of the clinical features linked to the c.429_452dup24
mutation.
METHODS: We clinically reviewed all affected patients identified in France over a
five-year period, i.e. 27 patients from 12 different families. Detailed
cognitive, behavioural, and motor evaluation, as well as standardized videotaped 
assessments of oro-lingual and gestural praxis, were performed. In a sub-group of
13 ARX patients, kinematic and MRI studies were further accomplished to better
characterize the motor impairment prevalent in the ARX patients group. To ensure 
that data were specific to the ARX gene mutation and did not result from
low-cognitive functioning per se, a group of 27 age- and IQ-matched Down syndrome
patients served as control.
RESULTS: Neuropsychological and motor assessment indicated that the
c.429_452dup24 mutation constitutes a recognizable clinical syndrome: ARX
patients exhibiting Intellectual Disability, without primary motor impairment,
but with a very specific upper limb distal motor apraxia associated with a
pathognomonic hand-grip. Patients affected with the so-called Partington
syndrome, which involves major hand dystonia and orolingual apraxia, exhibit the 
most severe symptoms of the disorder. The particular "reach and grip" impairment 
which was observed in all ARX patients, but not in Down syndrome patients, was
further characterized by the kinematic data: (i) loss of preference for the index
finger when gripping an object, (ii) major impairment of fourth finger deftness, 
and (iii) a lack of pronation movements. This lack of distal movement
coordination exhibited by ARX patients is associated with the loss of independent
digital dexterity and is similar to the distortion of individual finger movements
and posture observed in Limb Kinetic Apraxia.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the ARX c.429_452dup24 mutation may be a 
developmental model for Limb Kinetic Apraxia.

Arx is required for specification of the zona incerta and reticular nucleus of
the thalamus.

Mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene result in a spectrum of
structural and functional nervous system disorders including lissencephaly,
movement disorders, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy. Some patients also
have symptoms indicating hypothalamic dysfunction, but little is known about the 
role of ARX in diencephalic development. To begin evaluating diencephalic
defects, we examined the expression of a panel of known genes and gene products
that label specific diencephalic nuclei in 2 different Arx mutant mouse lines at 
E18.5. Male mice engineered to have a polyalanine expansion mutation (Arx)
revealed no expression differences in any diencephalic nucleus when compared with
wild-type littermates. In contrast, mice null for Arx (Arx) lost expression of
specific markers of the thalamic reticular nucleus and zona incerta (ZI) while
retaining expression in other thalamic nuclei and in the hypothalamus. Tyrosine
hydroxylase, a marker of the dopaminergic A13 subnucleus of ZI, was among those
lost, suggesting a requirement for Arx in normal thalamic reticular nucleus and
ZI development and, specifically, for A13 dopaminergic fate. Because the ZI and
A13 regions make connections to several hypothalamic nuclei, such
misspecification may contribute to the "hypothalamic dysfunction" observed in
some patients.

Grg3/TLE3 and Grg1/TLE1 induce monohormonal pancreatic ß-cells while repressing
a-cell functions.

In the pancreas, a- and ß-cells possess a degree of plasticity. In vitro
differentiation of pluripotent cells yields mostly a- and polyhormonal ß-like
cells, indicating a gap in understanding of how functional monohormonal ß-cells
are formed and of the endogenous repressive mechanisms used to maintain ß-cell
identity. We show that the corepressor Grg3 is expressed in almost all ß-cells
throughout embryogenesis to adulthood. However, Grg3 is expressed in fewer
nascent a-cells and is progressively lost from a-cells as endocrine cells mature 
into adulthood. We show that mouse Grg3(+/-) ß-cells have increased a-specific
gene expression, and Grg3(+/-) pancreata have more a-cells and more polyhormonal 
cells, indicating that Grg3 is required for the physiologic maintenance of
monohormonal ß-cell identity. Ectopic expression of Grg3 in a-cells represses
glucagon and Arx, and the addition of Pdx1 induces Glut2 expression and
glucose-responsive insulin secretion. Furthermore, we found that Grg1 is the
predominant Groucho expressed in human ß-cells but acts functionally similarly to
Grg3. Overall, we find that Grg3 and Grg1 establish a monohormonal ß-cell

infantile spasms syndrome.

Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Infantile spasms are a catastrophic form of pediatric epilepsy with inadequate
treatment. In patients, mutation of ARX, a transcription factor selectively
expressed in neuronal precursors and adult inhibitory interneurons, impairs cell 
migration and causes a major inherited subtype of the disease X-linked infantile 
spasms syndrome. Using an animal model, the Arx((GCG)10+7) mouse, we determined
that brief estradiol (E2) administration during early postnatal development
prevented spasms in infancy and seizures in adult mutants. E2 was ineffective
when delivered after puberty or 30 days after birth. Early E2 treatment altered
mRNA levels of three downstream targets of Arx (Shox2, Ebf3, and Lgi1) and
restored depleted interneuron populations without increasing GABAergic synaptic
density. Postnatal E2 treatment may induce lasting transcriptional changes that
lead to enduring disease modification and could potentially serve as a therapy
for inherited interneuronopathies.

Collaboration and data sharing have become core elements of biomedical research. 
Especially when sensitive data from distributed sources are linked, privacy
threats have to be considered. Statistical disclosure control allows the
protection of sensitive data by introducing fuzziness. Reduction of data quality,
however, needs to be balanced against gains in protection. Therefore, tools are
needed which provide a good overview of the anonymization process to those
responsible for data sharing. These tools require graphical interfaces and the
use of intuitive and replicable methods. In addition, extensive testing,
documentation and openness to reviews by the community are important. Existing
publicly available software is limited in functionality, and often active support
is lacking. We present ARX, an anonymization tool that i) implements a wide
variety of privacy methods in a highly efficient manner, ii) provides an
intuitive cross-platform graphical interface, iii) offers a programming interface
for integration into other software systems, and iv) is well documented and
actively supported.

Regionalized differentiation of CRH, TRH, and GHRH peptidergic neurons in the
mouse hypothalamus.

According to the updated prosomeric model, the hypothalamus is subdivided
rostrocaudally into terminal and peduncular parts, and dorsoventrally into alar, 
basal, and floor longitudinal zones. In this context, we examined the ontogeny of
peptidergic cell populations expressing Crh, Trh, and Ghrh mRNAs in the mouse
hypothalamus, comparing their distribution relative to the major progenitor
domains characterized by molecular markers such as Otp, Sim1, Dlx5, Arx, Gsh1,
and Nkx2.1. All three neuronal types originate mainly in the peduncular
paraventricular domain and less importantly at the terminal paraventricular
domain; both are characteristic alar Otp/Sim1-positive areas. Trh and Ghrh cells 
appeared specifically at the ventral subdomain of the cited areas after E10.5.
Additional Ghrh cells emerged separately at the tuberal arcuate area,
characterized by Nkx2.1 expression. Crh-positive cells emerged instead in the
central part of the peduncular paraventricular domain at E13.5 and remained
there. In contrast, as development progresses (E13.5-E18.5) many alar Ghrh and
Trh cells translocate into the alar subparaventricular area, and often also into 
underlying basal neighborhoods expressing Nkx2.1 and/or Dlx5, such as the tuberal
and retrotuberal areas, becoming partly or totally depleted at the original birth
sites. Our data correlate a topologic map of molecularly defined hypothalamic
progenitor areas with three types of specific neurons, each with restricted
spatial origins and differential migratory behavior during prenatal hypothalamic 
development. The study may be useful for detailed causal analysis of the
respective differential specification mechanisms. The postulated migrations also 
contribute to our understanding of adult hypothalamic complexity.

Initial cell seeding density influences pancreatic endocrine development during
in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.

Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the ability to form cells derived from
all three germ layers, and as such have received significant attention as a
possible source for insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells for diabetes
treatment. While considerable advances have been made in generating hESC-derived 
insulin-producing cells, to date in vitro-derived glucose-responsive beta-cells
have remained an elusive goal. With the objective of increasing the in vitro
formation of pancreatic endocrine cells, we examined the effect of varying
initial cell seeding density from 1.3 x 10(4) cells/cm(2) to 5.3 x 10(4)
cells/cm(2) followed by a 21-day pancreatic endocrine differentiation protocol.
Low density-seeded cells were found to be biased toward the G2/M phases of the
cell cycle and failed to efficiently differentiate into SOX17-CXCR4 co-positive
definitive endoderm cells leaving increased numbers of OCT4 positive cells in day
4 cultures. Moderate density cultures effectively formed definitive endoderm and 
progressed to express PDX1 in approximately 20% of the culture. High density
cultures contained approximately double the numbers of PDX1 positive pancreatic
progenitor cells and also showed increased expression of MNX1, PTF1a, NGN3, ARX, 
and PAX4 compared to cultures seeded at moderate density. The cultures seeded at 
high density displayed increased formation of polyhormonal pancreatic endocrine
cell populations co-expressing insulin, glucagon and somatostatin. The maturation
process giving rise to these endocrine cell populations followed the expected
cascade of pancreatic progenitor marker (PDX1 and MNX1) expression, followed by
pancreatic endocrine specification marker expression (BRN4, PAX4, ARX, NEUROD1,
NKX6.1 and NKX2.2) and then pancreatic hormone expression (insulin, glucagon and 
somatostatin). Taken together these data suggest that initial cell seeding
density plays an important role in both germ layer specification and pancreatic
progenitor commitment, which precedes pancreatic endocrine cell formation. This
work highlights the need to examine standard culture variables such as seeding
density when optimizing hESC differentiation protocols.

ARX/Arx is expressed in germ cells during spermatogenesis in both marsupial and
mouse.

(1)ARC Centre of Excellence for Kangaroo Genomics.

The X-linked aristaless gene, ARX, is essential for the development of the
gonads, forebrain, olfactory bulb, pancreas, and skeletal muscle in mice and
humans. Mutations cause neurological diseases, often accompanied by ambiguous
genitalia. There are a disproportionately high number of testis and brain genes
on the human and mouse X chromosomes. It is still unknown whether the X
chromosome accrued these genes during its evolution or whether genes that find
themselves on the X chromosome evolve such roles. ARX was originally autosomal in
mammals and remains so in marsupials, whereas in eutherian mammals it
translocated to the X chromosome. In this study, we examined autosomal ARX in
tammars and compared it with the X-linked Arx in mice. We detected ARX mRNA in
the neural cells of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain, and olfactory bulbs in
developing tammars, consistent with the expression in mice. ARX was detected by
RT-PCR and mRNA in situ hybridization in the developing tammar wallaby gonads of 
both sexes, suggestive of a role in sexual development as in mice. We also
detected ARX/Arx mRNA in the adult testis in both tammars and mice, suggesting a 
potential novel role for ARX/Arx in spermiogenesis. ARX transcripts were
predominantly observed in round spermatids. Arx mRNA localization distributions
in the mouse adult testis suggest that it escaped meiotic sex chromosome
inactivation during spermatogenesis. Our findings suggest that ARX in the therian
mammal ancestor already played a role in male reproduction before it was
recruited to the X chromosome in eutherians.

Arx polyalanine expansion in mice leads to reduced pancreatic a-cell
specification and increased a-cell death.

Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.

ARX/Arx is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor necessary for the
specification and early maintenance of pancreatic endocrine a-cells. Many
transcription factors important to pancreas development, including ARX/Arx, are
also crucial for proper brain development. Although null mutations of ARX in
human patients result in the severe neurologic syndrome XLAG (X-linked
lissencephaly associated with abnormal genitalia), the most common mutation is
the expansion of the first polyalanine tract of ARX, which results primarily in
the clinical syndrome ISSX (infantile spasms). Mouse models of XLAG, ISSX and
other human ARX mutations demonstrate a direct genotype-phenotype correlation in 
ARX-related neurologic disorders. Furthermore, mouse models utilizing a
polyalanine tract expansion mutation have illustrated critical developmental
differences between null mutations and expansion mutations in the brain,
revealing context-specific defects. Although Arx is known to be required for the 
specification and early maintenance of pancreatic glucagon-producing a-cells, the
consequences of the Arx polyalanine expansion on pancreas development remain
unknown. Here we report that mice with an expansion mutation in the first
polyalanine tract of Arx exhibit impaired a-cell specification and maintenance,
with gradual a-cell loss due to apoptosis. This is in contrast to the
re-specification of a-cells into ß- and d-cells that occurs in mice null for Arx.
Overall, our analysis of an Arx polyalanine expansion mutation on pancreatic
development suggests that impaired a-cell function might also occur in ISSX
patients.

Recently, it was demonstrated that pancreatic new-born glucagon-producing cells
can regenerate and convert into insulin-producing ß-like cells through the
ectopic expression of a single gene, Pax4. Here, combining conditional
loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches, we show that the selective
inhibition of the Arx gene in a-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of 
adult a-cells into ß-like cells at any age. Interestingly, this conversion
induces the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an
endocrine cell fate, the glucagon(+) cells thereby generated being subsequently
converted into ß-like cells upon Arx inhibition. Of interest, through the
generation and analysis of Arx and Pax4 conditional double-mutants, we provide
evidence that Pax4 is dispensable for these regeneration processes, indicating
that Arx represents the main trigger of a-cell-mediated ß-like cell neogenesis.
Importantly, the loss of Arx in a-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional 
ß-cell mass and thereby reverse diabetes following toxin-induced ß-cell
depletion. Our data therefore suggest that strategies aiming at inhibiting the
expression of Arx, or its molecular targets/co-factors, may pave new avenues for 
the treatment of diabetes.

The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in mammals is the main hypothalamic nucleus
controlling hormone release in the pituitary and plays pivotal roles in
homeostasis. While the location of a PVN-homologous region has been described in 
adult fish as the neurosecretory preoptic area (NPO), this region has not been
clearly defined in larval zebrafish due to the difficulty in defining
cytoarchitectonic nuclear boundaries in the larval brain. Here we identify the
precise location of the larval zebrafish NPO using conserved transcription factor
and neuropeptide gene expressions. Our results identify the dorsal half of the
preoptic-hypothalamic orthopedia a (otpa) domain as the larval NPO and the
homologous region to the mammalian PVN. Further, by reconstructing the locations 
of cells producing zebrafish neuropeptides found in the mammalian PVN (CCK, CRH, 
ENK, NTS, SS, VIP, OXT, AVP), we provide the first 3D arrangement map of NPO
neuropeptides in the larval zebrafish brain. Our results show striking
conservation of transcription factor expression (otp, arx, dlx5a, isl1) in and
around the NPO/PVN together with neuropeptide expression within it. Finally, we
describe the exact anatomical location of cells producing Oxt and Avp in the
adult zebrafish. Thus, our results identify the definitive borders and extent of 
the PVN homologous region in larval zebrafish and serve as an important basis for
cross-species comparisons of PVN/NPO structure and function.

Intellectual disability (ID) is a highly prevalent disorder that affects 1-3% of 
the population. The Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is a frequently
mutated X-linked ID gene and encodes a transcription factor indispensable for
proper forebrain, testis and pancreas development. Polyalanine expansions account
for over half of all mutations in ARX and clinically give rise to a spectrum of
ID and seizures. To understand how the polyalanine expansions cause the clinical 
phenotype, we studied mouse models of the two most frequent polyalanine expansion
mutations (Arx((GCG)7) and Arx(432-455dup24)). Neither model showed evidence of
protein aggregates; however, a marked reduction of Arx protein abundance within
the developing forebrain was striking. Examining the expression of known Arx
target genes, we found a more prominent loss of Lmo1 repression in Arx((GCG7)/Y) 
compared with Arx(432-455dup24/Y) mice at 12.5 and 14.5 dpc, stages of peak
neural proliferation and neurogenesis, respectively. Once neurogenesis concludes 
both mutant mouse models showed similar loss of Lmo1 repression. We propose that 
this temporal difference in the loss of Lmo1 repression may be one of the causes 
accounting for the phenotypic differences identified between the Arx((GCG)7)and
Arx(432-455dup24) mouse models. It is yet to be determined what effect these
mutations have on ARX protein in affected males in the human setting.

Characterization of the respiratory pattern variability of patients with
different pressure support levels.

Giraldo BF, Chaparro JA, Caminal P, Benito S.

One of the most challenging problems in intensive care is still the process of
discontinuing mechanical ventilation, called weaning process. Both an unnecessary
delay in the discontinuation process and a weaning trial that is undertaken too
early are undesirable. In this study, we analyzed respiratory pattern variability
using the respiratory volume signal of patients submitted to two different levels
of pressure support ventilation (PSV), prior to withdrawal of the mechanical
ventilation. In order to characterize the respiratory pattern, we analyzed the
following time series: inspiratory time, expiratory time, breath duration, tidal 
volume, fractional inspiratory time, mean inspiratory flow and rapid shallow
breathing. Several autoregressive modeling techniques were considered:
autoregressive models (AR), autoregressive moving average models (ARMA), and
autoregressive models with exogenous input (ARX). The following classification
methods were used: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
and support vector machines (SVM). 20 patients on weaning trials from mechanical 
ventilation were analyzed. The patients, submitted to two different levels of
PSV, were classified as low PSV and high PSV. The variability of the respiratory 
patterns of these patients were analyzed. The most relevant parameters were
extracted using the classifiers methods. The best results were obtained with the 
interquartile range and the final prediction errors of AR, ARMA and ARX models.
An accuracy of 95% (93% sensitivity and 90% specificity) was obtained when the
interquartile range of the expiratory time and the breath duration time series
were used a LDA model. All classifiers showed a good compromise between
sensitivity and specificity.

X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a common cause of moderate to severe
intellectual disability in males. XLMR protein related to neurite extension (Xpn,
also known as KIAA2022) has been implicated as a gene responsible for XLMR in
humans. Although Xpn is highly expressed in the developing brain and is involved 
in neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and neurons, little is known about the
functional role of Xpn. Here, we show that Xpn regulates cell-cell and
cell-matrix adhesion and migration in PC12 cells. Xpn knockdown enhanced
cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion mediated by N-cadherin and ß1-integrin,
respectively. N-Cadherin and ß1-integrin expression at the mRNA and protein
levels was significantly increased in Xpn knockdown PC12 cells. Furthermore,
overexpressed Xpn protein was strongly expressed in the nuclei of PC12 and 293T
cells. Finally, depletion of Xpn perturbed cellular migration by enhancing
N-cadherin and ß1-integrin expression in a PC12 cell wound healing assay. We
conclude that Xpn regulates cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and cellular
migration by regulating the expression of adhesion molecules.

Molecular depth profiling of organic thin films by erosion with energetic cluster
ion beams is a unique aspect of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
experiments. Although depth profiles of complex multilayer organic structures can
be acquired with little damage accumulation and with depth resolution of <10 nm
using either C60(+) or Arx(+) with x = 500-5000, hybrid materials consisting of
both organic and inorganic layers often yield poor results. To unravel the
factors that lead to this difficulty, we developed a model system composed of a
thin gold layer of 1.4 to 3.5 nm deposited either on top of or sandwiched within 
a cholesterol thin film matrix which is several hundred nanometers thick. For
these systems, the results show that by erosion with a 40 keV C60(+) beam,
reliable depth profiles can always be acquired as indicated by the presence of a 
steady state molecular ion signal. During the erosion process, however, gold
atoms from the gold overlayer are implanted into the cholesterol matrix beneath
it, resulting in a reduced sputter yield, an increase in the amount of
cholesterol fragmentation and an increase in the thickness of the cluster
ion-induced altered layer. The results also show that the effects of the metal
film on the organic substrate are independent of the gold film thickness once the
film thickness exceeds 1.4 nm. In general, this model study provides mechanistic 
insight into the depth profiling of heterogeneous thin film structures and offers
a possible path for improving the quality of the depth profiles by employing low 
energy atomic ion sputtering in the region of the metal layer.

The referenced quadrotor helicopter in this paper has a unique configuration. It 
is more complex than commonly used quadrotors because of its inaccurate
parameters, unideal symmetrical structure and unknown nonlinear dynamics. A novel
method was presented to handle its modeling and control problems in this paper,
which adopts a MIMO RBF neural nets-based state-dependent ARX (RBF-ARX) model to 
represent its nonlinear dynamics, and then a MIMO RBF-ARX model-based global LQR 
controller is proposed to stabilize the quadrotor's attitude. By comparing with a
physical model-based LQR controller and an ARX model-set-based gain scheduling
LQR controller, superiority of the MIMO RBF-ARX model-based control approach was 
confirmed. This successful application verified the validity of the MIMO RBF-ARX 
modeling method to the quadrotor helicopter with complex nonlinearity.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are found in a spectrum
of epilepsy and X-linked intellectual disability disorders. During development
Arx is expressed in pallial ventricular zone (VZ) progenitor cells where the
excitatory projection neurons of the cortex are born. Arx(-/Y) mice were shown to
have decreased proliferation in the cortical VZ resulting in smaller brains;
however, the basis for this reduced proliferation was not established. To
determine the role of ARX on cell cycle dynamics in cortical progenitor cells, we
generated cerebral cortex-specific Arx mouse mutants (cKO). The loss of pallial
Arx resulted in the reduction of cortical progenitor cells, particularly the
proliferation of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) was affected. Later in
development and postnatally cKO brains showed a reduction of upper layer but not 
deeper layer neurons consistent with the IPC defect. Transcriptional profile
analysis of E14.5 Arx-ablated cortices compared with control revealed that
CDKN1C, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, is overexpressed in the cortical 
VZ and SVZ of Arx KOs throughout corticogenesis. We also identified ARX as a
direct regulator of Cdkn1c transcription. Together these data support a model
where ARX regulates the expansion of cortical progenitor cells through repression
of Cdkn1c.

Pancreatic endocrine cells expand rapidly during embryogenesis by neogenesis and 
proliferation, but during adulthood, islet cells have a very slow turnover.
Disruption of murine retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) in mature
pancreatic ß-cells has a limited effect on cell proliferation. Here we show that 
deletion of Rb during embryogenesis in islet progenitors leads to an increase in 
the neurogenin 3-expressing precursor cell population, which persists in the
postnatal period and is associated with increased ß-cell mass in adults. In
contrast, Rb-deficient islet precursors, through repression of the cell fate
factor aristaless related homeobox, result in decreased a-cell mass. The opposing
effect on survival of Rb-deficient a- and ß-cells was a result of opposing
effects on p53 in these cell types. As a consequence, loss of Rb in islet
precursors led to a reduced a- to ß-cell ratio, leading to improved glucose
homeostasis and protection against diabetes.

Neurogenin3(+) (Ngn3(+)) progenitor cells in the developing pancreas give rise to
five endocrine cell types secreting insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic
polypeptide and ghrelin. Gastrin is a hormone produced primarily by G-cells in
the stomach, where it functions to stimulate acid secretion by gastric parietal
cells. Gastrin is expressed in the embryonic pancreas and is common in islet cell
tumors, but the lineage and regulators of pancreatic gastrin(+) cells are not
known. We report that gastrin is abundantly expressed in the embryonic pancreas
and disappears soon after birth. Some gastrin(+) cells in the developing pancreas
co-express glucagon, ghrelin or pancreatic polypeptide, but many gastrin(+) cells
do not express any other islet hormone. Pancreatic gastrin(+) cells express the
transcription factors Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2 and low levels of Pdx1, and derive from
Ngn3(+) endocrine progenitor cells as shown by genetic lineage tracing. Using
mice deficient for key transcription factors we show that gastrin expression
depends on Ngn3, Nkx2.2, NeuroD1 and Arx, but not Pax4 or Pax6. Finally, gastrin 
expression is induced upon differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to
pancreatic endocrine cells expressing insulin. Thus, gastrin(+) cells are a
distinct endocrine cell type in the pancreas and an alternative fate of Ngn3+
cells.

West syndrome is a well-recognized form of epilepsy, defined by a triad of
infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia and developmental arrest. West syndrome is
heterogenous, caused by mutations of genes ARX, STXBP1, KCNT1 among others;
16p13.11 and 17q21.31 microdeletions are less frequent, usually associated with
intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism. So-called "idiopathic" West
syndrome is of better prognostic, without prior intellectual deficiency and
usually responsive to anti-epileptic treatment. We report on a boy falling within
the scope of idiopathic West syndrome, with no dysmorphic features and normal
development before the beginning of West syndrome, with a good resolution after
treatment, bearing a de novo 15q13.3 microdeletion. Six genes are located in the 
deleted region, including CHRNA7, which encodes a subunit of a nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor, and is frequently associated with epilepsy. Exploration
of the 15q13.3 region should be proposed in idiopathic West syndrome.

Development and validation of a multiplex-PCR assay for X-linked intellectual
disability.

BACKGROUND: X-linked intellectual disability is a common cause of inherited
cognitive deficit affecting mostly males. There are several genetic causes
implicated in this condition, which has hampered the establishment of an accurate
diagnosis. We developed a multiplex-PCR assay for the mutational hotspot regions 
of the FMR1, AFF2 and ARX genes.
METHODS: The multiplex-PCR was validated in a cohort of 100 males selected to
include known alleles for the FMR1 repetitive region: five full mutations
(250-650 CGGs), ten premutations (70-165 CGGs) and eighty-five in the normal
range (19-42 CGGs). Sequencing or Southern blotting was used to confirm the
results, depending on the allele class. In this cohort, with the exception of one
sample showing an AFF2 intermediate-sized allele, all other samples were normal
(8-34 CCGs). No ARX variant was found besides the c.429_452dup. The validated
assay was applied to 5000 samples (64.4% males and 35.6% females).
RESULTS: The normal-allelic range of both FMR1 and AFF2 genes as well as the
nature of ARX variants identified was similar in both genders. The rate of
homozygosity observed in female samples, 27.5% for FMR1 and 17.8% for AFF2
alleles, is comparable to that published by others. Two FMR1 premutations were
identified, in a male (58 CGGs) and a female case [(CGG)(47)/(CGG)(61)], as well 
as several FMR1 or AFF2 intermediate-sized alleles. One AFF2 premutation (68
CCGs) and two putative full expansions were picked up in male subjects, which
seems relevant considering the rarity of reported AFF2 mutations found in the
absence of a family history.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a robust multiplex-PCR that can be used to screen the
mutational hotspot regions of FMR1, AFF2 and ARX genes. Moreover, this strategy
led to the identification of variants in all three genes, representing not only
an improvement in allele-sizing but also in achieving a differential diagnosis.
Although the distinction between females who are truly homozygous and those with 
a second pre- or full mutation sized allele, as well as a definitive diagnosis,
requires a specific downstream technique, the use of this multiplex-PCR for
initial screening is a cost-effective approach which widens the scope of
detection.

Developmental biology is challenged to reveal the function of numerous candidate 
genes implicated by recent genome-scale studies as regulators of organ
development and diseases. Recapitulating organogenesis from purified progenitor
cells that can be genetically manipulated would provide powerful opportunities to
dissect such gene functions. Here we describe systems for reconstructing pancreas
development, including islet ß-cell and a-cell differentiation, from single fetal
progenitor cells. A strict requirement for native genetic regulators of in vivo
pancreas development, such as Ngn3, Arx, and Pax4, revealed the authenticity of
differentiation programs in vitro. Efficient genetic screens permitted by this
system revealed that Prdm16 is required for pancreatic islet development in vivo.
Discovering the function of genes regulating pancreas development with our system
should enrich strategies for regenerating islets for treating diabetes mellitus.

Aristaless related homeobox gene, Arx, is implicated in mouse fetal Leydig cell
differentiation possibly through expressing in the progenitor cells.

Development of the testis begins with the expression of the SRY gene in
pre-Sertoli cells. Soon after, testis cords containing Sertoli and germ cells are
formed and fetal Leydig cells subsequently develop in the interstitial space.
Studies using knockout mice have indicated that multiple genes encoding growth
factors and transcription factors are implicated in fetal Leydig cell
differentiation. Previously, we demonstrated that the Arx gene is implicated in
this process. However, how ARX regulates Leydig cell differentiation remained
unknown. In this study, we examined Arx KO testes and revealed that fetal Leydig 
cell numbers largely decrease throughout the fetal life. Since our study shows
that fetal Leydig cells rarely proliferate, this decrease in the KO testes is
thought to be due to defects of fetal Leydig progenitor cells. In sexually
indifferent fetal gonads of wild type, ARX was expressed in the coelomic
epithelial cells and cells underneath the epithelium as well as cells at the
gonad-mesonephros border, both of which have been described to contain
progenitors of fetal Leydig cells. After testis differentiation, ARX was
expressed in a large population of the interstitial cells but not in fetal Leydig
cells, raising the possibility that ARX-positive cells contain fetal Leydig
progenitor cells. When examining marker gene expression, we observed cells as if 
they were differentiating into fetal Leydig cells from the progenitor cells.
Based on these results, we propose that ARX acts as a positive factor for
differentiation of fetal Leydig cells through functioning at the progenitor
stage.

Pancreatic a-cell specific deletion of mouse Arx leads to a-cell identity loss.

Author information:

Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.

The specification and differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cell populations
(a-, ß-, d, PP- and e-cells) is orchestrated by a combination of transcriptional 
regulators. In the pancreas, Aristaless-related homeobox gene (Arx) is expressed 
first in the endocrine progenitors and then restricted to glucagon-producing
a-cells. While the functional requirement of Arx in early a-cell specification
has been investigated, its role in maintaining a-cell identity has yet to be
explored. To study this later role of Arx, we have generated mice in which the
Arx gene has been ablated specifically in glucagon-producing a-cells.
Lineage-tracing studies and immunostaining analysis for endocrine hormones
demonstrate that ablation of Arx in neonatal a-cells results in an a-to-ß-like
conversion through an intermediate bihormonal state. Furthermore, these
Arx-deficient converted cells express ß-cell markers including Pdx1, MafA, and
Glut2. Surprisingly, short-term ablation of Arx in adult mice does not result in 
a similar a-to-ß-like conversion. Taken together, these findings reveal a
potential temporal requirement for Arx in maintaining a-cell identity.

Nuclear import of aristaless-related homeobox protein via its NLS1 regulates its 
transcriptional function.

Nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcription factors is essential in eukaryotes. 
We previously reported the presence of two functional NLSs in the homeodomain
protein, aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) protein, which is a key
transcriptional repressor of LMO1, SHOX2, and PAX4 during development. NLS2, that
overlaps the homeodomain, is recognized directly by multiple importin ßs, but not
by importin as. In this study, we found that the N-terminal NLS1 of Arx is
targeted by multiple importin a proteins, including importin a3 and a5. Both in
vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that nuclear import of Arx via NLS1 is
mediated by the importin a/ß pathway. Mutagenesis analysis indicated that two
basic amino acids, (84)K and (87)R, are essential to the function of NLS1, and
that their mutation prevents interactions of Arx with importin as. Interestingly,
inhibition of nuclear import of Arx via NLS1 clearly attenuates its ability of
transcriptional repression, suggesting that nuclear import of Arx via NLS1
contributes to its transcriptional function.

adaptive prediction models.

Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 50, Bern, Switzerland.

INTRODUCTION: Early warning of future hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events can
improve the safety of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. The aim of this
study is to design and evaluate a hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia early warning system
(EWS) for T1DM patients under sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy.
METHODS: The EWS is based on the combination of data-driven online adaptive
prediction models and a warning algorithm. Three modeling approaches have been
investigated: (i) autoregressive (ARX) models, (ii) auto-regressive with an
output correction module (cARX) models, and (iii) recurrent neural network (RNN) 
models. The warning algorithm performs postprocessing of the models' outputs and 
issues alerts if upcoming hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events are detected. Fusion 
of the cARX and RNN models, due to their complementary prediction performances,
resulted in the hybrid autoregressive with an output correction module/recurrent 
neural network (cARN)-based EWS.
RESULTS: The EWS was evaluated on 23 T1DM patients under SAP therapy. The
ARX-based system achieved hypoglycemic (hyperglycemic) event prediction with
median values of accuracy of 100.0% (100.0%), detection time of 10.0 (8.0) min,
and daily false alarms of 0.7 (0.5). The respective values for the cARX-based
system were 100.0% (100.0%), 17.5 (14.8) min, and 1.5 (1.3) and, for the
RNN-based system, were 100.0% (92.0%), 8.4 (7.0) min, and 0.1 (0.2). The hybrid
cARN-based EWS presented outperforming results with 100.0% (100.0%) prediction
accuracy, detection 16.7 (14.7) min in advance, and 0.8 (0.8) daily false alarms.
CONCLUSION: Combined use of cARX and RNN models for the development of an EWS
outperformed the single use of each model, achieving accurate and prompt event
prediction with few false alarms, thus providing increased safety and comfort.

Identification of the feedforward component in manual control with predictable
target signals.

Drop FM, Pool DM, Damveld HJ, van Paassen MM, Mulder M.

In the manual control of a dynamic system, the human controller (HC) often
follows a visible and predictable reference path. Compared with a purely feedback
control strategy, performance can be improved by making use of this knowledge of 
the reference. The operator could effectively introduce feedforward control in
conjunction with a feedback path to compensate for errors, as hypothesized in
literature. However, feedforward behavior has never been identified from
experimental data, nor have the hypothesized models been validated. This paper
investigates human control behavior in pursuit tracking of a predictable
reference signal while being perturbed by a quasi-random multisine disturbance
signal. An experiment was done in which the relative strength of the target and
disturbance signals were systematically varied. The anticipated changes in
control behavior were studied by means of an ARX model analysis and by fitting
three parametric HC models: two different feedback models and a combined
feedforward and feedback model. The ARX analysis shows that the experiment
participants employed control action on both the error and the target signal. The
control action on the target was similar to the inverse of the system dynamics.
Model fits show that this behavior can be modeled best by the combined
feedforward and feedback model.

interactions of proteins containing "sticky" polyalanine (PolyA) tracts

Aristaless-related homeobox plays a key role in hyperplasia of the pancreas islet
a-like cells in mice deficient in proglucagon-derived peptides.

Defects in glucagon action can cause hyperplasia of islet a-cells, however, the
underlying mechanisms remain largely to be elucidated. Mice homozygous for a
glucagon-GFP knock-in allele (Gcg(gfp/gfp) ) completely lack proglucagon-derived 
peptides and exhibit hyperplasia of GFP-positive a-like cells. Expression of the 
transcription factor, aristaless-related homeobox (ARX), is also increased in the
Gcg(gfp/gfp) pancreas. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of ARX in the
hyperplasia of a-like cells through analyses of two Arx mutant alleles
(Arx(P355L/Y) and Arx ([330insGCG]7/Y) ) that have different levels of impairment
of their function. Expression of Gfp and Arx genes was higher and the size and
number of islets increased in the Gcg(gfp/gfp) pancreas compared to and
Gcg(gfp/+) pancreas at 2 weeks of age. In male Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice that are
hemizygous for the Arx(P355L/Y) mutation that results in a protein with a P355L
amino acid substitution, expression of Gfp mRNA in the pancreas was comparable to
that in control Gcg(gfp/+)Arx(+/Y) mice. The increases in islet size and number
were also reduced in these mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the
number of GFP-positive cells was comparable in Gcg(gfp/gfp) Arx(P355L/Y) and
Gcg(gfp/+)Arx(+/Y) mice. These results indicate that the hyperplasia is reduced
by introduction of an Arx mutation. Arx(P355L/Y) mice appeared to be
phenotypically normal; however, Arx ([330insGCG]7/Y) mice that have a mutant ARX 
protein with expansion of the polyalanine tract had a reduced body size and
shortened life span. The number of GFP positive cells was further reduced in the 
Gcg(gfp/gfp) Arx ([330insGCG]7/Y) mice. Taken together, our findings show that
the function of ARX is one of the key modifiers for hyperplasia of islet a-like
cells in the absence of proglucagon-derived peptides.

The antimicrobial effects of the wood-associated polyphenolic compounds
pinosylvin, pinosylvin monomethyl ether, astringin, piceatannol, isorhapontin,
isorhapontigenin, cycloXMe, dHIMP, ArX, and ArXOH were assessed against both
Gram-negative (Salmonella) and Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes,
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus) and yeasts (Candida
tropicalis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Particularly the stilbenes pinosylvin, its
monomethyl ether and piceatannol demonstrated a clear antimicrobial activity,
which in the case of pinosylvin was present also in food matrices like
sauerkraut, gravlax and berry jam, but not in milk. The destabilization of the
outer membrane of Gram-negative microorganisms, as well as interactions with the 
cell membrane, as indicated by the NPN uptake and LIVE/DEAD viability staining
experiments, can be one of the specific mechanisms behind the antibacterial
action. L. monocytogenes was particularly sensitive to pinosylvin, and this
effect was also seen in L. monocytogenes internalized in intestinal Caco2 cells
at non-cytotoxic pinosylvin concentrations. In general, the antimicrobial effects
of pinosylvin were even more prominent than those of a related stilbene,
resveratrol, well known for its various bioactivities. According to our results, 
pinosylvin could have potential as a natural disinfectant or biocide in some
targeted applications.

Bursts of paroxysmal activity alternating with lack of activity define the
suppression-burst (SB) pattern that may be acute, in hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy and barbiturate intoxication, or chronic in the course of early
epileptic and neonatal myoclonic (NME) encephalopathies. Malformations, namely
Aicardi syndrome and hemimegalencephaly, gene mutations - of ARX and MUNC18 -,
and inborn errors of metabolism, namely glycine encephalopathy, are the main
causes, with spasms indicating more likely a malformation whereas myoclonus
indicates metabolic disorders. Although glycine encephalopathy has a very severe 
outcome in its classical expression, it may be transient in the neonatal period, 
for reasons yet not identified. Although glycine encephalopathy is the main
identified cause of NME, the disorder may not cause SB, especially in cases with 
later onset. The biochemical bases, due to changes in one of the four proteins
that compose the enzyme, are well understood, but there is no phenotype-genotype 
correlation. Prenatal diagnosis is based on villous biopsy. The mechanism of SB
partly depends on glutamate - or glycine, the co-neurotransmitter for NMDA
transmission - overflow, mainly in the immature brain but also in cases due to
barbiturate intoxication. Energy supply defect may also be involved in some
inborn errors of metabolism.

Diffuse malformations of cortical development.

Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of
developmental disabilities and severe epilepsy. Advances in imaging and genetics 
have improved the diagnosis and classification of these conditions. Up to now,
eight genes have been involved in different types of MCD.
Lissencephaly-pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) represent a
malformative spectrum resulting from mutations of either LIS1 or DCX genes. LIS1 
mutations cause a more severe malformation in the posterior brain regions. DCX
mutations usually cause anteriorly predominant lissencephaly in males and SBH in 
female patients. Additional forms are X-linked lissencephaly with corpus callosum
agenesis and ambiguous genitalia associated with mutations of the ARX gene.
Lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH) encompass heterogeneous disorders 
named LCH types a to d. LCHa is related to mutation in LIS1 or DCX, LCHb with
mutation of the RELN gene, and LCHd could be related to the TUBA1A gene.
Polymicrogyria encompasses a wide range of clinical, etiological, and
histological findings. Among several syndromes, recessive bilateral
fronto-parietal polymicrogyria has been associated with mutations of the GPR56
gene. Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria has been associated with mutations in 
the SRPX2 gene in a few individuals and with linkage to chromosome Xq28 in a some
other families. X-linked bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH)
consists of PNH with focal epilepsy in females and prenatal lethality in males.
Filamin A (FLNA) mutations have been reported in some families and in sporadic
patients. It is possible to infer the most likely causative gene by brain imaging
studies and other clinical findings.

Ten percent of cases of intellectual deficiency in boys are caused by genes
located on the X chromosome. X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) includes more
than 200 syndromes and 80 genes identified to date. The fragile X syndrome is the
most frequent syndrome, due to a dynamic mutation with a CGG triplet
amplification. Mental retardation is virtually always present. Phonological and
syntactic impairments are often combined with pragmatic language impairment and
visuospatial reasoning difficulties. A minority fulfill the criteria for autism. 
In girls, the clinical expression of the complete mutation varies according to
the X chromosome inactivation profile. Several XLMR occur as severe early onset
encephalopathies: Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, ATR-X syndrome (alpha
thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked), Allan-Herdon-Dudley syndrome (MCT8
gene). Two genes, ARX (X-LAG; Partington syndrome) and MECP2 (Rett syndrome in
females; mild MR with spastic diplegia/psychotic problems in males) are
associated with various phenotypes, according to the mutation involved.
Oligophrenine 1 (OPHN-1) gene mutations lead to vermal dysplasia. PQBP1 gene
mutations (Renpenning syndrome) are responsible for moderate to severe mental
deficiency, microcephaly, and small stature. Although some forms of XLMR are not 
very specific and the phenotype for each given gene is somewhat heterogeneous, a 
clinical diagnostic strategy is emerging.

Identification of DCX gene mutation in lissencephaly spectrum with subcortical
band heterotopia using whole exome sequencing.

Malformations of cortical development include a wide range of brain developmental
anomalies that commonly lead to developmental delay and epilepsy. Lissencephaly
and subcortical band heterotopia are major malformations of cortical development 
due to abnormal neuronal migration and several genes have been identified
including ARX, DCX, LIS1, RELN, TUBA1A, and VLDLR. Traditionally, genetic testing
for lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia has been done in the order of 
the probability of detection of mutation according to the radiologic features,
but the success rate could be variable with this time-consuming approach. In this
study we used whole-exome sequencing to identify mutations in a 5-year-old girl
with lissencephaly spectrum with subcortical band heterotopia. After excluding
lissencephaly-related genes, one deleterious mutation (NM_178153.2:c.665C > T,
p.Thr222Ile) in the DCX gene was identified. Further Sanger sequencing validated 
the variant in the patient but not in both parents indicating a de novo mutation.
The present report demonstrates that whole-exome sequencing may be a useful tool 
for the identification of mutations in patients with lissencephaly and
subcortical band heterotopias as well as malformations of cortical development.

Mutations in CDKL5 and ARX are known causes of early-onset epilepsy and severe
developmental delay in males and females. Although numerous males with ARX
mutations associated with various phenotypes have been reported in the
literature, the majority of CDKL5 mutations have been identified in females with 
a phenotype characterized by early-onset epilepsy, severe global developmental
delay, absent speech, and stereotypic hand movements. To date, only 10 males with
CDKL5 mutations have been reported. Our retrospective study reports on the
clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular findings of 18 males with early-onset
epilepsy caused by either CDKL5 or ARX mutations. These 18 patients include eight
new males with CDKL5 mutations and 10 with ARX mutations identified through
sequence analysis of 266 and 346 males, respectively, at our molecular diagnostic
laboratory. Our large dataset therefore expands on the number of reported males
with CDKL5 mutations and highlights that aberrations of CDKL5 and ARX combined
are an important consideration in the genetic forms of early-onset epilepsy in
boys.

Conversion of one terminally differentiated cell type into another (or
transdifferentiation) usually requires the forced expression of key transcription
factors. We examined the plasticity of human insulin-producing ß-cells in a model
of islet cell aggregate formation. Here, we show that primary human ß-cells can
undergo a conversion into glucagon-producing a-cells without introduction of any 
genetic modification. The process occurs within days as revealed by
lentivirus-mediated ß-cell lineage tracing. Converted cells are indistinguishable
from native a-cells based on ultrastructural morphology and maintain their a-cell
phenotype after transplantation in vivo. Transition of ß-cells into a-cells
occurs after ß-cell degranulation and is characterized by the presence of
ß-cell-specific transcription factors Pdx1 and Nkx6.1 in glucagon(+) cells.
Finally, we show that lentivirus-mediated knockdown of Arx, a determinant of the 
a-cell lineage, inhibits the conversion. Our findings reveal an unknown
plasticity of human adult endocrine cells that can be modulated. This endocrine
cell plasticity could have implications for islet development, (patho)physiology,
and regeneration.

The authors describe 2 patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy
caused by 2 novel mutations involving the STXBP1 gene. The authors suggest that
in spite of the rarity of STXBP1 mutations, molecular analysis of STXBP1 gene
should be performed in patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy,
after exclusion of ARX mutations in male patients and CDKL5 mutations in female
patients. The potential mechanisms explaining the variable clinical phenotypes
caused by STXBP1 mutations are discussed and the designation of early-onset
epileptic encephalopathies, including an updated genetic classification, is
proposed to encompass the epileptic encephalopathies beginning in the first 6
months of life.

An efficient synthesis of aryl carbamates was achieved by introducing alcohols
into the reaction of palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of ArX (X = Cl, OTf) with
sodium cyanate. The use of aryl triflates as electrophilic components in this
transformation allowed for an expanded substrate scope for direct synthesis of
aryl isocyanates. This methodology provides direct access to major carbamate
protecting groups, S-thiocarbamates, and diisocyanate precursors to polyurethane 
materials.

Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies include various diseases such as
early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst. We
experimentally investigated the unique clinicopathological features of a
28-month-old girl with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Her initial symptom 
was intractable epilepsy with a suppression-burst pattern of
electroencephalography (EEG) from 7 days of age. The suppression-burst pattern
was novel, appearing during sleep, but disappearing upon waking and after
becoming 2 months old. The EEG showed multifocal spikes and altered with age. Her
seizures demonstrated various clinical features and continued until death. She
did not show any developmental features, including no social smiling or head
control. Head MRI revealed progressive atrophy of the cerebral cortex and white
matter after 1 month of age. (123)IMZ-SPECT demonstrated hypo-perfusion of the
cerebral cortex, but normo-perfusion of the diencephalon and cerebellum. Such
imaging information indicated GABA-A receptor dysfunction of the cerebral cortex.
The genetic analyses of major neonatal epilepsies showed no mutation. The
neuropathology revealed atrophy and severe edema of the cerebral cortex and white
matter. GAD-immunohistochemistry exhibited imbalanced distribution of GABAergic
interneurons between the striatum and cerebral cortex. The results were similar
to those of focal cortical dysplasia with transmantle sign and X-linked
lissencephaly with ARX mutation. We performed various metabolic examinations,
detailed pathological investigations and genetic analyses, but could not identify
the cause. To our knowledge, her clinical and pathological courses have never
been described in the literature.

BACKGROUND: Banana anthracnose incited by Colletotrichum musae (Berk & Curt.)
Arx. is a serious disease both in field and in postharvest marketing stage.
Molecular methods are most suitable for the early detection of infection. AIM:
The latent infection of C. musae makes it very difficult to detect the infected
fruit lot, hence aim is to detect the latent infection using molecular approach. 
METHODS: The molecular variability generated from fourteen isolates of C. musae
by RAPD-PCR technique was utilized to determine the phylogentic relationship and 
develop SCAR markers. RESULTS: The genetic similarity coefficient within each
group and variation between the groups were observed. Decamer OPA-01 generated a 
RAPD polymorphic profile that distinguished C. musae from the other organism.
Cloning and sequencing of the specific band yielded 588bp sequences, to which
forward CM-SCAR-FP and reverse CM-SCAR-RP were designed. The SCAR primer pair
amplified a single SCAR of 490bp from each of the 14 isolates of C. musae, and
was able to detect the pathogen in as low as 30ng of DNA from infected fruit peel
tissue. CONCLUSION: The developed SCAR markers can aid the detection process
every quickly and accurately which will help exporters.

MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome is an emerging neurodevelopmental disorder
associated with intellectual disability, autistic features, epilepsy, and
abnormal movements. We report 16 new patients with MEF2C haploinsufficiency,
including the oldest reported patient with MEF2C deletion at 5q14.3. We detail
the neurobehavioral phenotype, epilepsy, and abnormal movements, and compare our 
subjects with those previously reported in the literature. We also investigate
Mef2c expression in the developing mouse forebrain. A spectrum of neurofunctional
deficits emerges, with hyperkinesis a consistent finding. Epilepsy varied from
absent to severe, and included intractable myoclonic seizures and infantile
spasms. Subjects with partial MEF2C deletion were statistically less likely to
have epilepsy. Finally, we confirm that Mef2c is present both in dorsal primary
neuroblasts and ventral gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)ergic interneurons in the
forebrain of the developing mouse. Given interactions with several key
neurodevelopmental genes such as ARX, FMR1, MECP2, and TBR1, it appears that
MEF2C plays a role in several developmental stages of both dorsal and ventral
neuronal cell types.

All pancreatic endocrine cell types arise from a common endocrine precursor cell 
population, yet the molecular mechanisms that establish and maintain the unique
gene expression programs of each endocrine cell lineage have remained largely
elusive. Such knowledge would improve our ability to correctly program or
reprogram cells to adopt specific endocrine fates. Here, we show that the
transcription factor Nkx6.1 is both necessary and sufficient to specify
insulin-producing beta cells. Heritable expression of Nkx6.1 in endocrine
precursors of mice is sufficient to respecify non-beta endocrine precursors
towards the beta cell lineage, while endocrine precursor- or beta cell-specific
inactivation of Nkx6.1 converts beta cells to alternative endocrine lineages.
Remaining insulin(+) cells in conditional Nkx6.1 mutants fail to express the beta
cell transcription factors Pdx1 and MafA and ectopically express genes found in
non-beta endocrine cells. By showing that Nkx6.1 binds to and represses the alpha
cell determinant Arx, we identify Arx as a direct target of Nkx6.1. Moreover, we 
demonstrate that Nkx6.1 and the Arx activator Isl1 regulate Arx transcription
antagonistically, thus establishing competition between Isl1 and Nkx6.1 as a
critical mechanism for determining alpha versus beta cell identity. Our findings 
establish Nkx6.1 as a beta cell programming factor and demonstrate that
repression of alternative lineage programs is a fundamental principle by which
beta cells are specified and maintained. Given the lack of Nkx6.1 expression and 
aberrant activation of non-beta endocrine hormones in human embryonic stem cell
(hESC)-derived insulin(+) cells, our study has significant implications for
developing cell replacement therapies.

Extracting the directional interaction between activated brain areas from
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series measurements of their
activity is a significant step in understanding the process of brain functions.
In this paper, the directional interaction between fMRI time series
characterizing the activity of two neuronal sites is quantified using two
measures; one derived based on univariate autoregressive and autoregressive
exogenous (AR/ARX) and other derived based on multivariate vector autoregressive 
and vector autoregressive exogenous (VAR/VARX) models. The significance and
effectiveness of these measures is illustrated on both simulated and real fMRI
data sets. It has been revealed that VAR modelling of the regions of interest is 
robust in inferring true causality compared to principal component analysis (PCA)
and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based causality methods.

Weaning trials process of patients in intensive care units is a complex clinical 
procedure. 153 patients under extubation process (T-tube test) were studied: 94
patients with successful trials (group S), 38 patients who failed to maintain
spontaneous breathing and were reconnected (group F), and 21 patients with
successful test but that had to be reintubated before 48 hours (group R). The
respiratory pattern of each patient was characterized through the following time 
series: inspiratory time (T(I)), expiratory time (T(E)), breathing cycle duration
(T(Tot)), tidal volume (V(T)), inspiratory fraction (T(I)/T(Tot)), half inspired 
flow (V(T)/T(I)), and rapid shallow index (f/V(T)), where  is respiratory rate. 
Using techniques as autoregressive models (AR), autoregressive moving average
models (ARMA) and autoregressive models with exogenous input (ARX), the most
relevant parameters of the respiratory pattern were obtained. We proposed the
evaluation of these parameters using classifiers as logistic regression (LR),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and
classification and regression tree (CART) to discriminate between patients from
groups S, F and R. An accuracy of 93% (98% sensitivity and 82% specificity) has
been obtained using CART classification.

Parameterized phase response curves for characterizing neuronal behaviors under
transient conditions.

Miranda-Domínguez Ó(1), Netoff TI.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities,
Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

Phase response curves (PRCs) are a simple model of how a neuron's spike time is
affected by synaptic inputs. PRCs are useful in predicting how networks of
neurons behave when connected. One challenge in estimating a neuron's PRCs
experimentally is that many neurons do not have stationary firing rates. In this 
article we introduce a new method to estimate PRCs as a function of firing rate
of the neuron. We call the resulting model a parameterized PRC (pPRC).
Experimentally, we perturb the neuron applying a current with two parts: 1) a
current held constant between spikes but changed at the onset of a spike, used to
make the neuron fire at different rates, and 2) a pulse to emulate a synaptic
input. A model of the applied constant current and the history is made to predict
the interspike interval (ISI). A second model is then made to fit the modulation 
of the spike time from the expected ISI by the pulsatile stimulus. A polynomial
with two independent variables, the stimulus phase and the expected ISI, is used 
to model the pPRC. The pPRC is validated in a computational model and applied to 
pyramidal neurons from the CA1 region of the hippocampal slices from rat. The
pPRC can be used to model the effect of changing firing rates on network
synchrony. It can also be used to characterize the effects of neuromodulators and
genetic mutations (among other manipulations) on network synchrony. It can also
easily be extended to account for more variables.

Infantile spasms are age-specific seizures of infantile epileptic
encephalopathies that are usually associated with poor epilepsy and
neurodevelopmental outcomes. The current treatments are not always effective and 
may be associated with significant side effects. Various mechanisms have been
proposed as pathogenic for infantile spasms, including cortical or brainstem
dysfunction, disruption of normal cortical-subcortical communications, genetic
defects, inflammation, stress, developmental abnormalities. Many of these have
been recently tested experimentally, resulting into the emergence of several
animal models of infantile spasms. The stress theory of spasms yielded the
corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-induced model, which showed the higher
proconvulsant potency of CRH in developing rats, although only limbic seizures
were observed. Models of acute induction of infantile spasms in rodents include
the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) model of emprosthotonic seizures, the prenatal
betamethasone and prenatal stress variants of the NMDA model, and the
<U+03B3>-butyrolactone induced spasms in a Down's syndrome mouse model. Chronic rodent
models of infantile spasms include the tetrodotoxin model and the multiple-hit
models in rats, as well as two genetic mouse models of interneuronopathies with
infantile spasms due to loss of function of the aristaless X-linked
homeobox-related gene (ARX). This review discusses the emerging mechanisms for
generation of infantile spasms and their associated chronic epileptic and
dyscognitive phenotype as well as the recent progress in identifying pathways to 
better treat this epileptic encephalopathy.

The alpha cells that coinhabit the islets with the insulin-producing beta cells
have recently captured the attention of diabetes researchers because of new
breakthrough findings highlighting the importance of these cells in the
maintenance of beta cell health and functions. In normal physiological conditions
alpha cells produce glucagon but in conditions of beta cell injury they also
produce glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a growth and survival factor for beta
cells. In this review we consider these new findings on the functions of alpha
cells. Alpha cells remain somewhat enigmatic inasmuch as they now appear to be
important in the maintenance of the health of beta cells, but their production of
glucagon promotes diabetes. This circumstance prompts an examination of
approaches to coax alpha cells to produce GLP-1 instead of glucagon.

Genetic testing of epileptic encephalopathies of infancy: an approach.

Sharma S(1), Prasad AN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.

The epileptic encephalopathies of infancy are a group of disorders characterized 
by intractable seizures, persistent abnormality of cortical function documented
on EEG, and consequently impaired neuro-developmental outcomes. The etiologies
vary and include; structural brain malformations, acquired brain insults, and
inborn errors of metabolism in the majority of the affected patients. In a
proportion of these cases no obvious etiology is identifiable on investigation.
Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have led to the discovery of a number of
gene defects that may be causal in many epileptic encephalopathies.
Identification of the causative mutation is important for prognostic and genetic 
counseling, and may also carry treatment implications. The recently described
genes include; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-Like 5 gene (CDKL5), Protocadherin 19
(PCDH19), Sodium channel neuronal type 1a subunit gene (SCN1A),
Aristaless-Related Homeobox Gene (ARX), and Syntaxin binding protein 1 gene
(STXBP1), amongst others. Distinct electro-clinical syndromes are increasingly
being identified amongst patients carrying the various mutations. In this review,

Intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy often occur together and have a
dramatic impact on the development and quality of life of the affected children. 
Polyalanine (polyA)-expansion-encoding mutations of aristaless-related homeobox
(ARX) cause a spectrum of X-linked ID (XLID) diseases and chronic epilepsy,
including infantile spasms. We show that lysine-specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C), 
a gene known to be mutated in XLID-affected children and involved in chromatin
remodeling, is directly regulated by ARX through the binding in a conserved
noncoding element. We have studied altered ARX carrying various polyA elongations
in individuals with XLID and/or epilepsy. The changes in polyA repeats cause
hypomorphic ARX alterations, which exhibit a decreased trans-activity and
reduced, but not abolished, binding to the KDM5C regulatory region. The altered
functioning of the mutants tested is likely to correlate with the severity of
XLID and/or epilepsy. By quantitative RT-PCR, we observed a dramatic Kdm5c mRNA
downregulation in murine Arx-knockout embryonic and neural stem cells. Such Kdm5c
mRNA diminution led to a severe decrease in the KDM5C content during in vitro
neuronal differentiation, which inversely correlated with an increase in H3K4me3 
signal. We established that ARX polyA alterations damage the regulation of KDM5C 
expression, and we propose a potential ARX-dependent path acting via chromatin
remodeling.

Pax4 is not essential for beta-cell differentiation in zebrafish embryos but
modulates alpha-cell generation by repressing arx gene expression.

BACKGROUND: Genetic studies in mouse have demonstrated the crucial function of
PAX4 in pancreatic cell differentiation. This transcription factor specifies ß-
and d-cell fate at the expense of a-cell identity by repressing Arx gene
expression and ectopic expression of PAX4 in a-cells is sufficient to convert
them into ß-cells. Surprisingly, no Pax4 orthologous gene can be found in chicken
and Xenopus tropicalis raising the question of the function of pax4 gene in lower
vertebrates such as in fish. In the present study, we have analyzed the
expression and the function of the orthologous pax4 gene in zebrafish.
RESULTS: pax4 gene is transiently expressed in the pancreas of zebrafish embryos 
and is mostly restricted to endocrine precursors as well as to some
differentiating d- and e-cells but was not detected in differentiating ß-cells.
pax4 knock-down in zebrafish embryos caused a significant increase in a-cells
number while having no apparent effect on ß- and d-cell differentiation. This
rise of a-cells is due to an up-regulation of the Arx transcription factor.
Conversely, knock-down of arx caused to a complete loss of a-cells and a
concomitant increase of pax4 expression but had no effect on the number of ß- and
d-cells. In addition to the mutual repression between Arx and Pax4, these two
transcription factors negatively regulate the transcription of their own gene.
Interestingly, disruption of pax4 RNA splicing or of arx RNA splicing by
morpholinos targeting exon-intron junction sites caused a blockage of the altered
transcripts in cell nuclei allowing an easy characterization of the arx- and
pax4-deficient cells. Such analyses demonstrated that arx knock-down in zebrafish
does not lead to a switch of cell fate, as reported in mouse, but rather blocks
the cells in their differentiation process towards a-cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In zebrafish, pax4 is not required for the generation of the first
ß- and d-cells deriving from the dorsal pancreatic bud, unlike its crucial role
in the differentiation of these cell types in mouse. On the other hand, the
mutual repression between Arx and Pax4 is observed in both mouse and zebrafish.
These data suggests that the main original function of Pax4 during vertebrate
evolution was to modulate the number of pancreatic a-cells and its role in
ß-cells differentiation appeared later in vertebrate evolution.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of different hemostatic agents upon the
outcome of periapical surgery.
DESIGN: A retrospective study was made of patients subjected to periapical
surgery between 2006-2009 with the ultrasound technique and using MTA as
retrograde filler material. We included patients with a minimum follow-up of 12
months, divided into two groups according to the hemostatic agent used: A)
dressings impregnated in anesthetic solution with adrenalin; or B) aluminum
chloride paste (Expasyl). Radiological controls were made after 6 and 12 months, 
and on the last visit. The global evolution scale proposed by von Arx and Kurt
(1999) was used to establish the outcome of periapical surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 96 patients (42 males and 54 females) with a mean age of 40.7
years were included. There were 50 patients in the aluminum chloride group and 46
patients in the anesthetic solution with vasoconstrictor group. No significant
differences were observed between the two groups in terms of outcome after 12
months - the success rate being 58.6% and 61.7% in the anesthetic solution with
vasoconstrictor and aluminum chloride groups, respectively (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The outcome after 12 months of follow-up was better in the aluminum
chloride group than in the anesthetic solution with vasoconstrictor group, though
the difference was not significant.

Islet a-, ß-, and d-cell development is controlled by the Ldb1 coregulator,
acting primarily with the islet-1 transcription factor.

Ldb1 and Ldb2 are coregulators that mediate Lin11-Isl1-Mec3 (LIM)-homeodomain
(HD) and LIM-only transcription factor-driven gene regulation. Although both Ldb1
and Ldb2 mRNA were produced in the developing and adult pancreas,
immunohistochemical analysis illustrated a broad Ldb1 protein expression pattern 
during early pancreatogenesis, which subsequently became enriched in islet and
ductal cells perinatally. The islet-enriched pattern of Ldb1 was similar to
pan-endocrine cell-expressed Islet-1 (Isl1), which was demonstrated in this study
to be the primary LIM-HD transcription factor in developing and adult islet
cells. Endocrine cell-specific removal of Ldb1 during mouse development resulted 
in a severe reduction of hormone<U+207A> cell numbers (i.e., a, ß, and d) and overt
postnatal hyperglycemia, reminiscent of the phenotype described for the Isl1
conditional mutant. In contrast, neither endocrine cell development nor function 
was affected in the pancreas of Ldb2(-/-) mice. Gene expression and chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses demonstrated that many important
Isl1-activated genes were coregulated by Ldb1, including MafA, Arx, insulin, and 
Glp1r. However, some genes (i.e., Hb9 and Glut2) only appeared to be impacted by 
Ldb1 during development. These findings establish Ldb1 as a critical
transcriptional coregulator during islet a-, ß-, and d-cell development through
Isl1-dependent and potentially Isl1-independent control.

Designing a robust minimum variance controller using discrete slide mode
controller approach.

Alipouri Y(1), Poshtan J.

Author information:

Tehran, Iran.

Designing minimum variance controllers (MVC) for nonlinear systems is confronted 
with many difficulties. The methods able to identify MIMO nonlinear systems are
scarce. Harsh control signals produced by MVC are among other disadvantages of
this controller. Besides, MVC is not a robust controller. In this article, the
Vector ARX (VARX) model is used for simultaneously modeling the system and
disturbance in order to tackle these disadvantages. For ensuring the robustness
of the control loop, the discrete slide mode controller design approach is used
in designing MVC and generalized MVC (GMVC). The proposed method for controller
design is tested on a nonlinear experimental Four-Tank benchmark process and is
compared with nonlinear MVCs designed by neural networks. In spite of the
simplicity of designing GMVCs for the VARX models with uncertainty, the results
show that the proposed method is accurate and implementable.

Estimation and prediction of drug therapy on the termination of atrial
fibrillation by autoregressive model with exogenous inputs.

Kuo CE, Liang SF, Lu SS, Kuan TC, Lin CS.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia seen in clinical
practice. Several therapeutical approaches have been developed to terminate the
AF and the effects are evaluated by the reduction of the wavelet number after the
treatments. Most of the previous studies focus on modeling and analysis the
mechanism, and the characteristic of AF. But no one discusses about the
prediction of the result after the drug treatment. This paper is the first study 
to predict whether the drug treatment for AF is active or not. In this paper, the
linear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) that models the system
output-input relationship by solving linear regression equations with least
squares method was developed and applied to estimate the effects of
pharmacological therapy on AF. Recordings (224-site bipolar recordings) of plaque
electrode arrays placed on the right and left atria of pigs with sustained AF
induced by rapid atrial-pacing were used to train and test the ARX models. The
cardiac mapping data from twelve pigs treated with intravenous administration of 
antiarrhythmia drug, propafenone (PPF) or dl-sotalol (STL), was evaluated. The
recordings of cardiac activity before the drug treatment were input to the model 
and the model output reported the estimated wavelet number of atria after the
drug treatment. The results show that the predicting accuracy rate corresponding 
to the PPF and STL treatment was 100% and 92%, respectively. It is expected that 
the developed ARX model can be further extended to assist the clinical staffs to 
choose the effective treatments for the AF patients in the future.

ARX mutations give rise to both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of mental
retardation (MR). We investigated the most common ARX mutations, c.428_451
dup(24bp) and c.333ins (GCG)7 in a series of 370 mentally retarded FMR1 (CGG)n
expansion mutation negative Turkish patients using PCR amplification and high
resolution MetaPhor agarose gel electrophoresis. Sequence analysis was also
performed for confirmation and discrimination of the mutations. One patient
representing non-syndromic X-linked MR showed an abnormal band pattern on agarose
gel and sequence analysis of exon 2 of the ARX gene revealed that the patient had
the c.428_451 dup(24bp) mutation. When we screened the family members, we found
that his sister and mother were also carrier for the same mutation. The proband
showed mild MR and subtle clinical findings like dysarthria and lack of fine
motor functions. In conclusion, the patients with weak fine motor skills and
positive family history for X-linked MR should be screened for the most common
ARX gene mutations.

Severe early-onset epilepsy is due to a number of known causes, although a clear 
etiology is not identifiable in up to a third of all the cases. Pathogenic
sequence variations in the ARX gene have been described almost exclusively in
males, whereas heterozygous female relatives, such as mothers, sisters and even
grandmothers have been largely reported as asymptomatic or mildly affected. To
investigate the pathogenic role of ARX in refractory epilepsy of early onset even
in females, we have screened the ARX sequence in a population of 50 female
subjects affected with unexplained epileptic encephalopathy with onset in the
first year of life. We report the identification of a novel truncating mutation
of the coding region of the ARX gene in a girl with a structurally normal brain. 
Our findings confirm the role of ARX in the pathogenesis of early epilepsy and
underline the importance of screening of the ARX gene in both male and female
subjects with otherwise unexplained early onset epileptic encephalopathy.

Animal models.

Epilepsy accounts for a significant portion of the dis-ease burden worldwide.
Research in this field is fundamental and mandatory. Animal models have played,
and still play, a substantial role in understanding the patho-physiology and
treatment of human epilepsies. A large number and variety of approaches are
available, and they have been applied to many animals. In this chapter the in
vitro and in vivo animal models are discussed,with major emphasis on the in vivo 
studies. Models have used phylogenetically different animals - from worms to
monkeys. Our attention has been dedicated mainly to rodents.In clinical practice,
developmental aspects of epilepsy often differ from those in adults. Animal
models have often helped to clarify these differences. In this chapter,
developmental aspects have been emphasized.Electrical stimulation and
chemical-induced models of seizures have been described first, as they represent 
the oldest and most common models. Among these models, kindling raised great
interest, especially for the study of the epileptogenesis. Acquired focal models 
mimic seizures and occasionally epilepsies secondary to abnormal cortical
development, hypoxia, trauma, and hemorrhage.Better knowledge of epileptic
syndromes will help to create new animal models. To date, absence epilepsy is one
of the most common and (often) benign forms of epilepsy. There are several
models, including acute pharmacological models (PTZ, penicillin, THIP, GBL) and
chronic models (GAERS, WAG/Rij). Although atypical absence seizures are less
benign, thus needing more investigation, only two models are so far available
(AY-9944,MAM-AY). Infantile spasms are an early childhood encephalopathy that is 
usually associated with a poor out-come. The investigation of this syndrome in
animal models is recent and fascinating. Different approaches have been used
including genetic (Down syndrome,ARX mutation) and acquired (multiple hit, TTX,
CRH,betamethasone-NMDA) models.An entire section has been dedicated to genetic
models, from the older models obtained with spontaneous mutations (GEPRs) to the 
new engineered knockout, knocking, and transgenic models. Some of these models
have been created based on recently recognized patho-genesis such as benign
familial neonatal epilepsy, early infantile encephalopathy with suppression
bursts, severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, the tuberous sclerosis model, and
the progressive myoclonic epilepsy. The contribution of animal models to epilepsy
re-search is unquestionable. The development of further strategies is necessary
to find novel strategies to cure epileptic patients, and optimistically to allow 
scientists first and clinicians subsequently to prevent epilepsy and its
consequences.

The authors report detailed clinical and developmental assessment of 3 brothers
who were found to carry a novel mutation in the ARX gene associated with a
relatively mild phenotype of static global developmental delay and early hand
preference. The decision of when to initiate specialized genetic testing for
patients with apparently isolated developmental delay remains controversial, and 
this report of 3 brothers who presented with early hand preference and transient 
contralateral weakness may assist clinicians in prioritizing investigations in
patients with a similar presentation.

Scleroderma (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis, 
microvasculopathy and autoimmune features. The role of genetics is limited in
SSc, as suggested by similar concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twin 
pairs, while environmental factors may act through epigenetic changes, as
demonstrated for specific genes. Further, sex chromosome changes have been
reported in SSc and may explain the female preponderance. In the present study we
compared the methylation profile of all X chromosome genes in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from monozygotic twins discordant (n=7) and concordant (n=1)
for SSc. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitations from each discordant twin pair were 
hybridized to a custom-designed array included 998 sites encompassing promoters
of all X chromosome genes and randomly chosen autosomal genes. Biostatistical
tools identified sites with an elevated probability to be consistently
hypermethylated (n=18) or hypomethylated (n=25) in affected twins. Identified
genes include transcription factors (ARX, HSFX1, ZBED1, ZNF41) and surface
antigens (IL1RAPL2, PGRMC1), and pathway analysis suggests their involvement in
cell proliferation (PGK1, SMS, UTP14A, SSR4), apoptosis (MTM1), inflammation
(ARAF) and oxidative stress (ENOX2). In conclusion, we propose that X chromosome 
genes with different methylation profiles in monozygotic twin pairs may
constitute candidates for SSc susceptibility.

a-cell role in ß-cell generation and regeneration.

Habener JF(1), Stanojevic V.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Molecular Endocrinology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston,
MA, USA. jhabener@partners.org

This review considers the role of a-cells in ß-cell generation and regeneration. 
We present recent evidence obtained from lineage-tracing studies showing that
a-cells can serve as progenitors of ß-cells and present a hypothetical model how 
injured ß-cells might activate a-cells in adult islets to promote ß-cell
regeneration. ß-cells appear to arise by way of their trans-differentiation from 
undifferentiated a progenitor cells, pro-a-cells, both during embryonic
development of the islets and in the adult pancreas in response to ß-cell
injuries. Plasticity of a-cells is endowed by the expression of the gene encoding
proglucagon, a prohormone that can give rise to glucagon and glucagon-like
peptides (GLPs). The production of glucagon from proglucagon is characteristic of
fully-differentiated a-cells whereas GLP-1 is a product of undifferentiated
a-cells. GLP-1, a cell growth and survival factor, is proposed to promote the
expansion of neurogenin3-expressing, undifferentiated pro-a-cells during
development. ß-cells arise from pro-a-cells by a change in the relative amounts
of the transcription factors Arx and Pax4, master regulators of the a- and ß-cell
lineages, respectively. A paracrine/autocrine model is proposed whereby injuries 
of ß-cells in adult islets induce the production and release of factors, such as 
stromal cell-derived factor-1, that cause the de-differentiation of adjacent
a-cells into pro-a-cells. Pro-a-cells produce GLP-1 and its receptor that renders
them competent to trans-differentiate into ß-cells. The trans-differentiation of 
pro-a-cells into ß-cells provides a potentially exploitable mechanism for the
regeneration of ß-cells in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

Potential of chitosan-loaded nanoemulsions to control different Colletotrichum
spp. and maintain quality of tropical fruits during cold storage.

AIMS: To investigate the antifungal activity of conventional chitosan and
chitosan-loaded nanoemulsions against anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp.
isolated from different tropical fruits.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro results illustrated that conventional chitosan
onwards 1·5% concentration inhibited radial mycelial growth, conidial
germination, sporulation and dry weight of mycelia for Colletotrichum musae
(Berk. & Curt) Arx. isolated from banana, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) 
Penz and Sacc. isolated from papaya and dragon fruits. For further
investigations, chitosan-loaded nanoemulsions were prepared, and chitosan at 2·0%
concentration with 200 nm droplet size gave the best results in terms of all the 
in vitro parameters tested for C. musae and at the same concentration with 600 nm
droplet size for both the isolates of C. gloeosporioides. However, the results
obtained at 2·0% chitosan concentration with different droplet sizes were
nonsignificantly different with 1·0 and 1·5% concentrations. Therefore, for in
vivo studies, only 1·0% chitosan with different droplet sizes was used. In terms 
of fungicidal effects and maintaining postharvest quality of banana, papaya and
dragon fruits, chitosan at 1·0% concentration with a droplet size of 200 nm in
banana and 600 nm in papaya and dragon fruits showed the best results in delaying
the onset of anthracnose and maintaining quality of all the fruits for up to
28 days of cold storage.
CONCLUSION: Chitosan used in a conventional form showed good results but not as
effective as in the form of nanoemulsions.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study suggest that
instead of applying chitosan in a conventional form, chitosan in the form of
nanoemulsions could be more effective as a biofungicide for controlling
anthracnose of fresh fruits. Moreover, it could be cost-effective as the amount
of chemical used is reduced when applied in the form of nanoemulsions.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) have been causally linked
to a variety of neurological conditions, particularly, infantile spasms syndrome.
ARX is a developmentally regulated homeobox transcription factor with expression 
both in the ganglionic eminence and the cortical ventricular zone early in
development1. Postnatally, the expression pattern is restricted to GABAergic
neurons in the cortex and basal ganglia. During development, ARX functions
primarily as a transcriptional repressor2: modulating migration and fate
specification of interneurons and controlling ventricular zone proliferation. How
loss of function of ARX leads to an epilepsy phenotype is poorly understood.
Three genetically modified mice lines have been generated35 to address this
issue. These models each develop epilepsy and all have changes in interneuron
subtype patterns strongly implicating alterations of interneuron development as a
cause of epilepsy. Analysis of these models will both further the molecular
understanding of the function of ARX and allow dissection of the
pathophysiological properties of the ARX related epilepsies. This chapter will
review the current knowledge of the function of Arx, the Arx mouse models, and
discuss how these models can lead to a better understanding of the role of
interneuron loss in the development of epilepsy during early childhood.

Infantile epileptic encephalopathies, such as Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome,
West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, and
Landau-Kleffner syndrome, are devastating epilepsies. Cases are often sporadic or
patients have only a limited family history of epilepsy. Although a complex
inheritance has long been suspected in epilepsy, recent data indicate that many
sporadic rare epileptic disorders, such as Dravet syndrome, CDKL5/STK9 Rett-like 
epileptic encephalopathy, ARX-related epilepsies, SRPX2-related rolandic epilepsy
associated with oral and speech dyspraxia and mental retardation, and
STXBP1-related West/Ohtahara syndromes, are due to a mutation in a unique gene.
Dravet syndrome, for example, is mainly due to de novo mutations in SCN1A, the
gene encoding the voltage-gated neuronal sodium channel alpha 1 subunit, which
explains why most patients are isolated cases. All types of mutations are
observed: missense mutations, premature termination codon and intragenic
rearrangements. This large mutation spectrum contrasts with that of generalized
epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), an autosomal dominant condition also
characterized by febrile and afebrile seizures but with a usually benign outcome,
in which only missense mutations are found. Recently, mutations in PCDH19,
encoding protocadherin 19 on chromosome X, were identified in females with an
EFMR or Dravet-like phenotype. Heterozygous females are affected while hemizygous
males are spared, this unusual inheritance probably being due to a mechanism
called cellular interference. The genetic data accumulated for Dravet syndrome
and other related disorders have to be kept in mind when studying epileptic
encephalopathies.

In this paper, we propose a new reduced complexity model by expanding a
discrete-time ARX model on Laguerre orthonormal bases. To ensure an efficient
complexity reduction, the coefficients associated to the input and the output of 
the ARX model are expanded on independent Laguerre bases, to develop a new
black-box linear ARX-Laguerre model with filters on model input and output. The
parametric complexity reduction with respect to the classical ARX model is proved
theoretically. The structure and parameter identification of the ARX-Laguerre
model is achieved by a new proposed approach which consists in solving an
optimization problem built from the ARX model without using system input/output
observations. The performances of the resulting ARX-Laguerre model and the
proposed identification approach are illustrated by numerical simulations and
validated on benchmark manufactured by Feedback known as Process Trainer PT326. A
possible extension of the proposed model to a multivariable process is
formulated.

BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of future glucose concentration for type 1
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is needed to improve glycemic control and to facilitate 
proactive management before glucose concentrations reach undesirable
concentrations. The availability of frequent glucose measurements, insulin
infusion rates, and meal carbohydrate estimates can be used to good advantage to 
capture important information concerning glucose dynamics.
METHODS: This article evaluates the feasibility of using a latent variable
(LV)-based statistical method to model glucose dynamics and to forecast future
glucose concentrations for T1DM applications. The prediction models are developed
using a proposed LV-based approach and are evaluated for retrospective clinical
data from seven individuals with T1DM and for In silico simulations using the
Food and Drug Administration-accepted University of Virginia/University of Padova
metabolic simulator. This article provides comparisons of the prediction accuracy
of the LV-based method with that of a standard modeling alternative. The
influence of key design parameters on the performance of the LV-based method is
also illustrated.
RESULTS: In general, the LV-based method provided improved prediction accuracy in
comparison with conventional autoregressive (AR) models and autoregressive with
exogenous input (ARX) models. For larger prediction horizons (=30 min), the
LV-based model with exogenous inputs achieved the best prediction performance
based on a paired t-test (a = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The LV-based method resulted in models whose glucose prediction
accuracy was as least as good as the accuracies of standard AR/ARX models and a
simple model-free approach. Furthermore, the new approach is less sensitive to
changing conditions and the effect of key design parameters.

development.

Distinct groups of dopaminergic neurons develop at defined anatomical sites in
the brain to modulate function of a large diversity of local and far-ranging
circuits. However, the molecular identity as judged from transcription factor
expression has not been determined for all dopaminergic groups. Here, we analyze 
regional expression of transcription factors in the larval zebrafish brain to
determine co-expression with the Tyrosine hydroxylase marker in dopaminergic
neurons. We define sets of transcription factors that clearly identify each
dopaminergic group. These data confirm postulated relations to dopaminergic
groups defined for mammalian systems. We focus our functional analysis on
prethalamic dopaminergic neurons, which co-express the transcription factors Arx 
and Isl1. Morpholino-based knockdown reveals that both Arx and Isl1 are strictly 
required for prethalamic dopaminergic neuron development and appear to act in
parallel. We further show that Arx contributes to patterning in the prethalamic
region, while Isl1 is required for differentiation of prethalamic dopaminergic
neurons.

CASK aberrations in male patients with Ohtahara syndrome and cerebellar
hypoplasia.

Medicine, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, Japan. hsaitsu@yokohama-cu.ac.jp

PURPOSE: Ohtahara syndrome (OS) is one of the most severe and earliest forms of
epilepsy. STXBP1 and ARX mutations have been reported in patients with OS. In
this study, we aimed to identify new genes involved in OS by copy number analysis
and whole exome sequencing.
METHODS: Copy number analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in 34 and
12 patients with OS, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization,
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and breakpoint-specific and
reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses were performed to characterize a deletion.
Immunoblotting using lymphoblastoid cells was done to examine expression of CASK 
protein.
KEY FINDINGS: Genomic microarray analysis revealed a 111-kb deletion involving
exon 2 of CASK at Xp11.4 in a male patient. The deletion was inherited from his
mother, who was somatic mosaic for the deletion. Sequencing of the mutant
transcript expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the patient
confirmed the deletion of exon 2 in the mutant transcript with a premature stop
codon. Whole exome sequencing identified another male patient who was harboring a
c.1A>G mutation in CASK, which occurred de novo. Both patients showed severe
cerebellar hypoplasia along with other congenital anomalies such as micrognathia,
a high arched palate, and finger anomalies. No CASK protein was detected by
immunoblotting in lymphoblastoid cells derived from two patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: The detected mutations are highly likely to cause the loss of
function of the CASK protein in male individuals. CASK mutations have been
reported in patients with intellectual disability with microcephaly and
pontocerebellar hypoplasia or congenital nystagmus, and those with FG syndrome.
Our data expand the clinical spectrum of CASK mutations to include OS with
cerebellar hypoplasia and congenital anomalies at the most severe end.

Mutational screening of ARX gene in Iranian families with X-linked intellectual
disability.

BACKGROUND: Mutations in the human aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are
amongst the major causes of developmental and neurological disorders. They are
responsible for a wide spectrum of phenotypes, including nonsyndromic X-linked
intellectual disability (NS-XLID), and syndromic (XLIDS) forms such as X-linked
lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), Partington syndrome (PRTS), and
X-linked infantile spasm syndrome (ISSX). The recurrent 24 bp duplication
mutation, c.428_451dup(24 bp), is the most frequent ARX mutation, which accounts 
for ~40% of all cases reported to date.
METHODS: We have screened the entire coding sequences of the ARX gene in 65
Iranian families with intellectual disabilities in order to obtain the relative
prevalence of ARX mutations. At first these families were screened for the most
recurrent mutation, the c.428_451dup(24 bp). For samples with negative results,
single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We identified one family with the c.428_451dup(24 bp) duplication. Three
shifts (one shift in exon 5 and two shifts in exon 4) were also identified among 
the total families. According to the results of the sequencing analysis, two
shifts were not associated with any mutation and the other one was a c.1347C>T
(p.G449G) substitution in exon 4.
CONCLUSION: Hence, we suggest that molecular analysis of ARX mutations as a
second cause of XLID should be considered as routine diagnostic procedure in any 
male who presents with either NS-XLID or XLIDS.

Epileptic encephalopathies comprise a heterogeneous group of severe infantile
disorders for which the pathophysiological basis of epilepsy is inaccurately
clarified by genotype-phenotype analysis. Because a deficit of GABA neurons has
been found in some of these syndromes, notably in patients with X-linked
lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, epilepsy was suggested to result from an
imbalance in GABAergic inhibition, and the notion of "interneuronopathy" was
proposed. Here, we studied the impact of a polyalanine expansion of
aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene, a mutation notably found in West and
Ohtahara syndromes. Analysis of Arx((GCG)7/Y) knock-in mice revealed that GABA
neuron development is not affected. Moreover, pyramidal cell migration and
cortical layering are unaltered in these mice. Interestingly,
electrophysiological recordings show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons displayed
a frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents similar to wild-type (WT) mice.
However, these neurons show a dramatic increase in the frequency of excitatory
inputs associated with a remodeling of their axonal arborization, suggesting that
epilepsy in Arx((GCG)7/Y)mice would result from a glutamate network remodeling.
We therefore propose that secondary alterations are instrumental for the
development of disease-specific phenotypes and should be considered to explain
the phenotypic diversity associated with epileptogenic mutations.

The nature of chemical bonding and metalloaromaticity of Na(2)[(MArx')(3)] (M =
B, Al, Ga) have been studied within the framework of the atoms in molecules (AIM)
theory and using electron localization function (ELF) analysis. The p electrons
of the studied systems were separated from the total electron density and
analyzed. The calculated results indicate that there are closed-shell weak
interactions between the sodium atom and the M(3) (M = B, Al, Ga) ring, between
the sodium atom and the terminal phenyl group on each Arx', and between the
terminal phenyl groups on Arx' in Na(2)[(MArx')(3)]. The Na(2)[(MArx')(3)] has
metalloaromatic nature, and the sodium atoms have an active role in determining
the computed aromatic properties of the three-numbered cycle.

Mutations of the syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) have been associated with
severe infantile epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara syndrome and West
syndrome), but also with moderate to severe cognitive impairment and nonsyndromic
epilepsy. We have studied a white infant who presented with focal seizures at age
2 weeks. Brain imaging was unremarkable. The electroencephalograph (EEG)
demonstrated normal background frequency content but with multifocal sharp waves 
and no evidence of the typical patterns associated with Ohtahara or West
syndrome. Therapy with levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine effectively managed the
seizure episodes. Investigation of genes associated with infantile forms of
epilepsy such as SCN1A, SCN1B, and ARX were negative, but we identified a novel
single-nucleotide duplication mutation, c.931dupT (p.S311FfsX3), in exon 11 of
the STXBP1 gene. This previously unreported STXBP1 mutation in a subject with
neonatal-onset focal seizures broadens the spectrum of clinically relevant human 
disorders caused by STXBP1 mutations.

Mutations in the ARX gene, at Xp22.3, cause several disorders, including
infantile spasms, X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), callosal
agenesis and isolated intellectual disability. Genotype/phenotype studies
suggested that polyalanine tract expansion is associated with non-malformative
phenotypes, while missense and nonsense mutations cause cerebral malformations,
however, patients with structural normal brain and missense mutations have been
reported. We report on a male patient born with cleft lip and palate who
presented with infantile spasms and hemiplegia. MRI showed agenesis of corpus
callosum (ACC), an interhemispheric cyst, periventricular nodular heterotopia
(PVNH), and extensive left frontal polymicrogyria (PMG). Sequencing of the ARX
gene in the patient identified a six basepair insertion (c.335ins6, exon 2). The 
insertion leads to a two-residue expansion of the first polyalanine tract and was
described previously in a family with non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation. 
To our knowledge, ARX mutation causing PMG and PVNH is unique, but the spasms and
ACC are common in ARX mutations. Clinicians should be aware of the broad clinical
range of ARX mutations, and further studies are necessary to investigate the
association with PMG and PVNH and to identify possible modifying factors.

The homeodomain-containing transcription factors Arx and Pax4 control
enteroendocrine subtype specification in mice.

Intestinal hormones are key regulators of digestion and energy homeostasis
secreted by rare enteroendocrine cells. These cells produce over ten different
hormones including GLP-1 and GIP peptides known to promote insulin secretion. To 
date, the molecular mechanisms controlling the specification of the various
enteroendocrine subtypes from multipotent Neurog3(+) endocrine progenitor cells, 
as well as their number, remain largely unknown. In contrast, in the embryonic
pancreas, the opposite activities of Arx and Pax4 homeodomain transcription
factors promote islet progenitor cells towards the different endocrine cell
fates. In this study, we thus investigated the role of Arx and Pax4 in
enteroendocrine subtype specification. The small intestine and colon of Arx- and 
Pax4-deficient mice were analyzed using histological, molecular, and lineage
tracing approaches. We show that Arx is expressed in endocrine progenitors
(Neurog3(+)) and in early differentiating (ChromograninA(-)) GLP-1-, GIP-, CCK-, 
Sct- Gastrin- and Ghrelin-producing cells. We noted a dramatic reduction or a
complete loss of all these enteroendocrine cell types in Arx mutants. Serotonin- 
and Somatostatin-secreting cells do not express Arx and, accordingly, the
differentiation of Serotonin cells was not affected in Arx mutants. However, the 
number of Somatostatin-expressing D-cells is increased as Arx-deficient
progenitor cells are redirected to the D-cell lineage. In Pax4-deficient mice,
the differentiation of Serotonin and Somatostatin cells is impaired, as well as
of GIP and Gastrin cells. In contrast, the number of GLP-1 producing L-cells is
increased concomitantly with an upregulation of Arx. Thus, while Arx and Pax4 are
necessary for the development of L- and D-cells respectively, they conversely
restrict D- and L-cells fates suggesting antagonistic functions in D/L cell
allocation. In conclusion, these finding demonstrate that, downstream of Neurog3,
the specification of a subset of enteroendocrine subtypes relies on both Arx and 
Pax4, while others depend only on Arx or Pax4.

Interneuron, interrupted: molecular pathogenesis of ARX mutations and X-linked
infantile spasms.

Olivetti PR(1), Noebels JL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, United
States.

X-linked Infantile Spasms Syndrome (ISSX) is a catastrophic epilepsy of early
childhood with intractable seizures, intellectual disability, and poor prognosis.
A spectrum of mutations in the Aristaless-Related Homeobox gene (ARX) has been
linked to ISSX, and downstream targets of this interneuron-expressed
transcription factor are being defined. Recent advances combining in vitro and in
vivo methods have unveiled complex interactions between Arx and its binding
partners and their effects on cell migration and maturation that can help explain
the diversity of ARX phenotypes. New mutant mouse models of Arx-induced
pathology, including a recent human triplet-repeat expansion mutation with a
phenotype of infantile spasms and electrographic seizures, provide valuable tools
for exploring the pathophysiology of Arx and substrates for testing novel
therapies.

Is there a Mendelian transmission ratio distortion of the c.429_452dup(24bp)
polyalanine tract ARX mutation?

Intellectual disability is common. Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene is one 
of the most frequently mutated and pleiotropic genes, implicated in 10 different 
phenotypes. More than half of ~100 reported cases with ARX mutations are due to a
recurrent duplication of 24<U+2009>bp, c.429_452dup, which leads to polyalanine tract
expansion. The excess of affected males among the offspring of the obligate
carrier females raised the possibility of transmission ratio distortion for the
c.429_452dup mutation. We found a significant deviation from the expected
Mendelian 1:1 ratio of transmission in favour of the c.429_452dup ARX mutation.
We hypothesise that the preferential transmission of the c.429_452dup mutation
may be due to asymmetry of meiosis in the oocyte. Our findings may have
implications for genetic counselling of families segregating the c.429_452dup
mutation and allude to putative role of ARX in oocyte biology.

Arp2/3 mediates early endosome dynamics necessary for the maintenance of PAR
asymmetry in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Shivas JM(1), Skop AR.

(1)Department of Genetics and Medical Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
Madison, WI 53706, USA.

The widely conserved Arp2/3 complex regulates branched actin dynamics that are
necessary for a variety of cellular processes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the
actin cytoskeleton has been extensively characterized in its role in establishing
PAR asymmetry; however, the contributions of actin to the maintenance of polarity
before the onset of mitosis are less clear. Endocytic recycling has emerged as a 
key mechanism in the dynamic stabilization of cellular polarity, and the large
GTPase dynamin participates in the stabilization of cortical polarity during
maintenance phase via endocytosis in C. elegans. Here we show that disruption of 
Arp2/3 function affects the formation and localization of short cortical actin
filaments and foci, endocytic regulators, and polarity proteins during
maintenance phase. We detect actin associated with events similar to early
endosomal fission, movement of endosomes into the cytoplasm, and endosomal
movement from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, suggesting the involvement of
actin in regulating processes at the early endosome. We also observe aberrant
accumulations of PAR-6 cytoplasmic puncta near the centrosome along with early
endosomes. We propose a model in which Arp2/3 affects the efficiency of rapid
endocytic recycling of polarity cues that ultimately contributes to their stable 
maintenance.

Estimation of changes in instantaneous aortic blood flow by the analysis of
arterial blood pressure.

Arai T(1), Lee K, Marini RP, Cohen RJ.

Author information: 
(1)Aerospace Biomedical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge, MA, USA.

The purpose of this study was to introduce and validate a new algorithm to
estimate instantaneous aortic blood flow (ABF) by mathematical analysis of
arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms. The algorithm is based on an
autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model. We applied this algorithm to
diastolic ABP waveforms to estimate the autoregressive model coefficients by
requiring the estimated diastolic flow to be zero. The algorithm incorporating
the coefficients was then applied to the entire ABP signal to estimate ABF. The
algorithm was applied to six Yorkshire swine data sets over a wide range of
physiological conditions for validation. Quantitative measures of waveform shape 
(standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis), as well as stroke volume and
cardiac output from the estimated ABF, were computed. Values of these measures
were compared with those obtained from ABF waveforms recorded using a Transonic
aortic flow probe placed around the aortic root. The estimation errors were
compared with those obtained using a windkessel model. The ARX model algorithm
achieved significantly lower errors in the waveform measures, stroke volume, and 
cardiac output than those obtained using the windkessel model (P < 0.05).

Arsenotrophy, growth coupled to autotrophic arsenite oxidation or arsenate
respiratory reduction, occurs only in the prokaryotic domain of life. The enzymes
responsible for arsenotrophy belong to distinct clades within the DMSO reductase 
family of molybdenum-containing oxidoreductases: specifically arsenate
respiratory reductase, ArrA, and arsenite oxidase, AioA (formerly referred to as 
AroA and AoxB). A new arsenite oxidase clade, ArxA, represented by the
haloalkaliphilic bacterium Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii strain MLHE-1 was also
identified in the photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium Ectothiorhodospira sp.
strain PHS-1. A draft genome sequence of PHS-1 was completed and an arx operon
similar to MLHE-1 was identified. Gene expression studies showed that arxA was
strongly induced with arsenite. Microbial ecology investigation led to the
identification of additional arxA-like sequences in Mono Lake and Hot Creek
sediments, both arsenic-rich environments in California. Phylogenetic analyses
placed these sequences as distinct members of the ArxA clade of arsenite
oxidases. ArxA-like sequences were also identified in metagenome sequences of
several alkaline microbial mat environments of Yellowstone National Park hot
springs. These results suggest that ArxA-type arsenite oxidases appear to be
widely distributed in the environment presenting an opportunity for further
investigations of the contribution of Arx-dependent arsenotrophy to the arsenic
biogeochemical cycle.

Park, PA 16802, USA. timgilmour@psu.edu

Electrical signals between connected neural nuclei are difficult to model because
of the complexity and high number of paths within the brain. Simple parametric
models are therefore often used. A multiscale version of the autoregressive with 
exogenous input (MS-ARX) model has recently been developed which allows selection
of the optimal amount of filtering and decimation depending on the
signal-to-noise ratio and degree of predictability. In this paper, we apply the
MS-ARX model to cortical electroencephalograms and subthalamic local field
potentials simultaneously recorded from anesthetized rodent brains. We
demonstrate that the MS-ARX model produces better predictions than traditional
ARX modeling. We also adapt the MS-ARX results to show differences in internuclei
predictability between normal rats and rats with 6OHDA-induced parkinsonism,
indicating that this method may have broad applicability to other
neuroelectrophysiological studies.

Limitations in the rapid extraction of evoked potentials using parametric
modeling.

The rapid extraction of variations in evoked potentials (EPs) is of great
clinical importance. Parametric modeling using autoregression with an exogenous
input (ARX) and robust evoked potential estimator (REPE) are commonly used
methods for extracting EPs over the conventional moving time average. However, a 
systematic study of the efficacy of these methods, using known synthetic EPs, has
not been performed. Therefore, the current study evaluates the restrictions of
these methods in the presence of known and systematic variations in EP component 
latency and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In the context of rapid extraction,
variations of wave V of the auditory brainstem in response to stimulus intensity 
were considered. While the REPE methods were better able to recover the simulated
model of the EP, morphology and the latency of the ARX-estimated EPs was a closer
match to the actual EP than than that of the REPE-estimated EPs. We, therefore,
concluded that ARX rapid extraction would perform better with regards to the
rapid tracking of latency variations. By tracking simulated and empirically
induced latency variations, we conclude that rapid EP extraction using ARX
modeling is only capable of extracting latency variations of an EP in relatively 
high SNRs and, therefore, should be used with caution in low-noise environments. 
In particular, it is not a suitable method for the rapid extraction of early EP
components such as the auditory brainstem potential.

Enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract play a central role in
metabolism, digestion, satiety and lipid absorption, yet their development
remains poorly understood. Here we show that Arx, a homeodomain-containing
transcription factor, is required for the normal development of mouse and human
enteroendocrine cells. Arx expression is detected in a subset of Neurogenin3
(Ngn3)-positive endocrine progenitors and is also found in a subset of
hormone-producing cells. In mice, removal of Arx from the developing endoderm
results in a decrease of enteroendocrine cell types including gastrin-,
glucagon/GLP-1-, CCK-, secretin-producing cell populations and an increase of
somatostatin-expressing cells. This phenotype is also observed in mice with
endocrine-progenitor-specific Arx ablation suggesting that Arx is required in the
progenitor for enteroendocrine cell development. In addition, depletion of human 
ARX in developing human intestinal tissue results in a profound deficit in
expression of the enteroendocrine cell markers CCK, secretin and glucagon while
expression of a pan-intestinal epithelial marker, CDX2, and other non-endocrine
markers remained unchanged. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel and
conserved role of Arx in mammalian endocrine cell development and provide a
potential cause for the chronic diarrhea seen in both humans and mice carrying
Arx mutations.

Identification of Arx targets unveils new candidates for controlling cortical
interneuron migration and differentiation.

France.

Mutations in the homeobox transcription factor ARX have been found to be
responsible for a wide spectrum of disorders extending from phenotypes with
severe neuronal migration defects, such as lissencephaly, to mild forms of
intellectual disabilities without apparent brain abnormalities, but with
associated features of dystonia and epilepsy. Arx expression is mainly restricted
to populations of GABA-containing neurons. Studies of the effects of ARX loss of 
function, either in humans or mutant mice, revealed varying defects, suggesting
multiple roles of this gene in brain patterning, neuronal proliferation and
migration, cell maturation and differentiation, as well as axonal outgrowth and
connectivity. However, to date, little is known about how Arx functions as a
transcription factor or which genes it binds and regulates. Recently, we combined
chromatin immunoprecipitation and mRNA expression with microarray analysis and
identified approximately 1000 gene promoters bound by Arx in transfected
neuroblastoma N2a cells and mouse embryonic brain. To narrow the analysis of Arx 
targets to those most likely to control cortical interneuron migration and/or
differentiation, we compare here our data to previously published studies
searching for genes enriched or down-regulated in cortical interneurons between
E13.5 and E15.5. We thus identified 14 Arx-target genes enriched (Cxcr7, Meis1,
Ppap2a, Slc 12a5, Ets2, Phlda1, Egr1, Igf1, Lmo3, Sema6, Lgi1, Alk, Tgfb3, and
Napb) and 5 genes specifically down-regulated (Hmgn3, Lmo1, Ebf3, Rasgef1b, and
Slit2) in cortical migrating neurons. In this review, we present these genes and 
discuss how their possible regulation by Arx may lead to the dysfunction of
GABAergic neurons, resulting in mental retardation and epilepsy.

CYP108D1 from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM12444 binds a range of aromatic 
hydrocarbons such as phenanthrene, biphenyl and phenylcyclohexane. Its structure,
which is reported here at 2.2 Å resolution, is closely related to that of
CYP108A1 (P450terp), an a-terpineol-oxidizing enzyme. The compositions and
structures of the active sites of these two enzymes are very similar; the most
significant changes are the replacement of Glu77 and Thr103 in CYP108A1 by Thr79 
and Val105 in CYP108D1. Other residue differences lead to a larger and more
hydrophobic access channel in CYP108D1. These structural features are likely to
account for the weaker a-terpineol binding by CYP108D1 and, when combined with
the presence of three hydrophobic phenylalanine residues in the active site,
promote the binding of aromatic hydrocarbons. The haem-proximal surface of
CYP108D1 shows a different charge distribution and topology to those of CYP101D1,
CYP101A1 and CYP108A1, including a pronounced kink in the proximal loop of
CYP108D1, which may result in poor complementarity with the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins 
Arx, putidaredoxin and terpredoxin that are the respective redox partners of
these three P450 enzymes. The unexpectedly low reduction potential of
phenylcyclohexane-bound CYP108D1 (-401 mV) may also contribute to the low
activity observed with these ferredoxins. CYP108D1 appears to function as an
aromatic hydrocarbon hydroxylase that requires a different electron-transfer
cofactor protein.

Periventricular heterotopia (PH), clumps of neurons mislocated beside the
ventricle, is caused by failure to initiate migration during embryogenesis. We
report on a 32-month-old Japanese girl with a unique subtype of PH, namely
ribbon-like PH. The patient presented with severe psychomotor developmental
delay, intractable epilepsy, and congenital cataracts and developed West syndrome
phenotype. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a unique undulating form of 
PH, categorized as ribbon-like PH, and other brain malformations including
simplified gyri and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. There was no evidence of
prenatal TORCH infection or associated syndrome. Array-based comparative genomic 
hybridization revealed no chromosomal rearrangements. Genetic analyses of the
FLNA, DCX, ARX, LIS1, and TUBA1A genes showed no mutations. Although little is
known about ribbon-like PH, the clinical manifestations in our patient clearly
differed from those in other reported patients.

Multiscale autoregressive identification of neuro-electrophysiological systems.

Gilmour TP(1), Subramanian T.

Park, PA 16802, USA. timgilmour@psu.edu

Electrical signals between connected neural nuclei are difficult to model because
of the complexity and high number of paths within the brain. Simple parametric
models are therefore often used. A multiscale version of the autoregressive with 
exogenous input (MS-ARX) model has recently been developed which allows selection
of the optimal amount of filtering and decimation depending on the
signal-to-noise ratio and degree of predictability. In this paper we apply the
MS-ARX model to cortical electroencephalograms and subthalamic local field
potentials simultaneously recorded from anesthetized rodent brains. We
demonstrate that the MS-ARX model produces better predictions than traditional
ARX modeling. We also adapt the MS-ARX results to show differences in
inter-nuclei predictability between normal rats and rats with 6OHDA-induced
parkinsonism, indicating that this method may have broad applicability to other
neuro-electrophysiological studies.

Analysis of the respiratory pattern variability of patients in weaning process
using autoregressive modeling techniques.

Chaparro JA(1), Giraldo BF, Caminal P, Benito S.

Author information: 
(1)Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería, Bogotá, Colombia.

One of the most challenging problems in intensive care is the process of
discontinuing mechanical ventilation, called weaning process. An unnecessary
delay in the discontinuation process and an early weaning trial are undesirable. 
This paper proposes to analysis the respiratory pattern variability of these
patients using autoregressive modeling techniques: autoregressive models (AR),
autoregressive moving average models (ARMA), and autoregressive models with
exogenous input (ARX). A total of 153 patients on weaning trials from mechanical 
ventilation were analyzed: 94 patients with successful weaning (group S); 38
patients that failed to maintain spontaneous breathing (group F), and 21 patients
who had successful weaning trials, but required reintubation in less than 48 h
(group R). The respiratory pattern was characterized by their time series. The
results show that significant differences were obtained with parameters as model 
order and first coefficient of AR model, and final prediction error by ARMA
model. An accuracy of 86% (84% sensitivity and 86% specificity) has been obtained
when using order model and first coefficient of AR model, and mean of breathing
duration.

Distinct DNA binding and transcriptional repression characteristics related to
different ARX mutations.

Cho G(1), Nasrallah MP, Lim Y, Golden JA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) are associated with a
wide variety of neurologic disorders including lissencephaly, hydrocephaly, West 
syndrome, Partington syndrome, and X-linked intellectual disability with or
without epilepsy. A genotype-phenotype correlation exists for ARX mutations;
however, the molecular basis for this association has not been investigated. To
begin understanding the molecular basis for ARX mutations, we tested the DNA
binding sequence preference and transcriptional repression activity for Arx,
deletion mutants and mutants associated with various neurologic disorders. We
found DNA binding preferences of Arx are influenced by the amino acid sequences
adjacent to the homeodomain. Mutations in the homeodomain show a loss of DNA
binding activity, while the T333N and P353R homeodomain mutants still possess DNA
binding activities, although less than the wild type. Transcription repression
activity, the primary function of ARX, is reduced in all mutants except the
L343Q, which has no DNA binding activity and does not functionally repress Arx
targets. These data indicate that mutations in the homeodomain result in not only
a loss of DNA binding activity but also loss of transcriptional repression
activity. Our results provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of ARX-related
disorders and possible directions to pursue potential therapeutic interventions.

The RhoGAP domain of CYK-4 has an essential role in RhoA activation.

Erratum in
    Curr Biol. 2012 Feb 7;22(3):259.

Cytokinesis in animal cells is mediated by a cortical actomyosin-based
contractile ring. The GTPase RhoA is a critical regulator of this process as it
activates both nonmuscle myosin and a nucleator of actin filaments [1]. The site 
at which active RhoA and its effectors accumulate is controlled by the
microtubule-based spindle during anaphase [2]. ECT-2, the guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) that activates RhoA during cytokinesis, is regulated by
phosphorylation and subcellular localization [3-5]. ECT2 localization depends on 
interactions with CYK-4/MgcRacGAP, a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain
containing protein [5, 6]. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, the Rho
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain of CYK-4 promotes activation of RhoA
during cytokinesis. Furthermore, we show that the primary phenotype caused by
mutations in the GAP domain of CYK-4 is not caused by ectopic activation of
CED-10/Rac1 and ARX-2/Arp2. However, inhibition of CED-10/Rac1 and ARX-2/Arp2
facilitates ingression of weak cleavage furrows. These results demonstrate that a
GAP domain can contribute to activation of a small GTPase. Furthermore, cleavage 
furrow ingression is sensitive to the balance of contractile forces and cortical 
tension.

Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.

Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies are severe disorders in which cognitive,
sensory, and motor development is impaired by recurrent clinical seizures or
prominent interictal epileptiform discharges during the neonatal or early
infantile periods. They include Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic epileptic
encephalopathy, West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, and other diseases, e.g.,
X-linked myoclonic seizures, spasticity and intellectual disability syndrome,
idiopathic infantile epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy, epilepsy and mental
retardation limited to females, and severe infantile multifocal epilepsy. We
summarize recent updates on the genes and related clinical syndromes involved in 
the pathogenesis of early-onset epileptic encephalopathies: Aristaless-related
homeobox (ARX), cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), syntaxin-binding protein 
1 (STXBP1), solute carrier family 25 member 22 (SLC25A22), nonerythrocytic
a-spectrin-1 (SPTAN1), phospholipase Cß1 (PLCß1), membrane-associated guanylate
kinase inverted-2 (MAGI2), polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), sodium
channel neuronal type 1a subunit (SCN1A), protocadherin 19 (PCDH19), and
pyridoxamine 5-prime-phosphate oxidase (PNPO).

Short-term inhalation of sevoflurane during induction of general anesthesia can
inhibit the A-line ARX index response to intubation: a randomized trial.

Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring hypnotic depth is used to prevent awareness during general
anesthesia. We used the A-line ARX index (AAI) to assess the effect of shortterm 
inhalation of sevoflurane in the prevention of intubation-induced inadequate
hypnotic depth during anesthetic induction.
METHODS: Thirty patients were randomly divided into the sevoflurane and
non-sevoflurane groups, both of which were given 3 µg kg<U+207B>¹ fentanyl, 4 mg kg<U+207B>¹
thiamylal, and 0.2 mg kg<U+207B>¹ cis-atracurium intravenously to induce general
anesthesia. The sevoflurane group then inhaled 6% sevoflurane and 4 L/min O2 for 
3 minutes, whereas the non-sevoflurane group was given 4 L/min O2 alone. Both
groups were intubated 3 minutes after induction. Measurements of the AAI,
non-invasive blood pressure, and heart rate were performed every minute, starting
3 minutes prior to induction until 9 minutes after intubation.
RESULTS: Intubation induced a significant AAI elevation in the non-sevoflurane
group (47.13 ± 20.88, 48.13 ± 20.05, 40.87 ± 15.86 and 31.27 ± 15.26 at 1, 2, 3
and 4 minutes after intubation, respectively, vs. 17.67 ± 6.44 at 3 minutes after
induction; p < 0.05), whereas the AAI remained unchanged for the sevoflurane
group following intubation. Moreover, the non-sevoflurane group demonstrated
higher AAI values after intubation compared with the sevoflurane group. There
were no significant differences in blood pressure and heart rate between the two 
groups throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: Adding 6% sevoflurane with 4 L/min O2 for 3 minutes during the
induction period prevented inadequate hypnotic depth caused by intubation but was
not sufficient to inhibit fluctuations in hemodynamics.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are one of the most
frequent causes of X-linked intellectual disability (ID). Several missense
mutations, clustered in the paired-type homeodomain of ARX, have been identified.
These mutations lead to a range of phenotypes from X-linked lissencephaly with
abnormal genitalia to seizure disorders without brain malformations including
X-linked infantile spasms with ID (ISSX-ID) and X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with 
spasticity and ID (XMESID). The effect of these mutations on the DNA-binding and 
transcriptional activity has been evaluated. Luciferase reporter assays showed
altered repression activity of ARX by all mutations, causing brain malformations 
and ISSX-ID phenotypes, but not by the P353L mutation implicated in a milder
phenotype of XMESID. Similarly, transient overexpression of wild-type ARX
repressed endogenous expression of known ARX targets, LMO1 and SHOX2, when
measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Overall, the
molecular consequence of missense mutations correlated well with the severity of 
the clinical phenotype. In all mutations tested, except P353L, the DNA binding
was abolished. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results were validated using 
chromatin immunoprecipitation following overexpression of normal and selected
missense mutations. Unlike wild-type ARX and clinically less severe mutations,
the mutations leading to severe clinical phenotypes were not able to specifically
bind to DNA upstream of known, endogenous ARX-regulated genes, LMO1 and SHOX2. In
conclusion, the missense mutations in the ARX homeodomain represent
loss-of-function mutations, which lead to a reduced or complete loss of DNA
binding and as a consequence, a loss of transcriptional repression.

Mice lacking the function of the polycomb group protein CBX2 (chromobox homolog
2; also known as M33) show defects in gonadal, adrenal, and splenic development. 
In particular, XY knockout (KO) mice develop ovaries but not testes, and the
gonads are hypoplastic in both sexes. However, how CBX2 regulates development of 
these tissues remains largely unknown. In the present study, we used microarray, 
RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analyses to show that the expression of Sry,
Sox9, Lhx9, Ad4BP/SF-1, Dax-1, Gata4, Arx, and Dmrt1, genes encoding
transcription factors essential for gonadal development, is affected in Cbx2 KO
gonads. Male-to-female sex reversal in Cbx2 KO mice was rescued by crossing them 
with transgenic mice displaying forced expression of Sry or Sox9. However, testes
remained hypoplastic in these mice, indicating that the size and the sex of the
gonad are determined by different sets of genes. Our study implicates Cbx2 in
testis differentiation through regulating Sry gene expression.

Multifactorial inheritance is the most important model accounting for the genetic
behavior of the common epilepsies. Important to this model is the concept that
many cumulative or synergistic risk genes ultimately lead to a threshold effect. 
Sophisticated molecular testing indicates that the common epilepsies are very
polygenic without evidence of any single gene having even a mild-to-modest risk
effect. However, enrichment of copy number variants in cohorts of individuals
with epilepsy indicates that certain structural changes in the genome can confer 
significant risk for epilepsy. The mechanisms whereby copy number variants confer
this effect are not yet known. The study of epilepsy due to single gene defects
however has helped clarify certain seizure mechanisms. For example, discoveries
using animal models of SCN1A or ARX mutations implicate a predominant role for
interneurons due to disturbed GABAergic function. It is hoped that future genetic
and neurobiological studies will provide better insight into how multiple genes
contribute to the common epilepsies.

OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the concurrent validity of the Hamburg
Wechsler Intelligenztest für Kinder - IV (HAWIK-IV; Petermann & Petermann, 2010) 
and the Intelligence and Development Scales (IDS; Grob, Meyer & Hagmann-von Arx, 
2009).
METHODS: HAWIK-IV and IDS were administered in counterbalanced order to N = 172
children aged 6 to 11 years. The study presents the descriptive statistics,
correlations, and an exploratory factor analysis of the data.
RESULTS: There is a high correlation between HAWIK-IV Full Scale IQ and IDS
intelligence score (r = .83). HAWIK-IV indices showed moderate to high
correlations with the cognitive scales of the IDS (Cognition, Language,
Mathematics). Low to absent correlations were found between HAWIK-IV indices and 
the noncognitive scales of the IDS (Social-Emotional Competence, Psychomotor,
Achievement Motivation). The factor structure can be interpreted meaningfully and
allows integration of the IDS cognitive, language, and mathematical subtests into
the four HAWIK-IV indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that HAWIK-IV and IDS test results can be related
to each other.

Data-based identification and control of nonlinear systems via piecewise affine
approximation.

Engineering, 117456 Singapore. g0601819@nus.edu.sg

The piecewise affine (PWA) model represents an attractive model structure for
approximating nonlinear systems. In this paper, a procedure for obtaining the PWA
autoregressive exogenous (ARX) (autoregressive systems with exogenous inputs)
models of nonlinear systems is proposed. Two key parameters defining a PWARX
model, namely, the parameters of locally affine subsystems and the partition of
the regressor space, are estimated, the former through a least-squares-based
identification method using multiple models, and the latter using standard
procedures such as neural network classifier or support vector machine
classifier. Having obtained the PWARX model of the nonlinear system, a controller
is then derived to control the system for reference tracking. Both simulation and
experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm can indeed provide accurate
PWA approximation of nonlinear systems, and the designed controller provides good
tracking performance.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of polycarboxylate cement as
retrograde filling material.
DESIGN: A prospective clinical study was made of 25 patients subjected to
periapical surgery with ultrasound and magnifying loupes, in which
polycarboxylate cement was used as retrograde filling material. Measurements were
made of the area and diameter of the lesions pre- and postoperatively, and 6 and 
12 months after the operation. The apical resection and retrograde filling areas 
were also measured, and the prognosis following surgery was recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 23 patients with 31 apicoectomized teeth were studied (2
patients being lost to follow-up). The mean area of the periapical lesions before
surgery was 52.25 mm2, with a mean major diameter of 6.1 mm and a mean lesser
diameter of 4.8 mm. The success rate after 12 months was 54.7%, according to the 
criteria of Von Arx and Kurt. The prognosis was poorer in females, in larger
lesions, and in cases with larger retrograde filling areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Polycarboxylate cement offers good results, with important bone
regeneration after periapical surgery.

Polyalanine (poly-A) tracts exist in 494 annotated proteins; to date, expansions 
in these tracts have been associated with nine human diseases. The pathogenetic
mechanism by which a poly-A tract results in these various human disorders
remains uncertain. To understand the role of this mutation type, we investigated 
the change in functional properties of the transcription factor Arx when it has
an expanded poly-A tract (Arx(E)), a mutation associated with infantile spasms
and intellectual disabilities in humans. We found that although Arx(E) functions 
normally in the dorsal brain, its function in subpallial-derived populations of
neurons is compromised. These contrasting functions are associated with the
misregulation of Arx targets through the loss of the ability of Arx(E) to
interact with the Arx cofactor Tle1. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for
poly-A expansion diseases: the misregulation of a subset of target genes normally
regulated by a transcription factor.

(PWUT), Tehran, Iran. najimi@pwut.ac.ir

In this paper, an H(8) robust controller has been designed for an identified
model of MONTAZER GHAEM power plant gas turbine (GE9001E). In design phase, a
linear model (ARX model) which is obtained using real data has been applied.
Since the turbine has been used in a combined cycle power plant, its speed and
also the exhaust gas temperature should be adjusted simultaneously by controlling
fuel signals and compressor inlet guide vane (IGV) position. Considering the
limitations on the system inputs, the aim of the control is to maintain the
turbine speed and the exhaust gas temperature within desired interval under
uncertainties and load demand disturbances. Simulation results of applying the
proposed robust controller on the nonlinear model of the system (NARX model),
fairly fulfilled the predefined aims. Simulations also show the improvement in
the performance compared to MPC and PID controllers for the same conditions.

Regulation of cell differentiation programs requires complex interactions between
transcriptional and epigenetic networks. Elucidating the principal molecular
events responsible for the establishment and maintenance of cell fate identities 
will provide important insights into how cell lineages are specified and
maintained and will improve our ability to recapitulate cell differentiation
events in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that Nkx2.2 is part of a large
repression complex in pancreatic ß cells that includes DNMT3a, Grg3, and HDAC1.
Mutation of the endogenous Nkx2.2 tinman (TN) domain in mice abolishes the
interaction between Nkx2.2 and Grg3 and disrupts ß-cell specification.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nkx2.2 preferentially recruits Grg3 and HDAC1 to
the methylated Aristaless homeobox gene (Arx) promoter in ß cells. The Nkx2.2 TN 
mutation results in ectopic expression of Arx in ß cells, causing ß-to-a-cell
transdifferentiation. A corresponding ß-cell-specific deletion of DNMT3a is also 
sufficient to cause Arx-dependent ß-to-a-cell reprogramming. Notably, subsequent 
removal of Arx in the ß cells of Nkx2.2(TNmut/TNmut) mutant mice reverts the
ß-to-a-cell conversion, indicating that the repressor activities of Nkx2.2 on the
methylated Arx promoter in ß cells are the primary regulatory events required for
maintaining ß-cell identity.

in the developing human pancreas.

Physiological Sciences, Life Sciences Institute, 2350 Health Sciences Mall,

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In adult human islets, insulin and glucagon production is
largely restricted to individual cell populations. The production of these
hormones is less segregated during development and during the differentiation of 
human pluripotent stem cells towards pancreatic lineages. We therefore sought to 
characterise the transcription factor profile of these cells that co-produce
insulin and glucagon in the developing human pancreas, and thus to gain insight
into their potential fate during normal pancreas development.
METHODS: An immunohistochemical analysis was performed on human pancreas sections
from fetal donors aged 9 to 21 weeks and from adult donors between the ages of 17
and 55 years.
RESULTS: Endocrine cells were observed within the pancreas at all ages examined, 
with cells co-producing insulin and glucagon observed as early as 9 weeks of
fetal age. The population of cells that co-produce insulin and glucagon generally
decreased in prevalence with age, with negligible numbers in adult pancreas. From
9 to 16 weeks, the population of glucagon-only cells increased, while the
insulin-only cells decreased in abundance. Cells that co-produced insulin and
glucagon also produced the alpha cell transcription factor, aristaless related
homeobox (ARX), and lacked the beta cell transcription factors pancreatic and
duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1) and v-maf musculoaponeurotic 
fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue A (MAFA).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that cells co-producing insulin 
and glucagon in the developing human pancreas share a transcription factor
profile that is similar to that of mature alpha cells and suggest that some
maturing alpha cells briefly exhibit ectopic insulin expression. Thus cells that 
co-produce insulin and glucagon may represent a transient cell population, which 
gives rise to mature alpha cells.

Embryonic stem cells (ES cells), pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell
mass of blastocysts, differentiate in vitro into a variety of cell types
representing all three germ layers. They therefore constitute one of the most
promising in vitro tools for developmental toxicology. To assess the
developmental toxicity of chemicals using ES cells easily, identification of
effective marker genes is a high priority. We report here altered gene expression
during ES cell differentiation into myocardiac and neural cells on treatment with
some embryotoxic and non-embryotoxic chemicals. Decreases in several
undifferentiated markers such as Oct3/4 and Nanog, and elevated expression of
genes associated with heart development or the central nervous system,
respectively, were found on microarray analysis. Under differentiation of ES
cells into myocardic cells, 107 genes were substantially up-regulated. Decrease
in the expression of 13 genes of these (Hand1, Pim2, Tbx20, Myl4, Myl7, Hbb-bh1, 
Hba-a1, Col1a2, Hba-x, Cmya1, Pitx2, Smyd1 and Adam19) was observed specifically 
by embryotoxic chemicals. Of the 107 genes up-regulated under differentiation
into neurons, 22 genes (Map2, Cpe, Marcks, Ptbp2, Sox11, Tubb2b, Vim, Arx, Emx2, 
Pax6, Basp1, Ddr1, Ndn, Sfrp, Ttc3, Ubqln2, Six3, Dcx, L1cam, Reln, Wnt1 and
Nnat) showed reduced expression specifically by embryotoxic chemicals. Almost all
gene sets identified in this study are known to be indispensable for
differentiation and development of heart and brain tissues, and thus may serve in
early detection or prediction of embryotoxicity of chemicals in vitro.

Real-time adaptive models for the personalized prediction of glycemic profile in 
type 1 diabetes patients.

Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Prediction of glycemic profile is an important task for both early
recognition of hypoglycemia and enhancement of the control algorithms for
optimization of insulin infusion rate. Adaptive models for glucose prediction and
recognition of hypoglycemia based on statistical and artificial intelligence
techniques are presented.
METHODS: We compared an autoregressive (AR) model using only glucose information,
an AR model with external insulin input (ARX), and an artificial neural network
(ANN) using both glucose and insulin information. Online adaptive models were
used to account for the intra- and inter-subject variability of the population
with diabetes. The evaluation of the predictive ability included prediction
horizons (PHs) of 30<U+2009>min and 45<U+2009>min.
RESULTS: The AR model presented root mean square error (RMSE) values of
14.0-21.6<U+2009>mg/dL and correlation coefficients (CCs) of 0.92-0.95 for PH=30<U+2009>min and
23.2-35.9<U+2009>mg/dL and 0.79-0.87, respectively, for PH=45<U+2009>min. The respective values
for the ARX models were slightly better (PH=30<U+2009>min, 13.3-18.8<U+2009>mg/dL and
0.94-0.96; PH=45<U+2009>min, 22.8-29.4<U+2009>mg/dL and 0.83-0.88). For the ANN, the RMSE
values ranged from 2.8 to 6.3<U+2009>mg/dL, and the CC was 0.99 for all cases and PHs.
The sensitivity of hypoglycemia prediction was 78% for AR, 81% for ARX, and 96%
for ANN for PH=30<U+2009>min and 65%, 67%, and 95%, respectively, for PH=45<U+2009>min. The
corresponding specificities were 96%, 96%, and 99% for PH=30<U+2009>min and 93%, 93%,
and 99% for PH=45<U+2009>min.
CONCLUSIONS: The ANN appears to be more appropriate for the prediction of glucose
profile based on glucose and insulin data.

Ohtahara syndrome or Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIEE) with
Suppression-Burst, is the most severe and the earliest developing age-related
epileptic encephalopathy. Clinically, the syndrome is characterized by early
onset tonic spasms associated with a severe and continuous pattern of burst
activity. It is a debilitating and early progressive neurological disorder,
resulting in intractable seizures and severe mental retardation. Specific
mutations in at least four genes (whose protein products are essential in lower
brain's neuronal and interneuronal functions, including mitochondrial respiratory
chains have been identified in unrelated individuals with EIEE and include: (a)
the ARX (aristaless-related) homeobox gene at Xp22.13 (EIEE-1 variant); (b) the
CDKL5 (SYK9) gene at Xp22 (EIEE-2 variant); (c) the SLC25A22 (GC1) gene at
11p15.5 (EIEE-3 variant); and (d) the Stxbp1 (MUNC18-1) gene at 9q34-1 (EIEE-4
variant). A yet unresolved issue involves the relationship between early
myoclonic encephalopathy (EME-ErbB4 mutations) versus the EIEE spectrum of
disorders.

Genetic investigations of X-linked intellectual disabilities have implicated the 
ARX (Aristaless-related homeobox) gene in a wide spectrum of disorders extending 
from phenotypes characterised by severe neuronal migration defects such as
lissencephaly, to mild or moderate forms of mental retardation without apparent
brain abnormalities but with associated features of dystonia and epilepsy.
Analysis of Arx spatio-temporal localisation profile in mouse revealed expression
in telencephalic structures, mainly restricted to populations of GABAergic
neurons at all stages of development. Furthermore, studies of the effects of ARX 
loss of function in humans and animal models revealed varying defects, suggesting
multiple roles of this gene during brain development. However, to date, little is
known about how ARX functions as a transcription factor and the nature of its
targets. To better understand its role, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation
and mRNA expression with microarray analysis and identified a total of 1006 gene 
promoters bound by Arx in transfected neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and in mouse
embryonic brain. Approximately 24% of Arx-bound genes were found to show
expression changes following Arx overexpression or knock-down. Several of the Arx
target genes we identified are known to be important for a variety of functions
in brain development and some of them suggest new functions for Arx. Overall,
these results identified multiple new candidate targets for Arx and should help
to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of intellectual disability
and epilepsy associated with ARX mutations.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence concerning the diagnostic yield 
of genetic and metabolic evaluation of children with global developmental delay
or intellectual disability (GDD/ID).
METHODS: Relevant literature was reviewed, abstracted, and classified according
to the 4-tiered American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence scheme.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In patients with GDD/ID, microarray testing is
diagnostic on average in 7.8% (Class III), G-banded karyotyping is abnormal in at
least 4% (Class II and III), and subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization 
is positive in 3.5% (Class I, II, and III). Testing for X-linked ID genes has a
yield of up to 42% in males with an appropriate family history (Class III). FMR1 
testing shows full expansion in at least 2% of patients with mild to moderate
GDD/ID (Class II and III), and MeCP2 testing is diagnostic in 1.5% of females
with moderate to severe GDD/ID (Class III). Tests for metabolic disorders have a 
yield of up to 5%, and tests for congenital disorders of glycosylation and
cerebral creatine disorders have yields of up to 2.8% (Class III). Several
genetic and metabolic screening tests have been shown to have a better than 1%
diagnostic yield in selected populations of children with GDD/ID. These values
should be among the many factors considered in planning the laboratory evaluation
of such children.

Arx and Nkx2.2 compound deficiency redirects pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell
differentiation to a somatostatin/ghrelin co-expressing cell lineage.

Kordowich S(1), Collombat P, Mansouri A, Serup P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical
Chemistry, Am Fassberg, Göttingen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Nkx2.2 and Arx represent key transcription factors implicated in the 
specification of islet cell subtypes during pancreas development. Mice deficient 
for Arx do not develop any alpha-cells whereas beta- and delta-cells are found in
considerably higher numbers. In Nkx2.2 mutant animals, alpha- and beta-cell
development is severely impaired whereas a ghrelin-expressing cell population is 
found augmented.Notably, Arx transcription is clearly enhanced in
Nkx2.2-deficient pancreata. Hence in order to precise the functional link between
both factors we performed a comparative analysis of Nkx2.2/Arx single- and
double-mutants but also of Pax6-deficient animals.
RESULTS: We show that most of the ghrelin+ cells emerging in pancreata of Nkx2.2-
and Pax6-deficient mice, express the alpha-cell specifier Arx, but also
additional beta-cell related genes. In Nkx2.2-deficient mice, Arx directly
co-localizes with iAPP, PC1/3 and Pdx1 suggesting an Nkx2.2-dependent control of 
Arx in committed beta-cells. The combined loss of Nkx2.2 and Arx likewise results
in the formation of a hyperplastic ghrelin+ cell population at the expense of
mature alpha- and beta-cells. Surprisingly, such Nkx2.2-/-Arx- ghrelin+ cells
also express the somatostatin hormone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that Nkx2.2 acts by reinforcing the
transcriptional networks initiated by Pax4 and Arx in early committed beta- and
alpha-cell, respectively. Our analysis also suggests that one of the coupled
functions of Nkx2.2 and Pax4 is to counteract Arx gene activity in early
committed beta-cells.

Nkx2.2 and Arx genetically interact to regulate pancreatic endocrine cell
development and endocrine hormone expression.

Nkx2.2 and Arx are essential pancreatic transcription factors. Nkx2.2 is
necessary for the appropriate specification of the islet alpha, beta, PP and
epsilon cell lineages, whereas Arx is required to form the correct ratio of
alpha, beta, delta and PP cells. To begin to understand the cooperative functions
of Nkx2.2 and Arx in the development of endocrine cell lineages, we generated
progenitor cell-specific deletions of Arx on the Nkx2.2 null background. The
analysis of these mutants demonstrates that expansion of the ghrelin cell
population in the Nkx2.2 null pancreas is not dependent on Arx; however, Arx is
necessary for the upregulation of ghrelin mRNA levels in Nkx2.2 mutant epsilon
cells. Alternatively, in the absence of Arx, delta cell numbers are increased and
Nkx2.2 becomes essential for the repression of somatostatin gene expression.
Interestingly, the dysregulation of ghrelin and somatostatin expression in the
Nkx2.2/Arx compound mutant (Nkx2.2(null);Arx(<U+0394>panc)) results in the appearance of
ghrelin+/somatostatin+ co-expressing cells. These compound mutants also revealed 
a genetic interaction between Nkx2.2 and Arx in the regulation of the PP cell
lineage; the PP cell population is reduced when Nkx2.2 is deleted but is restored
back to wildtype numbers in the Nkx2.2(null);Arx(<U+0394>panc) mutant. Moreover,
conditional deletion of Arx in specific pancreatic cell populations established
that the functions of Arx are necessary in the Neurog3+ endocrine progenitors.
Together, these experiments identify novel genetic interactions between Nkx2.2
and Arx within the endocrine progenitor cells that ensure the correct
specification and regulation of endocrine hormone-producing cells.

Context-specific a- to-ß-cell reprogramming by forced Pdx1 expression.

Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee

Using single transcription factors to reprogram cells could produce important
insights into the epigenetic mechanisms that direct normal differentiation, or
counter inappropriate plasticity, or even provide new ways of manipulating normal
ontogeny in vitro to control lineage diversification and differentiation. We
enforced Pdx1 expression from the Neurogenin-3-expressing endocrine commitment
point onward and found during the embryonic period a minor increased ß-cell
allocation with accompanying reduced a-cell numbers. More surprisingly, almost
all remaining Pdx1-containing glucagon/Arx-producing cells underwent a fairly
rapid conversion at postnatal stages, through glucagon-insulin double positivity,
to a state indistinguishable from normal ß cells, resulting in complete a-cell
absence. This a-to-ß conversion was not caused by activating Pdx1 in the later
glucagon-expressing state. Our findings reveal that Pdx1 can work single-handedly
as a potent context-dependent autonomous reprogramming agent, and suggest a
postnatal differentiation evaluation stage involved in normal endocrine
maturation.

Metabolic impact of glucagon deficiency.

Hayashi Y(1).

Author information:

University, Nagoya, Japan. hayashiy@riem.nagoya-u.ac.jp

Multiple bioactive peptides are produced from proglucagon encoded by glucagon
gene (Gcg). Glucagon is produced in islet a-cells through processing by
prohormone convertase 2 (Pcsk2) and exerts its action through the glucagon
receptor (Gcgr). Although it is difficult to produce a genetic model that
harbours isolated glucagon deficiency without affecting the production of other
peptides derived from proglucagon, three different animal models that harbour
deficiencies in glucagon signalling have been generated by gene targeting
strategy. Although both Pcsk2(-/-) and Gcgr(-/-) mice display lower blood glucose
levels, homozygous glucagon-GFP knock-in mice (Gcg(gfp/gfp) ) display
normoglycaemia despite complete glucagon deficiency. In Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice, the
metabolic impact of glucagon deficiency is probably ameliorated by lower plasma
insulin levels and glucagon-independent mechanisms that maintain gluconeogenesis.
As both Pcsk2(-/-) and Gcgr(-/-) mice exhibit increased production of
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is absent in Gcg(gfp/gfp), GLP-1 is the
likely cause of the difference in metabolic impact of glucagon deficiency in
these animal models. Although all the three models display islet 'a'-cell
hyperplasia, the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. Studies using
Pcsk2(-/-), Gcgr(-/-) and Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice, especially in combination with
a-cell ablation models such as pancreas-specific aristaless-related homeobox
(ARX) knockout mice, should further clarify the physiological and pathological
roles of glucagon in the regulation of metabolism and the control of islet cell
differentiation and proliferation.

In vivo conversion of adult a-cells into ß-like cells: a new research avenue in

Type 1 diabetes is caused by the loss of insulin-producing ß-cells as a result of
an autoimmune condition. Despite current therapeutic approaches aimed at
restoring the insulin supply, complications caused by variations in glycaemia may
still arise with age. There is therefore mounting interest in the establishment
of alternative therapies. Most current approaches consist in designing rational
protocols for in vitro or in vivo cell differentiation/reprogramming from a
number of cell sources, including stem, progenitor or differentiated cells.
Towards this ultimate goal, it is clear that we need to gain further insight into
the interplay between signalling events and transcriptional networks that act in 
concert throughout pancreatic morphogenesis. This short review will therefore
focus on the main events underlying pancreatic development with particular
emphasis on the genetic determinants implicated, as well as on the relatively new
concept of endocrine cell reprogramming, that is the conversion of pancreatic
a-cells into cells displaying a ß-cell phenotype.

Glucagon gene expression in the endocrine pancreas: the role of the transcription
factor Pax6 in a-cell differentiation, glucagon biosynthesis and secretion.

The glucagon gene is expressed in a-cells of the pancreas, L cells of the
intestine and the hypothalamus. The determinants of the a-cell-specific
expression of the glucagon gene are not fully characterized, although Arx, Pax6
and Foxa2 are critical for a-cell differentiation and glucagon gene expression;
in addition, the absence of the ß-cell-specific transcription factors Pdx1, Pax4 
and Nkx6.1 may allow for the glucagon gene to be expressed. Pax6, along with cMaf
and MafB, binds to the DNA control element G(1) which confers a-cell specificity 
to the promoter and to G(3) and potently activates glucagon gene transcription.
In addition, to its direct role on the transcription of the glucagon gene, Pax6
controls several transcription factors involved in the activation of the glucagon
gene such as cMaf, MafB and NeuroD1/Beta2 as well as different steps of glucagon 
biosynthesis and secretion. We conclude that Pax6 independently of Arx and Foxa2 
is critical for a-cell function by coordinating glucagon gene expression as well 
as glucagon biosynthesis and secretion.

The development of the endocrine pancreas and the differentiation of its five
cell types, a, ß, d, e and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells, are a highly
complex and tightly regulated process. Proper differentiation and function of a- 
and ß-cells are critical for blood glucose homeostasis. These processes are
governed by multiple transcription factors and other signalling systems, and its 
dysregulation results in diabetes. The differentiation of a-cells and the
maintenance of a-cell function can be influenced at several stages during
development and in the maturing islet. Many transcription factors, such as
neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) and regulatory factor 
x6 (Rfx6), play a crucial role in the determination of the endocrine cell fate,
while other transcription factors, such as aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) and 
forkhead box A2 (Foxa2), are implicated in the initial or terminal
differentiation of a-cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that
preproglucagon transcription, and therefore the maintenance of a-cell function,
is regulated by several factors, including forkhead box A1 (Foxa1), paired box 6 
(Pax6), brain4 (Brn4) and islet-1 (Isl-1). Detailed information about the
regulation of normal and abnormal a-cell differentiation gives insight into the
pathogenesis of diabetes, identifies further targets for diabetes treatment and
provides clues for the reprogramming of a- to ß-cells for replacement therapy.

A series of new N,N'-diacylhydrazine derivatives were synthesized efficiently
under microwave irradiation. Their structures were characterized by (1) H NMR,
MS, and elemental analysis. Various biological activities of these compounds were
tested. Most of them exhibited higher herbicidal activities against
dicotyledonous weeds than monocotyledonous weeds. In addition, favorable in vivo 
fungicidal activities were also found of these compounds against Cladosporium
cucumerinum, Corynespora cassiicola, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum(Lib.)de Bary,
Erysiphe cichoracearum, and Colletotrichum orbiculare (Berk aLMont) Arx. All
compounds displayed excellent plant growth regulatory activities: 100% inhibition
was achieved against the radicle growth of cucumber. To further investigate the
structure-activity relationship, comparative molecular field analysis was
performed on the basis of herbicidal activity data, resulting in a statistically 
reliable model with good predictive power (r(2) = 0.913, q(2) =0.556). Based on
the calculation, five additional novel compounds were designed and synthesized.
Satisfyingly, compound 4u displayed excellent herbicidal activity (94.7%) at 1500
g/ha, although it is less active than 2,4-D. Meanwhile, this compound also
exhibited good fungicidal activity against C. orbiculare (Berk aLMont) Arx
(82.16%).

Adult pancreatic ß cells can replicate during growth and after injury to maintain
glucose homeostasis. Here, we report that ß cells deficient in Dnmt1, an enzyme
that propagates DNA methylation patterns during cell division, were converted to 
a cells. We identified the lineage determination gene aristaless-related homeobox
(Arx), as methylated and repressed in ß cells, and hypomethylated and expressed
in a cells and Dnmt1-deficient ß cells. We show that the methylated region of the
Arx locus in ß cells was bound by methyl-binding protein MeCP2, which recruited
PRMT6, an enzyme that methylates histone H3R2 resulting in repression of Arx.
This suggests that propagation of DNA methylation during cell division also
ensures recruitment of enzymatic machinery capable of modifying and transmitting 
histone marks. Our results reveal that propagation of DNA methylation during cell
division is essential for repression of a cell lineage determination genes to
maintain pancreatic ß cell identity.

ARX mutations cause a diverse spectrum of human disorders, ranging from severe
brain and genital malformations to non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID).
ARX is a transcription factor with multiple domains that include four polyalanine
(pA) tracts, the first two of which are frequently expanded by mutations. We
progressively screened DNA samples from 613 individuals with ID initially for the
most frequent ARX mutations (c.304ins(GCG)(7)'expansion' of pA1 and c.429_452dup 
'dup24bp' of pA2). Five hundred samples without pA1 or pA2 mutations had the
entire ARX ORF screened by single stranded polymorphism conformation (SSCP)
and/or denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (dHPLC) analysis. Overall, 
eight families with six mutations in ARX were identified (1.31%): five
duplication mutations in pA2 (0.82%) with three new clinical reports of families 
with the dup24bp and two duplications larger than the dup24bp mutation discovered
(dup27bp, dup33bp); and three point mutations (0.6%), including one novel
mutation in the homeodomain (c.1074G>T). Four ultraconserved regions distal to
ARX (uc466-469) were also screened in a subset of 94 patients, with three unique 
nucleotide changes identified in two (uc466, uc467). The subcellular localization
of full length ARX proteins was assessed for 11 variants. Protein mislocalization
increased as a function of pA2 tract length and phenotypic severity, as has been 
previously suggested for pA1. Similarly, protein mislocalization of the
homeodomain mutations also correlated with clinical severity, suggesting an
emerging genotype vs cellular phenotype correlation.

Biological control of red rot in sugarcane by native pyoluteorin-producing
Pseudomonas putida strain NH-50 under field conditions and its potential modes of
action.

BACKGROUND: Rhizobacteria have a good potential to suppress soilborne diseases,
but their efficacy against sugarcane pests is rarely reported. Bacterial strains 
isolated from the rhizosphere of sugarcane were evaluated for their potential to 
suppress red rot disease on two susceptible varieties, Co-1148 and SPF-234, under
field conditions. The strains were also characterised for the production of
secondary metabolites associated with their antagonistic activity.
RESULTS: One out of four strains, the Pseudomonas putida strain NH-50 (EU627168),
reduced disease severity by 44-60% in different field trials. This potent
antagonistic strain produced pyoluteorin antibiotic, as confirmed by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The PltB gene involved in
pyoluteorin synthesis was amplified from the P. putida strain NH-50 and
sequenced. The extracellular metabolites and volatile and diffusible antibiotics 
secreted by the tested strains inhibited mycelial growth of Glomerella tucumensis
(Speg.) Arx & E Mull in vitro by 7-55%.
CONCLUSION: The pyoluteorin-producing bacteria P. putida strain NH-50
significantly reduced disease severity on both sugarcane varieties, irrespective 
of fungal inoculation, i.e. either inoculated through stem or through soil. This 
strain also possesses other plant growth characteristics and can be used as a
biopesticide for sugarcane crop.

Two genes causally involved in refractory epilepsy with mental retardation,
cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 and aristaless-related homeobox, could account for
at least some forms of early onset epileptic encephalopathy that still lack
etiological explanation. With the aim of investigating the specific pathogenic
involvement of the 2 genes, we have conducted a clinical and molecular study in
80 patients with epileptic encephalopathy of unknown etiology and onset within
the first year of life, regardless of the presence of other clinical features or 
the definition of a precise epileptologic syndrome. A total of 8 different
disease-causing mutations were detected in our population, confirming the pivotal
role of these genes in the pathogenesis of the epileptic encephalopathies in
infancy. Early key clinical and electroencephalographic phenotypical features
identified in these patients can contribute to more precise and early diagnoses. 
This work provides a better phenotypic characterization and more stringent
clinical indications for the molecular test.

We report on two siblings with hypotonia, ambiguous genitalia, microcephaly,
ptosis, microretrognathia, thin lips, seizures, absent ossification of pubic
rami, and brain abnormalities at the MRI. The two siblings died at 5 and 8
months, respectively. Molecular analysis indicated that SOX9, ARX, and DHCR7
genes were normal. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-array analysis
performed on the younger boy indicated two notable deletions, one on paternally
inherited chromosome 4, and one on maternally inherited chromosome 5. The same
deletions were found in a normal sister. Differential diagnoses and the
possibility of a hitherto unreported syndrome are discussed.

A novel mutation in the aristaless domain of the ARX gene leads to Ohtahara
syndrome, global developmental delay, and ambiguous genitalia in males and
neuropsychiatric disorders in females.

PURPOSE: ARX, the aristaless-related homeobox gene, is implicated in cerebral,
testicular, and pancreatic development. ARX mutations are associated with various
forms of epilepsy, developmental delay, and ambiguous genitalia in humans. A
mouse model that recapitulates X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia
(XLAG) is far from elucidating the substrate for phenotypes that different ARX
mutations cause. Moreover, despite phenotypic pleomorphism associated with
X-linked dominant ARX mutations, heterozygous female carriers have not been
thoroughly studied. Reviewing records of patients with ARX mutations, infantile
epilepsies, and psychomotor retardation, we analyzed a family harboring a novel
ARX mutation with different phenotypes in males and females, including Ohtahara
syndrome.
METHODS: Children's Hospital Boston patient records were retrospectively screened
for patients with infantile epileptic encephalopathies who underwent ARX
sequencing based on clinical suspicion. Identified families were analyzed for
genetic and neuropsychiatric phenomena.
KEY FINDINGS: The proband was a male with Ohtahara syndrome, ambiguous genitalia,
psychomotor delay, and central nervous system dysgenesis due to a novel ARX
mutation in exon 5, causing a frameshift in the aristaless domain. Heterozygous
females demonstrated neurocognitive/psychiatric phenomena including learning
difficulties, anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.
SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first reported case of Ohtahara syndrome with abnormal 
genital and psychomotor development in the setting of this novel ARX mutation in 
exon 5. Based on the unique phenotype of the proband and on the presence of
heterozygous females with neurocognitive/psychiatric ailments, this study
describes the potential roles for ARX mutations in epilepsy and neuropsychiatric 
disease, underscoring the importance of ARX in interneuron development, cerebral 
electrical activity, cognition, and behavior.

Corpus callosum agenesis, severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and dyskinetic
quadriparesis due to a novel mutation in the homeodomain of ARX.

We report on a patient with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), severe mental 
retardation, infantile spasms and subsequent intractable epilepsy,
spastic/dyskinetic quadriparesis, severe limb contractures, and scoliosis. This
complex, newly described phenotype, is due to a novel non-conservative missense
mutation in the ARX homeodomain (c.1072A>T; p.R358W), inherited from the
unaffected mother. Differently from previously reported non-conservative
mutations falling within the same domain, p.R358W did not cause XLAG. It is
therefore possible that differences in clinical manifestations between our
patient and those with XLAG, are related to the different position of the amino
acid substitution in the homeodomain, or to the different chemical properties
introduced by the substitution itself. To test the hypothesis that the patient's 
mother was asymptomatic because of non-random X chromosome inactivation (XCI), we
performed DNA methylation studies of the human androgen receptor gene,
demonstrating skewing of the XCI ratio (85:15). The complex phenotype described
here combines different traits that had previously been linked to various ARX
mutations, including conservative missense mutations in the homeodomain and
expansion in the first ARX polyalanine tract and contributes to the expanding
pleiotropy associated with ARX mutations.

Islet-1 regulates Arx transcription during pancreatic islet alpha-cell
development.

Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.

Aristaless related homeodomain protein (Arx) specifies the formation of the
pancreatic islet a-cell during development. This cell type produces glucagon, a
major counteracting hormone to insulin in regulating glucose homeostasis in
adults. However, little is known about the factors that regulate Arx
transcription in the pancreas. In this study, we showed that the number of Arx(+)
cells was significantly reduced in the pancreata of embryos deficient for the
Islet-1 (Isl-1) transcription factor, which was also supported by the reduction
in Arx mRNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis localized Isl-1
activator binding sites within two highly conserved noncoding regulatory regions 
(Re) in the Arx locus, termed Re1 (+5.6 to +6.1 kb) and Re2 (+23.6 to +24 kb).
Using cell line-based transfection assays, we demonstrated that a Re1- and
Re2-driven reporter was selectively activated in islet a-cells, a process
mediated by Isl-1 in overexpression, knockdown, and site-directed mutation
experiments. Moreover, Arx mRNA levels were up-regulated in islet a-cells upon
Isl-1 overexpression in vivo. Isl-1 represents the first known activator of Arx
transcription in a-cells, here established to be acting through the conserved Re1
and Re2 control domains.

Caenorhabditis elegans aristaless/Arx gene alr-1 restricts variable gene
expression.

Topalidou I(1), van Oudenaarden A, Chalfie M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027,
USA.

Variable expressivity of mutant phenotypes in genetically identical individuals
is a phenomenon widely reported but poorly understood. For example, mutations in 
the gene encoding the transcription factor ALR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans result
in variable touch receptor neuron (TRN) function. Using single-molecule in situ
hybridization, we demonstrate that this phenotypic variability reflects enhanced 
variability in the expression of the selector gene mec-3, which is needed,
together with unc-86, for the differentiation of the TRNs. In a yeast expression 
system, ALR-1 enhances MEC-3/UNC-86-dependent transcription from the mec-3
promoter, showing that ALR-1 can enhance bulk mec-3 expression. We show that, due
to stochastic fluctuations, autoregulation of mec-3 is not sufficient for TRN
differentiation; ALR-1 provides a second positive feedback loop that increases
mec-3 expression, by restricting variability, and thus ensures TRN
differentiation. Our results link fluctuations in gene expression to phenotypic
variability, which is seen in many mutant strains, and provide an explicit
demonstration of how variable gene expression can be curtailed in developing
cells to ensure their differentiation. Because ALR-1 and similar proteins
(Drosophila Aristaless and human ARX) are needed for the expression of other
transcription factors, we propose that proteins in this family may act to ensure 
differentiation more generally.

Valencia, Spain.

PURPOSE: To compare the preoperative signs and symptoms with the histologic
diagnosis and postoperative healing at 12 months for 178 periapical lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 152 patients who had undergone periapical
surgery from 2005 to 2008 were studied. The study included patients presenting
with signs and symptoms before periapical surgery with a sufficient tissue sample
(periapical lesion) for histologic analysis and a minimal follow-up of 12 months.
The signs and symptoms present in the soft tissues at the initial examination
were recorded. The histologic analysis established the diagnosis as granuloma,
cyst, or scar tissue. The postoperative healing at 12 months was evaluated
according to the criteria of von Arx and Kurt.
RESULTS: Of the 152 patients, 147, with 178 periapical lesions, were included in 
the present study. No significant relationship was found between the preoperative
signs and symptoms, lesion type, and evolution. However, scar tissues were
asymptomatic in 78.1%, and 36.4% of granulomas were painful. Of the 8 cysts, 50% 
were asymptomatic and 50% caused pain. Fibrous scars created no soft tissue
alterations in 68.7%. Granulomas had fistulized in 31.7%, and 75% of cysts had
produced no alterations. The lesions with swelling had worse healing, and those
with no soft tissue alterations had better postoperative healing.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periapical lesions (granuloma, cyst, and scar tissue) are
usually asymptomatic and do not create soft tissue alterations. However, they can
deteriorate, producing pain and fistulization. Worse postoperative healing was
observed for lesions with swelling, although the difference was not significant.

Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) such as autistic spectrum
disorders (ASDs) and epilepsies are heterogeneous disorders that have diverse
etiologies and pathophysiologies. The high rate of co-occurrence of these
disorders, however, suggests potentially shared underlying mechanisms. A number
of well-known genetic disorders share epilepsy, intellectual disability, and
autism as prominent phenotypic features, including tuberous sclerosis complex,
Rett syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. In addition, mutations of several genes
involved in neurodevelopment, including ARX, DCX, neuroligins, and neuropilin 2
have been identified in children with epilepsy, IDDs, ASDs, or a combination of
thereof. Finally, in animal models, early life seizures can result in cellular
and molecular changes that could contribute to learning and behavioral
disabilities. Increased understanding of the common genetic, molecular, and
cellular mechanisms of IDDs, ASDs, and epilepsy may provide insight into their
underlying pathophysiology and elucidate new therapeutic approaches for these
conditions.

Cortical malformations associated with defects in neuronal migration result in
severe developmental consequences including intractable epilepsy and intellectual
disability. Genetic causes of migration defects have been identified with the
advent and widespread use of high-resolution MRI and genetic techniques. Thus,
the full phenotypic range of these genetic disorders is becoming apparent. Genes 
that cause lissencephaly, pachygyria, subcortical band heterotopia, and
periventricular nodular heterotopias have been defined. Many of these genes are
involved in cytoskeletal regulation including the function of microtubules (LIS1,
TUBA1A,TUBB3, and DCX) and of actin (FilaminA). Thus, the molecular pathways
regulating neuronal migration including the cytoskeletal pathways appear to be
defined by human mutation syndromes. Basic science, including cell biology and
animal models of these disorders, has informed our understanding of the
pathogenesis of neuronal migration disorders and further progress depends on the 
continued integration of the clinical and basic sciences.

For the purpose of statistical characterization of the spatio-temporal
correlation structure of brain functioning from high-dimensional fMRI time
series, we introduce an innovation approach. This is based on whitening the data 
by the Nearest-Neighbors AutoRegressive model with external inputs (NN-ARx).
Correlations between the resulting innovations are an extension of the usual
correlations, in which mean-correction is carried out by the dynamic NN-ARx model
instead of the static, standard linear model for fMRI time series. Measures of
dependencies between regions are defined by summarizing correlations among
innovations at several time lags over pairs of voxels. Such summarization does
not involve averaging the data over each region, which prevents loss of
information in case of non-homogeneous regions. Statistical tests based on these 
measures are elaborated, which allow for assessing the correlation structure in
search of connectivity. Results of application of the NN-ARx approach to fMRI
data recorded in visual stimuli experiments are shown. Finally, a number of
issues related with its potential and limitations are commented.

We performed STXBP1 mutation analyses in 86 patients with various types of
epilepsies, including 10 patients with OS, 43 with West syndrome, 2 with
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 12 with symptomatic generalized epilepsy, 14 with
symptomatic partial epilepsy, and 5 with other undetermined types of epilepsy. In
all patients, the etiology was unknown, but ARX and CDKL5 mutations were negative
in all cases. All coding exons of STXBP1 were analyzed by direct-sequencing. Two 
de novo nucleotide alterations of STXBP1 were identified in two patients with
Ohtahara and West syndrome, respectively. No de novo or deleterious mutations in 
STXBP1 were found in the remaining 84 patients with various types of symptomatic

West syndrome from the onset of epilepsy. STXBP1 analysis should be considered as

Contractions in the second polyA tract of ARX are rare, non-pathogenic
polymorphisms.

Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) is a transcription factor containing highly
conserved octapeptide, homeobox, acidic, and aristaless domains, as well as four 
polyA tracts. The most frequent ARX mutation found to date in patients with
X-linked infantile spasms, Partington syndrome or X-linked mental retardation, is
a duplication of 24<U+2009>bp in exon 2, resulting in the expansion of the second polyA 
tract. Although the pathogenic role of this expansion has been well
characterized, the effect of contractions in the same polyA tract is still
debated since different reports have associated contractions to either mental
retardation or a normal phenotype. Here, we report two unrelated girls with
epilepsy and mental retardation who inherited from their unaffected parents, of
either sex, a deletion of 24<U+2009>bp (c.441_464del), resulting in a contraction of
eight alanines in the second polyA tract of ARX. Segregation studies revealed the
c.441_464del also in two healthy relatives of one of the patients. This finding
supports the hypothesis that this contraction represents a rare, benign
polymorphism.

Mutations in the ARX gene cause both nonsyndromic and several forms of syndromic 
mental retardation (MR). Two polyalanine (polyA) expansions of ARX are recurrent 
mutations. The most common one, the c.428_451dup, is associated with a wide
spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from the most severe West syndrome to Partington 
syndrome (MR and hand dystonia), and even nonsyndromic X-linked mental
retardation (NS-XLMR). Studies of patients not selected for specific clinical
signs showed that the c.428_451dup is relatively frequent in families harboring
X-linked MR (7.5%), but less common in familial cases compatible with X-linked NR
(1%), and very rare in sporadic cases (0.1%). The c.333_334ins(GCG)7 expansion is
less frequent and mainly associated with West syndrome. We screened for both ARX 
polyA expansions in 98 unrelated patients selected for the presence of NR
associated with different types of epilepsy and/or with hand dystonia. We also
studied two families with an initial diagnosis of NS-XLMR, one of which was
identified as showing linkage to the ARX locus. The c.428_451dup was identified
in three patients and the c.333_334ins(GCG)7 in one; all of the patients were
from families with two affected brothers. We also found the c.428_451dup in the
family linked to ARX, and clinical re-evaluation showed subtle, previously
undetected signs. Our study illustrates that ARX polyA expansions are primarily
associated with syndromic MR and shows a higher yield (18% in our cohort) when
these mutations are screened in familial cases of MR with epilepsy and/or
dystonia.

CYP101C1 from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM12444 is a homologue of CYP101D1
and CYP101D2 enzymes from the same bacterium and CYP101A1 from Pseudomonas
putida. CYP101C1 does not bind camphor but is capable of binding and
hydroxylating ionone derivatives including a- and ß-ionone and ß-damascone. The
activity of CYP101C1 was highest with ß-damascone (k(cat)=86 s(-1)) but a-ionone 
oxidation was the most regioselective (98<U+2009>% at C3). The crystal structures of
hexane-2,5-diol- and ß-ionone-bound CYP101C1 have been solved; both have open
conformations and the hexanediol-bound form has a clear access channel from the
heme to the bulk solvent. The entrance of this channel is blocked when ß-ionone
binds to the enzyme. The heme moiety of CYP101C1 is in a significantly different 
environment compared to the other structurally characterised CYP101 enzymes. The 
likely ferredoxin binding site on the proximal face of CYP101C1 has a different
topology but a similar overall positive charge compared to CYP101D1 and CYP101D2,
all of which accept electrons from the ArR/Arx class I electron transfer system.

Recently, it has been reported that longer expansions of the polyalanine tract of
the ARX gene could cause an early infantile encephalopathy with suppression burst
pattern and that the length of this repeat region could be related to the
severity of the electroclinical picture. We describe the history of two male
individuals, born from monozygotic twin sisters, with Ohtahara syndrome (OS) that
evolved into West syndrome phenotype and epileptic encephalopathy. In both
children, we have found a previously unreported missense mutation in exon 5 of
ARX gene (c.1604T>A) resulting in the substitution of a leucine with a glutamine 
in the aminoacid sequence. The two mothers and the maternal grandmother carry the
same mutation which segregates with the disease phenotype in the family. This
study confirms that ARX is involved in the pathogenesis of cryptogenic early
onset epileptic encephalopathy, such as OS, and suggests that the severity of the
electroclinical picture is likely to not exclusively correlate with the extent of
expansions of the polyalanine tracts, but rather with the functional effect of
different pathogenetic mutations.

Dynamic characteristics between the subjective score of motion sickness
discomfort and video global motion.

It is well-known that visually-induced motion sickness (VIMS) is caused by image 
motion. Therefore it is important to clarify the relationship between image
motion and the change in discomfort level. However, it is difficult to know the
quick change in the level of discomfort during watching actual video image. The
authors have proposed a method of interpolation for the subjective score, which
has low time and quantitative resolutions, by using physiological parameters. The
model which represents the change in subjective score of VIMS was expressed as
multiple regression equations in which input parameters are cardiovascular
indices such as heart rate variability. In this study, the model which represents
the relation between global motion vectors of a video image and estimated
subjective score was identified as ARX model. The results indicated that the
simple ARX model can estimate the change in subjective score from global motion
vectors.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disease which is characterized by painful
episodes of vascular occlusions. In the present study, we investigated a
potential contribution of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in initiating such
episodes. We observed prominent decreases in microvascular perfusion in response 
to spontaneous sighs, which may increase the likelihood of red blood cell
polymerization followed by vascular occlusions in SCA patients. Time-varying
spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), based on recursive least
squares estimation, was employed to study the modulation of the ANS in response
to sighs. To improve robustness of the spectral estimation while retaining its
ability to track rapid changes, we propose a time-varying parameter estimate
variability reduction (TV-PEVR) technique. Because respiration patterns can vary 
considerably across subjects, we employed a time-varying autoregressive with
exogenous input (TV-ARX) model to adjust for the effect of respiration patterns
on the HRV indices. Results from 8 SCA subjects and 9 normal controls suggested
that the cardiac ANS responses to sighs are not different between the two groups,
after adjusting for the effect of post-sigh respiration. However, the peripheral 
sympathetic response in SCA appeared to be enhanced in this group relative to
normals, and sighs may play a role in initiation of vaso-occlusive events in this
group of patients.

Trial-to-trial noise cancellation of cortical field potentials in awake macaques 
by autoregression model with exogenous input (ARX).

Gamma band synchronization has drawn increasing interest with respect to its
potential role in neuronal encoding strategy and behavior in awake, behaving
animals. However, contamination of these recordings by power line noise can
confound the analysis and interpretation of cortical local field potential (LFP).
Existing denoising methods are plagued by inadequate noise reduction,
inaccuracies, and even introduction of new noise components. To carefully and
more completely remove such contamination, we propose an automatic method based
on the concept of adaptive noise cancellation that utilizes the correlative
features of common noise sources, and implement with AutoRegressive model with
eXogenous Input (ARX). We apply this technique to both simulated data and LFPs
recorded in the primary visual cortex of awake macaque monkeys. The analyses here
demonstrate a greater degree of accurate noise removal than conventional notch
filters. Our method leaves desired signal intact and does not introduce
artificial noise components. Application of this method to awake monkey V1
recordings reveals a significant power increase in the gamma range evoked by
visual stimulation. Our findings suggest that the ARX denoising procedure will be
an important pre-processing step in the analysis of large volumes of cortical LFP
data as well as high frequency (gamma-band related)
electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) applications, one which
will help to convincingly dissociate this notorious artifact from gamma-band
activity.

The mechanism of the modified Ullmann reaction.

Sperotto E(1), van Klink GP, van Koten G, de Vries JG.

(1)Organic Chemistry & Catalysis, Utrecht University, Padualaan 8, 3584, CH,
Utrecht, NL.

The copper-mediated aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions developed by
Fritz Ullmann and Irma Goldberg required stoichiometric amounts of copper and
very high reaction temperatures. Recently, it was found that addition of
relatively cheap ligands (diamines, aminoalcohols, diketones, diols) made these
reactions truly catalytic, with catalyst amounts as low as 1 mol% or even lower. 
Since these catalysts are homogeneous, it has opened up the possibility to
investigate the mechanism of these modified Ullmann reactions. Most authors agree
that Cu(I) is the true catalyst even though Cu(0) and Cu(II) catalysts have also 
shown to be active. It should be noted however that Cu(I) is capable of
reversible disproportionation into Cu(0) and Cu(II). In the first step, the
nucleophile displaces the halide in the LnCu(I)X complex forming LnCu(I)ZR (Z =
O, NR', S). Quite a number of mechanisms have been proposed for the actual
reaction of this complex with the aryl halide: 1. Oxidative addition of ArX
forming a Cu(III) intermediate followed by reductive elimination; 2. Sigma bond
metathesis; in this mechanism copper remains in the Cu(II) oxidation state; 3.
Single electron transfer (SET) in which a radical anion of the aryl halide is
formed (Cu(I)/Cu(II)); 4. Iodine atom transfer (IAT) to give the aryl radical
(Cu(I)/Cu(II)); 5. p-complexation of the aryl halide with the Cu(I) complex,
which is thought to enable the nucleophilic substitution reaction. Initially, the
radical type mechanisms 3 and 4 where discounted based on the fact that radical
clock-type experiments with ortho-allyl aryl halides failed to give the cyclised 
products. However, a recent DFT study by Houk, Buchwald and co-workers shows that
the modified Ullmann reaction between aryl iodide and amines or primary alcohols 
proceeds either via an SET or an IAT mechanism. Van Koten has shown that stalled 
aminations can be rejuvenated by the addition of Cu(0), which serves to reduce
the formed Cu(II) to Cu(I); this also corroborates a Cu(I)/Cu(II) mechanism. Thus
the use of radical clock type experiments in these metal catalysed reactions is
not reliable. DFT calculations from Hartwig seem to confirm a Cu(I)/Cu(III) type 
mechanism for the amidation (Goldberg) reaction, although not all possible
mechanisms were calculated.

Role of cytoskeletal abnormalities in the neuropathology and pathophysiology of
type I lissencephaly.

Type I lissencephaly or agyria-pachygyria is a rare developmental disorder which 
results from a defect of neuronal migration. It is characterized by the absence
of gyri and a thickening of the cerebral cortex and can be associated with other 
brain and visceral anomalies. Since the discovery of the first genetic cause
(deletion of chromosome 17p13.3), six additional genes have been found to be
responsible for agyria-pachygyria. In this review, we summarize the current
knowledge concerning these genetic disorders including clinical,
neuropathological and molecular results. Genetic alterations of LIS1, DCX, ARX,
TUBA1A, VLDLR, RELN and more recently WDR62 genes cause migrational abnormalities
along with more complex and subtle anomalies affecting cell proliferation and
differentiation, i.e., neurite outgrowth, axonal pathfinding, axonal transport,
connectivity and even myelination. The number and heterogeneity of clinical,
neuropathological and radiological defects suggest that type I lissencephaly now 
includes several forms of cerebral malformations. In vitro experiments and mutant
animal studies, along with neuropathological abnormalities in humans are of
invaluable interest for the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms,
highlighting the central role of cytoskeletal dynamics required for a proper
achievement of cell proliferation, neuronal migration and differentiation.

Production of functional glucagon-secreting a-cells from human embryonic stem
cells.

OBJECTIVE: Differentiation of human embryonic stem (hES) cells to fully developed
cell types holds great therapeutic promise. Despite significant progress, the
conversion of hES cells to stable, fully differentiated endocrine cells that
exhibit physiologically regulated hormone secretion has not yet been achieved.
Here we describe an efficient differentiation protocol for the in vitro
conversion of hES cells to functional glucagon-producing a- cells.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a combination of small molecule screening and 
empirical testing, we developed a six-stage differentiation protocol for creating
functional a-cells. An extensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of the
differentiated cells was performed.
RESULTS: A high rate of synaptophysin expression (>75%) and robust expression of 
glucagon and the a-cell transcription factor ARX was achieved. After a transient 
polyhormonal state in which cells coexpress glucagon and insulin, maturation in
vitro or in vivo resulted in depletion of insulin and other ß-cell markers with
concomitant enrichment of a-cell markers. After transplantation, these cells
secreted fully processed, biologically active glucagon in response to physiologic
stimuli including prolonged fasting and amino acid challenge. Moreover, glucagon 
release from transplanted cells was sufficient to reduce demand for pancreatic
glucagon, resulting in a significant decrease in pancreatic a-cell mass.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that fully differentiated pancreatic
endocrine cells can be created via stepwise differentiation of hES cells. These
cells may serve as a useful screening tool for the identification of compounds
that modulate glucagon secretion as well as those that promote the
transdifferentiation of a-cells to ß-cells.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy to treat movement disorders 
including essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Despite over a
decade of clinical experience the mechanisms of DBS are still unclear, and this
lack of understanding makes the selection of stimulation parameters quite
challenging. The objective of this work was to develop a closed-loop control
system that automatically adjusted the stimulation amplitude to reduce
oscillatory neuronal activity, based on feedback of electrical signals recorded
from the brain using the same electrode as implanted for stimulation. We
simulated a population of 100 intrinsically active model neurons in the Vim
thalamus, and the local field potentials (LFPs) generated by the population were 
used as the feedback (control) variable for closed loop control of DBS amplitude.
Based on the correlation between the spectral content of the thalamic activity
and tremor (Hua , 1998), (Lenz , 1988), we implemented an adaptive minimum
variance controller to regulate the power spectrum of the simulated LFPs and
restore the LFP power spectrum present under tremor conditions to a reference
profile derived under tremor free conditions. The controller was based on a
recursively identified autoregressive model (ARX) of the relationship between
stimulation input and LFP output, and showed excellent performances in tracking
the reference spectral features through selective changes in the theta (2-7 Hz), 
alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) frequency ranges. Such changes reflected
modifications in the firing patterns of the model neuronal population, and,
differently from open-loop DBS, replaced the tremor-related pathological patterns
with patterns similar to those simulated in tremor-free conditions. The
closed-loop controller generated a LFP spectrum that approximated more closely
the spectrum present in the tremor-free condition than did open loop fixed
intensity stimulation and adapted to match the spectrum after a change in the
neuronal oscillation frequency. This computational study suggests the feasibility
of closed-loop control of DBS amplitude to regulate the spectrum of the local
field potentials and thereby normalize the aberrant pattern of neuronal activity 
present in tremor.

The ARX gene is involved in the development of GABAergic interneurons in the
forebrain. Loss-of-function mutations, such as nonsense or frameshifts mutation, 
of ARX cause a group of brain malformations, such as hydranencephaly,
lissencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum, while expansion mutations of 
the polyalanine tracts of ARX, supposed to be gain-of-function mutations, result 
in a non-malformation group, such as non-syndromic mental retardation, mental
retardation with dystonia, West syndrome, and Ohtahara syndrome. A variety of
phenotypes caused by pleiotropic mutations of the ARX gene are considered to
share a common pathological mechanism connected with the structural and
functional disturbance of interneurons, designated as 'interneuronopathies'. We
identified the second gene responsible for Ohtahara syndrome, STXBP1, which is
essential for synaptic vesicle release. Molecular studies of the diseases will
reveal the relationships between the structure and function of the brain. It is
indispensable to clarify the etiology of hereditary diseases and identify new
approaches to treatment.

Hydrocephalus is related to a disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) system. For
diagnosis, lumbar infusion test are performed to estimate outflow conductance, C 
(out), and pressure volume index, PVI, of the CSF system. Infusion patterns and
analysis methods used in current clinical practice are not optimized. Minimizing 
the investigation time with sufficient accuracy is of major clinical relevance.
The aim of this study was to propose and experimentally evaluate a new method,
the oscillating pressure infusion (OPI). The non-linear model of the CSF system
was transformed into a linear time invariant system. Using an oscillating
pressure pattern and linear system identification methods, C (out) and PVI with
confidence intervals, were estimated in real-time. Forty-two OPI and constant
pressure infusion (CPI) investigations were performed on an experimental CSF
system, designed with PVI = 25.5 ml and variable C (out). The ARX model robustly 
estimated C (out) (mean C (out,OPI) - C (out,CPI) = 0.08 µl/(s kPa), n = 42, P = 
0.68). The Box-Jenkins model proved most reliable for PVI (23.7 ± 2.0 ml, n =
42). The OPI method, with its oscillating pressure pattern and new parameter
estimation methods, efficiently estimated C (out) and PVI as well as their
confidence intervals in real-time. The results from this experimental study show 
potential for the OPI method and supports further evaluation in a clinical
setting.

Simultaneous onset of infantile spasms in monozygotic twins.

Italy. giangennaro.coppola@unina2.it

The clinical, electroencephalographic, and genetic findings are reported for
three pairs of monozygotic twins who developed infantile spasms in their first
year. In all three pairs, the spasms started on the same day in each member of
the pair. Neither sequencing of the ARX and CDKL5 (alias STK9) genes nor array
comparative genomic hybridization assessment revealed any abnormalities. The
long-term outcome was poor in all twins, although with different severity in
individual pairs. These findings suggest that genes other than those currently
known likely play a role in predisposition to infantile spasms, and that genetic 
susceptibility is linked to a variable phenotypic expression, ranging from quite

The major role of glucagon is to promote hepatic gluconeogenesis and
glycogenolysis to raise blood glucose levels during hypoglycemic conditions.
Several animal models have been established to examine the in vivo function of
glucagon in the liver through attenuation of glucagon via glucagon receptor
knockout animals and pharmacological interventions. To investigate the
consequences of glucagon loss to hepatic glucose production and glucose
homeostasis, we derived mice with a pancreas specific ablation of the alpha-cell 
transcription factor, Arx, resulting in a complete loss of the glucagon-producing
pancreatic alpha-cell. Using this model, we found that glucagon is not required
for the general health of mice but is essential for total hepatic glucose
production. Our data clarifies the importance of glucagon during the regulation
of fasting and postprandial glucose homeostasis.

The paired box homeodomain Pax6 is crucial for endocrine cell development and
function and plays an essential role in glucose homeostasis. Indeed, mutations of
Pax6 are associated with diabetic phenotype. Importantly, homozygous mutant mice 
for Pax6 are characterized by markedly decreased ß and d cells and absent a
cells. To better understand the critical role that Pax6 exerts in
glucagon-producing cells, we developed a model of primary rat a cells. To study
the transcriptional network of Pax6 in adult and differentiated a cells, we
generated Pax6-deficient primary rat a cells and glucagon-producing cells, using 
either specific siRNA or cells expressing constitutively a dominant-negative form
of Pax6. In primary rat a cells, we confirm that Pax6 controls the transcription 
of the Proglucagon and processing enzyme PC2 genes and identify three new target 
genes coding for MafB, cMaf, and NeuroD1/Beta2, which are all critical for
Glucagon gene transcription and a cell differentiation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that Pax6 directly binds and activates the promoter region of the
three genes through specific binding sites and that constitutive expression of a 
dominant-negative form of Pax6 in glucagon-producing cells (InR1G9) inhibits the 
activities of the promoters. Finally our results suggest that the critical role
of Pax6 action on a cell differentiation is independent of those of Arx and
Foxa2, two transcription factors that are necessary for a cell development. We
conclude that Pax6 is critical for a cell function and differentiation through
the transcriptional control of key genes involved in glucagon gene transcription,
proglucagon processing, and a cell differentiation.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes of the CYP101 and CYP111 families from the
oligotrophic bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM12444 are heme
monooxygenases that receive electrons from NADH via Arx, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin,
and ArR, a ferredoxin reductase. These systems show fast NADH turnovers (k(cat) =
39-91 s(-1)) that are efficiently coupled to product formation. The
three-dimensional structures of ArR, Arx, and CYP101D1, which form a
physiological class I P450 electron transfer chain, have been resolved by x-ray
crystallography. The general structural features of these proteins are similar to
their counterparts in other class I systems such as putidaredoxin reductase
(PdR), putidaredoxin (Pdx), and CYP101A1 of the camphor hydroxylase system from
Pseudomonas putida, and adrenodoxin (Adx) of the mitochondrial steroidogenic
CYP11 and CYP24A1 systems. However, significant differences in the proposed
protein-protein interaction surfaces of the ferredoxin reductase, ferredoxin, and
P450 enzyme are found. There are regions of positive charge on the likely
interaction face of ArR and CYP101D1 and a corresponding negatively charged area 
on the surface of Arx. The [2Fe-2S] cluster binding loop in Arx also has a
neutral, hydrophobic patch on the surface. These surface characteristics are more
in common with those of Adx than Pdx. The observed structural features are
consistent with the ionic strength dependence of the activity.

Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders: are there common developmental
mechanisms?

Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsies are heterogeneous disorders that
have diverse etiologies and pathophysiologies. The high rate of co-occurrence of 
these disorders suggest potentially shared underlying mechanisms. A number of
well-known genetic disorders share epilepsy and autism as prominent phenotypic
features, including tuberous sclerosis, Rett syndrome, and fragile X. In
addition, mutations of several genes involved in neurodevelopment, including ARX,
DCX, neuroligins and neuropilin2 have been identified in children with epilepsy, 
ASD or often both. Finally, in animal models, early-life seizures can result in
cellular and molecular changes that could contribute to learning and behavioral
disabilities as seen in ASD. Increased understanding of the common genetic,
molecular and cellular mechanisms of ASD and epilepsy may provide insight into
their underlying pathophysiology and elucidate new therapeutic approaches of both
conditions.

Industrial noise can be successfully mitigated with the combined use of passive
and active noise control (ANC) strategies. In a noisy area, a practical solution 
for noise attenuation may include both the use of baffles and ANC. When the
operator is required to stay in movement in a delimited spatial area,
conventional ANC is usually not able to adequately cancel the noise over the
whole area. Control strategies need to be devised to achieve acceptable spatial
coverage. A three-dimensional vibration-acoustic model is proposed in this paper.
The signal of an accelerometer attached to the bulk of a centrifugal pump
installed in an empty room was used as the input of this model. The signal of a
microphone that changes its position in a spatial grid inside this room is the
output. In the first stage, the ARX models are used to describe a SISO system
where the input is the machine vibration and the output is the noise level
measured at a certain point. In the second stage, spatial interpolation is used
to estimate the model parameters. Results show good agreement between
experimental data and model predictions, indicating the potential of using the
model for the design of ANC.

Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) mutation leads to several neurological
disorders including X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), West
syndrome and Partington syndrome, with XLAG being the most severe form. Although 
some of the brain pathologies of XLAG have already been described, the crucial
extra-brain symptoms are severe growth retardation, transient hyperglycemia and
intractable diarrhea. Since ARX expresses in the islets of Langerhans during the 
embryonic stage, these visceral phenotypes may be related to a loss of ARX
function, which develops endocrine cells in the pancreas. We investigated the
abnormal pancreatic development of XLAG patients with ARX-null mutation. We
performed immunohistochemistry of XLAG pancreases, using the antibodies against
glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, ghrelin, Brn4, Nkx2.2,
Mash1, amylase and pancreatic lipase. As the results, the glucagon- and
pancreatic polypeptide-producing cells were found to be completely deficient in
the islets of Langerhans. We also discovered marked interstitial fibrosis, small 
exocrine cells with loss of amylase-producing cells and an enlargement of the
central lumen of the glandular acini. These pathological findings indicate that
ARX contributes not only to endocrine development, but also to exocrine
development of the human pancreas, and its deficiency may lead to the severe
phenotypes of XLAG patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Changes of the major forebrain commissures in
lissencephaly have not been systematically studied. We investigated the
developmental differences of the commissures in patients with varying types of
lissencephaly to determine whether specific commissural features may help in
distinguishing lissencephaly phenotypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging of 124 patients was retrospectively reviewed.
Patients were classified as having cLIS, vLIS, and CBSC, according to cortical
phenotype; few patients had genetic diagnoses. Abnormalities of the CC, AC, and
HC were recorded, and the overall shape was regarded as hypogenetic, hypoplastic,
dysmorphic, a thin flat callosal body with a vertical splenium, and a convex
upward callosal body, compared with age-matched controls. Correlations between
commissural characteristics and cortical patterns were analyzed by using the
Monte Carlo simulation of <U+03C7>(2), extension to m × n table, and Fisher exact tests 
as appropriate (P < .05).
RESULTS: Patients were classified as having cLIS (57.4%), vLIS (38.4%), or CBSC
(4.2%). The most common callosal developmental anomaly was hypogenesis with an
absent rostrum, a small inferior genu, and a small splenium. An angled (90°)
splenium was found to be significantly associated with cLIS, as was an
excessively convex upward callosal body with VLDLR. ACC with an enlarged AC was
found in all cases of ARX.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific patterns of the commissure anomalies were associated with
certain types of lissencephaly. Callosal anomalies were more common than those of
the AC or HC. Developmental variations of commissures may be useful as an imaging
criterion in differentiating the groups of lissencephalies and may give insight
into the processes causing these malformations.

The Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is one of the most frequently mutated 
genes in a spectrum of X-chromosome phenotypes with intellectual disability (ID) 
as their cardinal feature. To date, close to 100 families and isolated cases have
been reported to carry 44 different mutations, the majority of these (59%) being 
a result of polyalanine tract expansions. At least 10 well-defined clinical
entities, including Ohtahara, Partington, and Proud syndromes, X-linked infantile
spasms, X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia, X-linked myoclonic
epilepsy and nonsyndromic intellectual disability have been ascertained from
among the patients with ARX mutations. The striking intra- and interfamilial
pleiotropy together with genetic heterogeneity (same clinical entities associated
with different ARX mutations) are becoming a hallmark of ARX mutations. Although 
males are predominantly affected, some mutations associated with malformation
phenotypes in males also show a phenotype in carrier females. Recent progress in 
the study of the effect of ARX mutations through sophisticated animal (mice) and 
cellular models begins to provide crucial insights into the molecular function of
ARX and associated molecular pathology, thus guiding future inquiries into
therapeutic interventions.

During corticogenesis, neurons adopt different migration pathways to reach their 
final position. The precursors of pyramidal neurons migrate radially, whereas
most of the GABA-containing interneurons are generated in the ventral
telencephalon and migrate tangentially into the neocortex. Then, they use a
radial migration mode to establish themselves in an inside-out manner in the
neocortex, similarly to pyramidal neurons. In humans, the most severe defects in 
radial migration result in lissencephaly. Lately, a few studies suggested that
lissencephaly was also associated with tangential neuronal migration deficits. In
the present report, we investigated potential anomalies of this migration mode in
three agyric/pachygyric syndromes due to defects in the LIS1, DCX and ARX genes. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded supra- and infratentorial
structures using calretinin, calbindin and parvalbumin antisera. The results were
compared with age-matched control brain tissue. In the Miller-Dieker syndrome,
GABAergic neurons were found both in upper layers of the cortex and in
heterotopic positions in the intermediate zone and in ganglionic eminences. In
the DCX mutant brain, few interneurons were dispersed in the cortical plate, with
a massive accumulation in the intermediate zone and subventricular zone as well
as in the ganglionic eminences. In the ARX-mutated brain, the cortical plate
contained almost exclusively pyramidal cells and was devoid of interneurons. The 
ganglionic eminences and basal ganglia were poorly cellular, suggesting an
interneuron production and/or differentiation defect. These data argue for
different mechanisms of telencephalic tangential migration impairment in these
three agyric/pachygyric syndromes.

Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that have crucial roles in
embryogenesis. A recently discovered set of homeobox genes--the Rhox genes--are
expressed during both embryogenesis and in adult reproductive tissues. The 33
known mouse Rhox genes are clustered together in a single region on the X
chromosome, while likely descendents of the primodial Rhox cluster, Arx and Esx1,
have moved to other positions on the X chromosome. Here, we summarize what is
known about the regulation and function of Rhox cluster and Rhox-related genes
during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. The founding member of the Rhox gene
cluster--Rhox5 (previously known as Pem)--has been studied in the most depth and 
thus is the focus of this review. We also discuss the unusually rapid evolution
of the Rhox gene cluster.

Monitoring depth of anesthesia may improve anesthetic dosing and postanesthetic
recovery in obese patients. Sixty morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic
adjustable gastric bandage (LAGB) were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia
with sevoflurane titrated by either standard clinical parameters (SCP) (target = 
baseline hemodynamic parameters ± 20%) or by A-line ARX index (AAI) (target = 20 
± 5). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, inspiratory and expiratory gas
concentrations, and AAI were recorded in all patients at 5-min intervals, but AAI
was made available only to the anesthesiologist assigned to AAI-monitored
patients. Emergence times in surgery room and recovery times in postanesthesia
care unit (PACU) were recorded at 1- and 30-min intervals. Mean intraoperative
values of AAI were higher in AAI-monitored than in SCP-monitored patients (22.5
vs 15.0, p = 0.001). Compared to SCP monitoring, AAI monitoring reduced
consumption of sevoflurane by 20% (p = 0.014), times to eye opening by 2.4 min (p
= 0.001) and to extubation by 2.5 min (p = 0.009) and to achieve SpO(2) 92% in
room air by 17 min (p = 0.001). Aldrete scores were higher in AAI- than in
SCP-monitored patients at arrival in PACU (p = 0.035), but Aldrete scores = 9
were attained in similar times. AAI monitoring can improve titration of and
recovery from sevoflurane for LAGB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine, Iida-nishi,

PURPOSE: Ohtahara syndrome is one of the most severe and earliest forms of
epilepsy and is frequently associated with brain malformations, such as
hemimegalencephaly. Recently, longer expansion of the first polyalanine tract of 
ARX was found to be causative for Ohtahara syndrome without brain malformation,
whereas premature termination mutations of ARX were found to cause severe brain
malformations, such as lissencephaly or hydranencephaly. Both are designated as
ARX-related interneuronopathies.
METHODS: We investigated the molecular basis of Ohtahara syndrome in two
families, comprising six male patients in two generations demonstrating X-linked 
inheritance.
RESULTS: Novel frameshift mutations in the terminal exon of the ARX gene
(Ala524fsX534 and E536fsX672) were identified in two patients (2 and 13 years,
each) from both families. Two patients developed West syndrome, and one of these 
later developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of all patients showed no brain malformations in contrast to the patients with a 
premature termination mutation in other exons of ARX.
DISCUSSION: The etiology of Ohtahara syndrome is heterogeneous; however, the
molecular analysis of ARX should be considered in sporadic or familial male
patients with Ohtahara syndrome.

Neuronal migration disorders account for a substantial number of cortical
malformations, the most severe forms being represented by lissencephalies.
Classical lissencephaly has been shown to result from mutations in LIS1
(PAFAH1B1; MIM#601545), DCX (Doublecortin; MIM#300121), ARX (Aristaless-related
homeobox gene; MIM#300382), RELN (Reelin; MIM#600514) and VLDLR (Very low density
lipoprotein receptor; MIM#224050). More recently, de novo missense mutations in
the alpha-tubulin 1a gene (TUBA1A) located on chromosome 12q13.12, have also been
associated with more or less severe defects of cortical development, resulting in
complete agyria in the most severe cases of lissencephaly. We report here the
cerebral lesions in a 36 weeks' gestation female foetus with a novel de novo
missense mutation in the TUBA1A gene, presenting the most severe antenatal
phenotype reported so far. Using routine immunohistochemistry and confocal
microscopy, we show evidence for defects in axonal transport in addition to
defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, giving new insights to the
pathophysiology of this form of lissencephaly.

Development and implementation of high-density DNA arrays demonstrated the
important role of copy number changes on the X chromosome in the etiology of
developmental delay and mental retardation (MR). We describe two unrelated
patients with developmental delay due to similar interstitial duplications at
Xp21-p22. The first patient is a 6-month-old male with multiple affected family
members including many females. The second patient is a 5-year-old adopted
female. In both patients, chromosome analysis and array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) showed duplications of overlapping regions at Xp21-p22. The 
duplicated segments contain numerous genes associated with MR, including AP1S2,
NHS, CDKL5, RPS6KA3, SMS, and ARX. Except for developmental delay, there is
little phenotypic overlap between the male and the female patient. Additionally, 
the female patient and affected female relatives of the male patient have
variable severities of cognitive impairment, likely due to different
X-inactivation patterns and effects of other, nonduplicated genes important for
normal development. These cases illustrate that increased gene dosage of X-linked
MR genes lead to cognitive impairment. Precise delineation of chromosome
rearrangements by aCGH and identification of genes within duplicated segments
helped in establishing genotype-phenotype correlations for each of our patients, 
in comparing them to each other, as well as with previously reported cases of
Xp21-p22 duplications. However, we show that even with detailed molecular
characterization, phenotype prediction remains challenging in patients with
structural abnormalities of the X chromosome.

Mutations in ARX Result in Several Defects Involving GABAergic Neurons.

Friocourt G(1), Parnavelas JG.

Author information: 
(1)U613, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Brest, France.

Genetic investigations of X-linked mental retardation have demonstrated the
implication of ARX in a wide spectrum of disorders extending from phenotypes with
severe neuronal migration defects, such as lissencephaly, to mild or moderate
forms of mental retardation without apparent brain abnormalities, but with
associated features of dystonia and epilepsy. These investigations have in recent
years directed attention to the role of this gene in brain development. Analysis 
of its spatio-temporal localization profile revealed expression in telencephalic 
structures at all stages of development, mainly restricted to populations of
GABA-containing neurons. Furthermore, studies of the effects of ARX loss of
function either in humans or in lines of mutant mice revealed varying defects,
suggesting multiple roles of this gene during development. In particular, Arx has
been shown to contribute to almost all fundamental processes of brain
development: patterning, neuronal proliferation and migration, cell maturation
and differentiation, as well as axonal outgrowth and connectivity. In this
review, we will present and discuss recent findings concerning the role of ARX in
brain development and how this information will be useful to better understand
the pathophysiological mechanisms of mental retardation and epilepsy associated
with ARX mutations.

Black-box modeling to estimate tissue temperature during radiofrequency catheter 
cardiac ablation: Feasibility study on an agar phantom model.

Author information:

Politécnica de Valencia, Spain.

The aim of this work was to study linear deterministic models to predict tissue
temperature during radiofrequency cardiac ablation (RFCA) by measuring magnitudes
such as electrode temperature, power and impedance between active and dispersive 
electrodes. The concept involves autoregressive models with exogenous input
(ARX), which is a particular case of the autoregressive moving average model with
exogenous input (ARMAX). The values of the mode parameters were determined from a
least-squares fit of experimental data. The data were obtained from
radiofrequency ablations conducted on agar models with different contact pressure
conditions between electrode and agar (0 and 20 g) and different flow rates
around the electrode (1, 1.5 and 2 L min(-1)). Half of all the ablations were
chosen randomly to be used for identification (i.e. determination of model
parameters) and the other half were used for model validation. The results
suggest that (1) a linear model can be developed to predict tissue temperature at
a depth of 4.5 mm during RF cardiac ablation by using the variables applied
power, impedance and electrode temperature; (2) the best model provides a
reasonably accurate estimate of tissue temperature with a 60% probability of
achieving average errors better than 5 degrees C; (3) substantial errors (larger 
than 15 degrees C) were found only in 6.6% of cases and were associated with
abnormal experiments (e.g. those involving the displacement of the ablation
electrode) and (4) the impact of measuring impedance on the overall estimate is
negligible (around 1 degrees C).

INTRODUCTION: Accessing the tooth roots in periapical surgery (PS) requires the
elimination of periapical bone.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the postoperative morbidity and prognosis following PS on
mandibular molars by ostectomy, or by osteotomy with repositioning of the
vestibular cortical.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective clinical study of mandibular molars
subjected to PS with ultrasound. Two groups were considered according to the
surgical procedure used to access the roots: Group 1 (G1) with ostectomy and
Group 2 (G2) with osteotomy and repositioning of the vestibular cortical. Only
patients who had properly followed the post-operative instructions, adequately
completed the post-operative questionnaires, and with a minimum of 12 months
follow-up were included in the study. Post-operative morbidity was evaluated, and
a clinical and radiographic follow-up was carried out using the criteria
established by von Arx and Kurt in 1999. The SPSS program version 15 for Windows 
was used, considering values of p < or =0.05 as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients, including 18 men and 57 women, with 87 mandibular
molars and 107 periapical lesions were subjected to PS. The mean age of the
patients was 38.5 years old (range 15-74 years old). The patients were monitored 
for an average of 27.2 months (range 12-120 months). Sixty-six patients (78
teeth) were treated in G1, and 9 patients (9 teeth) in G2. There was no
relationship between the size of the ostectomy and pain, swelling or prognosis
(p>0.05). Patients who underwent ostectomy presented more swelling than those
subjected to osteotomy (p<0.05). There was no relationship between prognosis and 
the variables studied (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant relationship between the
surgical procedure used and post-operative pain or prognosis. Patients who
underwent an ostectomy presented more swelling than those who were treated with
an osteotomy and repositioning of the vestibular cortical.

Mutations in the nuclear localization sequence of the Aristaless related
homeobox; sequestration of mutant ARX with IPO13 disrupts normal subcellular
distribution of the transcription factor and retards cell division.

BACKGROUND: Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) is a paired-type homeobox gene. ARX
function is frequently affected by naturally occurring mutations. Nonsense
mutations, polyalanine tract expansions and missense mutations in ARX cause a
range of intellectual disability and epilepsy phenotypes with or without
additional features including hand dystonia, lissencephaly, autism or dysarthria.
Severe malformation phenotypes, such as X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous
genitalia (XLAG), are frequently observed in individuals with protein truncating 
or missense mutations clustered in the highly conserved paired-type homeodomain.
RESULTS: We have identified two novel point mutations in the R379 residue of the 
ARX homeodomain; c.1135C>A, p.R379S in a patient with infantile spasms and
intellectual disability and c.1136G>T, p.R379L in a patient with XLAG. We
investigated these and other missense mutations (R332P, R332H, R332C, T333N:
associated with XLAG and Proud syndrome) predicted to affect the nuclear
localisation sequences (NLS) flanking either end of the ARX homeodomain. The NLS 
regions are required for correct nuclear import facilitated by Importin 13
(IPO13). We demonstrate that missense mutations in either the N- or C-terminal
NLS regions of the homeodomain cause significant disruption to nuclear
localisation of the ARX protein in vitro. Surprisingly, none of these mutations
abolished the binding of ARX to IPO13. This was confirmed by
co-immunoprecipitation and immmuno fluorescence studies. Instead, tagged and
endogenous IPO13 remained bound to the mutant ARX proteins, even in the RanGTP
rich nuclear environment. We also identify the microtubule protein TUBA1A as a
novel interacting protein for ARX and show cells expressing mutant ARX protein
accumulate in mitosis, indicating normal cell division may be disrupted.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the most likely, common pathogenic mechanism of the
missense mutations in NLS regions of the ARX homeodomain is inadequate
accumulation and distribution of the ARX transcription factor within the nucleus 
due to sequestration of ARX with IPO13.

Experimental evaluation of a recursive model identification technique for type 1 
diabetes.

BACKGROUND: A model-based controller for an artificial beta cell requires an
accurate model of the glucose-insulin dynamics in type 1 diabetes subjects. To
ensure the robustness of the controller for changing conditions (e.g., changes in
insulin sensitivity due to illnesses, changes in exercise habits, or changes in
stress levels), the model should be able to adapt to the new conditions by means 
of a recursive parameter estimation technique. Such an adaptive strategy will
ensure that the most accurate model is used for the current conditions, and thus 
the most accurate model predictions are used in model-based control calculations.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, empirical dynamic autoregressive exogenous 
input (ARX) models were identified from glucose-insulin data for nine type 1
diabetes subjects in ambulatory conditions. Data sets consisted of continuous
(5-minute) glucose concentration measurements obtained from a continuous glucose 
monitor, basal insulin infusion rates and times and amounts of insulin boluses
obtained from the subjects' insulin pumps, and subject-reported estimates of the 
times and carbohydrate content of meals. Two identification techniques were
investigated: nonrecursive, or batch methods, and recursive methods. Batch models
were identified from a set of training data, whereas recursively identified
models were updated at each sampling instant. Both types of models were used to
make predictions of new test data. For the purpose of comparison, model
predictions were compared to zero-order hold (ZOH) predictions, which were made
by simply holding the current glucose value constant for p steps into the future,
where p is the prediction horizon. Thus, the ZOH predictions are model free and
provide a base case for the prediction metrics used to quantify the accuracy of
the model predictions. In theory, recursive identification techniques are needed 
only when there are changing conditions in the subject that require model
adaptation. Thus, the identification and validation techniques were performed
with both "normal" data and data collected during conditions of reduced insulin
sensitivity. The latter were achieved by having the subjects self-administer a
medication, prednisone, for 3 consecutive days. The recursive models were allowed
to adapt to this condition of reduced insulin sensitivity, while the batch models
were only identified from normal data.
RESULTS: Data from nine type 1 diabetes subjects in ambulatory conditions were
analyzed; six of these subjects also participated in the prednisone portion of
the study. For normal test data, the batch ARX models produced 30-, 45-, and
60-minute-ahead predictions that had average root mean square error (RMSE) values
of 26, 34, and 40 mg/dl, respectively. For test data characterized by reduced
insulin sensitivity, the batch ARX models produced 30-, 60-, and 90-minute-ahead 
predictions with average RMSE values of 27, 46, and 59 mg/dl, respectively; the
recursive ARX models demonstrated similar performance with corresponding values
of 27, 45, and 61 mg/dl, respectively. The identified ARX models (batch and
recursive) produced more accurate predictions than the model-free ZOH
predictions, but only marginally. For test data characterized by reduced insulin 
sensitivity, RMSE values for the predictions of the batch ARX models were 9, 5,
and 5% more accurate than the ZOH predictions for prediction horizons of 30, 60, 
and 90 minutes, respectively. In terms of RMSE values, the 30-, 60-, and
90-minute predictions of the recursive models were more accurate than the ZOH
predictions, by 10, 5, and 2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this experimental study, the recursively identified ARX models
resulted in predictions of test data that were similar, but not superior, to the 
batch models. Even for the test data characteristic of reduced insulin
sensitivity, the batch and recursive models demonstrated similar prediction
accuracy. The predictions of the identified ARX models were only marginally more 
accurate than the model-free ZOH predictions. Given the simplicity of the ARX
models and the computational ease with which they are identified, however, even
modest improvements may justify the use of these models in a model-based
controller for an artificial beta cell.

Run-to-run tuning of model predictive control for type 1 diabetes subjects: in
silico trial.

BACKGROUND: The technological advancements in subcutaneous continuous glucose
monitoring and insulin pump delivery systems have paved the way to clinical
testing of artificial pancreas devices. The experience derived by clinical trials
poses technological challenges to the automatic control expert, the most notable 
being the large interpatient and intrapatient variability and the inherent
uncertainty of patient information.
METHODS: A new model predictive control (MPC) glucose control system is proposed.
The starting point is an MPC algorithm applied in 20 type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM) subjects. Three main changes are introduced: individualization of the ARX 
model used for prediction; synthesis of the MPC law on top of the open-loop
basal/bolus therapy; and a run-to-run approach for implementing day-by-day tuning
of the algorithm. In order to individualize the ARX model, a sufficiently
exciting insulin profile is imposed by splitting the premeal bolus into two
smaller boluses (40% and 60%) injected 30 min before and 30 min after the meal.
RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was tested on 100 virtual subjects extracted from
an in silico T1DM population. The trial simulates 44 consecutive days, during
which the patient receives breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day. For 10 days,
meals are multiplied by a random variable uniformly distributed in [0.5, 1.5],
while insulin delivery is based on nominal meals. Moreover, for 10 days, either a
linear increase or decrease of insulin sensitivity (+/-25% of nominal value) is
introduced.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARX model identification procedure offers an automatic tool for 
patient model individualization. The run-to-run approach is an effective way to
auto-tune the aggressiveness of the closed-loop control law, is robust to meal
variation, and is also capable of adapting the regulator to slow parameter
variations, e.g., on insulin sensitivity.

Rfx6 is an Ngn3-dependent winged helix transcription factor required for
pancreatic islet cell development.

The transcription factor neurogenin 3 (Neurog3 or Ngn3) controls islet cell fate 
specification in multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells in the mouse embryo.
However, our knowledge of the genetic programs implemented by Ngn3, which control
generic and islet subtype-specific properties, is still fragmentary. Gene
expression profiling in isolated Ngn3-positive progenitor cells resulted in the
identification of the uncharacterized winged helix transcription factor Rfx6.
Rfx6 is initially expressed broadly in the gut endoderm, notably in Pdx1-positive
cells in the developing pancreatic buds, and then becomes progressively
restricted to the endocrine lineage, suggesting a dual function in both endoderm 
development and islet cell differentiation. Rfx6 is found in postmitotic islet
progenitor cells in the embryo and is maintained in all developing and adult
islet cell types. Rfx6 is dependent on Ngn3 and acts upstream of or in parallel
with NeuroD, Pax4 and Arx transcription factors during islet cell
differentiation. In zebrafish, the Rfx6 ortholog is similarly found in
progenitors and hormone expressing cells of the islet lineage. Loss-of-function
studies in zebrafish revealed that rfx6 is required for the differentiation of
glucagon-, ghrelin- and somatostatin-expressing cells, which, in the absence of
rfx6, are blocked at the progenitor stage. By contrast, beta cells, whose number 
is only slightly reduced, were no longer clustered in a compact islet. These data
unveil Rfx6 as a novel regulator of islet cell development.

The ARX (Aristaless-related (X-linked) homeobox) gene is not only present in
arthropods and their ancestors, but also in vertebrates including humans (ARX
orthologs). The gene is composed of 5 coding exons and it is expressed
predominantly in foetal and adult brain and skeletal muscle. In this review we
report on our experience and review the existing literature on the genotype and
phenotype heterogeneity associated with ARX abnormalities in humans ranging from 
severe neuronal migration defects (e.g., lissencephaly), to mild forms of
X-linked mental retardation without apparent brain abnormalities. The ARX-related
disorders are reviewed focusing on their clinical features and on the role of the
ARX gene. It has yet to be established whether the molecular defect alone could
cause a given cerebral abnormality and/or malformation or an additional or
related molecular or environmental event could contribute to a given phenotype in
molecularly.

In vivo roles for Arp2/3 in cortical actin organization during C. elegans
gastrulation.

The Arp2/3 complex is important for morphogenesis in various developmental
systems, but specific in vivo roles for this complex in cells that move during
morphogenesis are not well understood. We have examined cellular roles for Arp2/3
in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. In C. elegans, the first morphogenetic
movement, gastrulation, is initiated by the internalization of two endodermal
precursor cells. These cells undergo a myosin-dependent apical constriction,
pulling a ring of six neighboring cells into a gap left behind on the ventral
surface of the embryo. In agreement with a previous report, we found that in
Arp2/3-depleted C. elegans embryos, membrane blebs form and the endodermal
precursor cells fail to fully internalize. We show that these cells are normal
with respect to several key requirements for gastrulation: cell cycle timing,
cell fate, apicobasal cell polarity and apical accumulation and activation of
myosin-II. To further understand the function of Arp2/3 in gastrulation, we
examined F-actin dynamics in wild-type embryos. We found that three of the six
neighboring cells extend short, dynamic F-actin-rich processes at their apical
borders with the internalizing cells. These processes failed to form in embryos
that were depleted of Arp2/3 or the apical protein PAR-3. Our results identify an
in vivo role for Arp2/3 in the formation of subcellular structures during
morphogenesis. The results also suggest a new layer to the model of C. elegans
gastrulation: in addition to apical constriction, internalization of the endoderm
might involve dynamic Arp2/3-dependent F-actin-rich extensions on one side of a
ring of cells.

Multiple bioactive peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),
and GLP-2, are derived from the glucagon gene (Gcg). In the present study, we
disrupted Gcg by introduction of GFP cDNA and established a knock-in mouse line. 
Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice that lack most, if not all, of Gcg-derived peptides were born
in an expected Mendelian ratio without gross abnormalities. Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice
showed lower blood glucose levels at 2 wk of age, but those in adult Gcg(gfp/gfp)
mice were not significantly different from those in Gcg(+/+) and Gcg(gfp/+) mice,
even after starvation for 16 h. Serum insulin levels in Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice were
lower than in Gcg(+/+) and Gcg(gfp/+) on ad libitum feeding, but no significant
differences were observed on starvation. Islet alpha-cells and intestinal L-cells
were readily visualized in Gcg(gfp/gfp) and Gcg(gfp/+) mice under fluorescence.
The Gcg(gfp/gfp) postnatally developed hyperplasia of islet alpha-cells, whereas 
the population of intestinal L-cells was not increased. In the Gcg(gfp/gfp),
expression of Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) was markedly increased in
pancreas but not in intestine and suggested involvement of Arx in differential
regulation of proliferation of Gcg-expressing cells. These results illustrated
that Gcg-derived peptides are dispensable for survival and maintaining
normoglycemia in adult mice and that Gcg-derived peptides differentially regulate
proliferation/differentiation of alpha-cells and L-cells. The present model is
useful for analyzing glucose/energy metabolism in the absence of Gcg-derived
peptides. It is useful also for analysis of the development, differentiation, and
function of Gcg-expressing cells, because such cells are readily visualized by
fluorescence in this model.

The Arp2/3 complex, UNC-115/abLIM, and UNC-34/Enabled regulate axon guidance and 
growth cone filopodia formation in Caenorhabditis elegans.

USA. adnorris@ku.edu

BACKGROUND: While many molecules involved in axon guidance have been identified, 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these molecules regulate growth
cone morphology during axon outgrowth remain to be elucidated. The actin
cytoskeleton of the growth cone underlies the formation of lamellipodia and
filopodia that control growth cone outgrowth and guidance. The role of the Arp2/3
complex in growth cone filopodia formation has been controversial, and other
mechanisms of growth cone filopodia formation remain to be described.
RESULTS: Here we show that mutations in genes encoding the Arp2/3 complex (arx
genes) caused defects in axon guidance. Analysis of developing growth cones in
vivo showed that arx mutants displayed defects in filopodia and reduced growth
cone size. Time-lapse analysis of growth cones in living animals indicated that
arx mutants affected the rate of growth cone filopodia formation but not
filopodia stability or length. Two other actin modulatory proteins, UNC-115/abLIM
and UNC-34/Enabled, that had been shown previously to affect axon guidance had
overlapping roles with Arp2/3 in axon guidance and also affected the rate of
filopodia initiation but not stability or length.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the Arp2/3 complex is required
cell-autonomously for axon guidance and growth cone filopodia initiation.
Furthermore, they show that two other actin-binding proteins, UNC-115/abLIM and
UNC-34/Enabled, also control growth cone filopodia formation, possibly in
parallel to Arp2/3. These studies indicate that, in vivo, multiple actin
modulatory pathways including the Arp2/3 complex contribute to growth cone
filopodia formation during growth cone outgrowth.

A cytochrome P450 class I electron transfer system from Novosphingobium
aromaticivorans.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes of the CYP101 and CYP111 families from
Novosphingobium aromaticivorans are heme monooxygenases that catalyze the
hydroxylation of a range of terpenoid compounds. CYP101D1 and CYP101D2 oxidized
camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. CYP101B1 and CYP101C1 oxidized beta-ionone to
predominantly 3-R-hydroxy-beta-ionone and 4-hydroxy-beta-ionone, respectively.
CYP111A2 oxidized linalool to 8-hydroxylinalool. Physiologically, these CYP
enzymes could receive electrons from Arx, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin equivalent to
putidaredoxin from the CYP101A1 system from Pseudomonas putida. A putative
ferredoxin reductase (ArR) in the N. aromaticivorans genome, with high amino acid
sequence homology to putidaredoxin reductase, has been over-produced in
Escherichia coli and found to support substrate oxidation by these CYP enzymes
via Arx with both high activity and coupling of product formation to NADH
consumption. The ArR/Arx electron-transport chain has been co-expressed with the 
CYP enzymes in an E. coli host to provide in vivo whole-cell substrate oxidation 
systems that could produce up to 6.0 g L(-1) of 5-exo-hydroxycamphor at rates of 
up to 64 microM (gram of cell dry weight)(-1) min(-1). These efficient
biocatalytic systems have potential uses in preparative scale whole-cell
biotransformations.

ARX mutations are associated with variable clinical phenotypes. We report a new
neurodegenerative phenotype associated with a known ARX mutation and causing
early abnormal neurodevelopment, a complex movement disorder, and early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy with a suppression-burst pattern (Ohtahara syndrome). A 
male infant presented at age 5 months with a dyskinetic movement disorder, which 
was initially diagnosed as infantile spasms. Clinical deterioration was
accompanied by progressive cortical atrophy with a reduction in white matter
volume and resulting in death in the first year of life; such a rapidly
progressive and severe phenotype has not previously been described. ARX mutation 
testing should be undertaken in children aged less than 1 year with Ohtahara
syndrome and a movement disorder, and in infants with unexplained
neurodegeneration, progressive white matter loss, and cortical atrophy.

Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene mutations cause a diverse spectrum of
disorders of the human brain, including lissencephaly, various forms of epilepsy 
and non-syndromic mental retardation. We have identified a novel mutation,
c.81C>G (p.Y27X), within the ARX gene in a family with two affected male cousins.
One of the boys was diagnosed with an early infantile epileptic encephalopathy
also known as Ohtahara syndrome, whereas his cousin had been diagnosed with West 
syndrome (WS). Both patients have normal genitalia and neither have
lissencephaly. The ARX mutation identified is predicted to yield a severely
truncated protein of only 26 amino acids and can be considered as a null
mutation. Somewhat surprisingly, however, it does not yield the X-linked
lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (XLAG) syndrome. We proposed that the ARX 
mRNA translation re-initiated at the next AUG codon at position c.121-123 (aa 41)
and, thus, partly rescued these patients from XLAG. Our in vitro studies show
that this N-terminally truncated ARX protein (p.M41_C562) is detected by western 
immunoblot in lysates from cells transiently transfected with an ARX
over-expression construct containing the c.81C>G mutation. Although these
findings widen the spectrum of clinical phenotypes because of mutations in the
ARX gene, they also emphasize the molecular pathogenetic effect of individual
mutations as well as the effect of genetic background resulting in intrafamilial 
clinical heterogeneity for these mutations.

BACKGROUND: Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) or Dravet syndrome (DS)
is a distinctive epilepsy syndrome often associated with de novo mutations in the
SCN1A gene. However, 25-30% patients with SMEI/DS are negative for SCN1A mutation
screening, suggesting that other molecular mechanisms may account for these
disorders. Given the overlapping and heterogeneous clinical features of CDKL5-
and ARX-related epilepsies and SMEI/DS, we postulated that CDKL5 mutations in
females and ARX mutations gene in males may be associated with early onset
seizures forms of SMEI/DS.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with early onset SMEI/DS before 6 months negative 
for SCN1A mutational screening were selected and screened for mutations in the
ARX gene in males (n=14) or the CDKL5 gene in females (n=14).
RESULTS: No mutations in either gene were found except one intronic variation of 
uncertain pathogenicity in the CDKL5 gene. All patients started seizures at mean 
age of 3.48 months. Thirteen patients had familial history of epilepsy or febrile
seizures. Patients evolved toward refractory epilepsy with generalized tonic
clonic seizures (18/28) and myoclonia (23/28) and severe neurological impairment 
with autistic features (13/28), ataxia (14/28) and spasticity (5/28). No patient 
ever exhibited infantile spasms, dystonia, or Rett-like features.
INTERPRETATIONS: Our results illustrate that mutation screening of ARX and CDKL5 
is not effective in patients selected on the basis of clinical signs associated
to early onset SMEI/DS. In addition, they might reflect that other phenotypic
features associated with CDKL5 mutations (Rett-like features, infantile spasm) or
ARX mutations (dystonia, spasticity) are more distinctive.

    Cell. 2009 Aug 7;138(3):424-6.

We have previously reported that the loss of Arx and/or Pax4 gene activity leads 
to a shift in the fate of the different endocrine cell subtypes in the mouse
pancreas, without affecting the total endocrine cell numbers. Here, we
conditionally and ectopically express Pax4 using different cell-specific
promoters and demonstrate that Pax4 forces endocrine precursor cells, as well as 
mature alpha cells, to adopt a beta cell destiny. This results in a glucagon
deficiency that provokes a compensatory and continuous glucagon+ cell neogenesis 
requiring the re-expression of the proendocrine gene Ngn3. However, the newly
formed alpha cells fail to correct the hypoglucagonemia since they subsequently
acquire a beta cell phenotype upon Pax4 ectopic expression. Notably, this cycle
of neogenesis and redifferentiation caused by ectopic expression of Pax4 in alpha
cells is capable of restoring a functional beta cell mass and curing diabetes in 
animals that have been chemically depleted of beta cells.

Arx acts as a regional key selector gene in the ventral telencephalon mainly
through its transcriptional repression activity.

The homeobox-containing gene Arx is expressed during ventral telencephalon
development and required for correct GABAergic interneuron tangential migration
from the ganglionic eminences to the olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex and
striatum. Its human ortholog is associated with a variety of neurological
clinical manifestations whose symptoms are compatible with the loss of cortical
interneurons and altered basal ganglia-related activities. Herein, we report the 
identification of a number of genes whose expression is consistently altered in
Arx mutant ganglionic eminences. Our analyses revealed a striking ectopic
expression in the ganglionic eminences of several of these genes normally at most
marginally expressed in the ventral telencephalon. Among them, Ebf3 was
functionally analyzed. Thus, its ectopic expression in ventral telencephalon was 
found to prevent neuronal tangential migration. Further, we showed that Arx is
sufficient to repress Ebf3 endogenous expression and that its silencing in Arx
mutant tissues partially rescues tangential cell movement. Together, these data
provide new insights into the molecular pathways regulated by Arx during
telencephalon development.

A novel de novo 27 bp duplication of the ARX gene, resulting from postzygotic
mosaicism and leading to three severely affected males in two generations.

The Aristaless Related Homeobox (ARX) gene is a Q(50) paired homeobox gene. These
genes are important regulators of essential events during vertebrate
embryogenesis, including the development of the central and peripheral nervous
system. Mutations in ARX have been identified in at least 82 different families
and sporadic cases, and are responsible for at least 8 clinically distinct
disorders. The recurrent 24 bp duplication (dup) mutation, c.429_452dup(24 bp),
is the most frequent ARX mutation, which accounts for 45% of all cases reported
to date. Here we report a novel de novo, familial dup mutation of 27 bp,
c.430_456dup(27 bp), which involves the same region of the ARX gene in exon 2, as
the dup24 bp mutation. The female progenitor of this dup27 bp allele exhibits
mosaicism, likely resulting from a postmitotic de novo mutation event early in
embryonic development. Three males with the dup27 bp mutation presented with
infantile spasms, two of whom died early in life. Their phenotype appeared more
severe, when compared to the spectrum of clinical presentations associated with
the dup24 bp mutation. We propose that this might be at least partly due to the
single, extra alanine residue (A) (21A in dup27 vs. 20A in dup24), which takes
polyalanine tract 2 of ARX beyond the maximum, naturally occurring limit of 20A
found in the human genome.

ARX (the aristaless-related homeobox gene) is a transcription factor that
participates in the development of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons in the
forebrain. Many ARX mutations have been identified in X-linked lissencephaly and 
mental retardation with epilepsy, and thus ARX is considered to be a causal gene 
for the two syndromes although the neurobiological functions of each mutation
remain unclear. We attempted to elucidate the causal relationships between
individual ARX mutations and disease phenotypes by generating a series of mutant 
mice. We generated three types of mice with knocked-in ARX mutations associated
with X-linked lissencephaly (P353R) and mental retardation [P353L and
333ins(GCG)7]. Mice with the P355R mutation (equivalent to the human 353
position) that died after birth were significantly different in Arx
transcript/protein amounts, GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal development, brain
morphology and lifespan from mice with P355L and 330ins(GCG)7 but considerably
similar to Arx-deficient mice with truncated ARX mutation in lissencephaly. Mice 
with the 330ins(GCG)7 mutation showed severe seizures and impaired learning
performance, whereas mice with the P355L mutation exhibited mild seizures and
only slightly impaired learning performance. Both types of mutant mice exhibited 
the mutation-specific lesser presence of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons in the
striatum, medial septum and ventral forebrain nuclei when compared with wild-type
mice. Present findings that reveal a causal relationship between ARX mutations
and the pleiotropic phenotype in mice, suggest that the ARX-related syndrome,
including lissencephaly or mental retardation, is caused by only the concerned
ARX mutations without the involvement of other genetic factors.

Comment in
    Epilepsy Curr. 2010 Jan;10(1):24-7.

Infantile spasms syndrome (ISS) is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with motor
spasms, persistent seizures, mental retardation, and in some cases, autism. One
of its monogenic causes is an insertion mutation [c.304ins (GCG)(7)] on the X
chromosome, expanding the first polyalanine tract of the interneuron-specific
transcription factor Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) from 16 to 23 alanine
codons. Null mutation of the Arx gene impairs GABA and cholinergic interneuronal 
migration but results in a neonatal lethal phenotype. We developed the first
viable genetic mouse model of ISS that spontaneously recapitulates salient
phenotypic features of the human triplet repeat expansion mutation.
Arx((GCG)10+7) ("Arx plus 7") pups display abnormal spasm-like myoclonus and
other key EEG features, including multifocal spikes, electrodecremental episodes,
and spontaneous seizures persisting into maturity. The neurobehavioral profile of
Arx mutants was remarkable for lowered anxiety, impaired associative learning,
and abnormal social interaction. Laminar decreases of Arx+ cortical interneurons 
and a selective reduction of calbindin-, but not parvalbumin- or
calretinin-expressing interneurons in neocortical layers and hippocampus indicate
that specific classes of synaptic inhibition are missing from the adult
forebrain, providing a basis for the seizures and cognitive disorder. A
significant reduction of calbindin-, NPY (neuropeptide Y)-expressing, and
cholinergic interneurons in the mutant striatum suggest that dysinhibition within
this network may contribute to the dyskinetic motor spasms. This mouse model
narrows the range of critical pathogenic elements within brain inhibitory
networks essential to recreate this complex neurodevelopmental syndrome.

Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder affecting young people. The
etiologies are multiple and most cases are sporadic. However, some rare families 
with Mendelian inheritance have provided evidence of genes' important role in
epilepsy. Two important but apparently different groups of disorders have been
extensively studied: epilepsies associated with malformations of cortical
development (MCDs) and epilepsies associated with a structurally normal brain (or
with minimal abnormalities only). This review is focused on clinical and
molecular aspects of focal cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria, periventricular
nodular heterotopia, subcortical band heterotopia, lissencephaly and
schizencephaly as examples of MCDs. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, childhood
absence epilepsy, some familial forms of focal epilepsy and epilepsies associated
with febrile seizures are discussed as examples of epileptic conditions in
(apparently) structurally normal brains.

Pathogenic variations of the ARX (aristaless-related homeobox) gene are
associated with marked phenotypic pleiotropy. These phenotypes are X-linked
neurological disorders that include brain and genital malformation and
non-malformation syndromes. Typically, malformation phenotypes result from
pathogenic variations that are predicted to truncate the ARX protein, or alter
residues in the highly conserved homeodomain. While non-malformation phenotypes
tend to be caused by pathogenic variations that are predicted to expand the first
two polyalanine tracts of ARX, or alter residues outside of the homeodomain. The 
most common pathogenic variation of the ARX gene is a duplication of 24 bp,
c.429_452 dup, which leads to an expansion of the second polyalanine tract of the
ARX protein from 12 to 20 alanine residues. This pathogenic variation is
associated with both sporadic and familial nonsyndromic mental retardation.
Syndromic manifestations include mental retardation with hand dystonia
(Partington syndrome), infantile spasms (West syndrome) and/or other epileptic
seizures. Here, we report on a novel pathogenic variant of a tandem 33 bp
duplication that is predicted to result in an expansion of polyalanine tract 2 in
two brothers with mental retardation, epilepsy, dystonia, and the novel feature
of intermittent hyperventilation. This pathogenic variation is predicted to
result in a "non-homogeneous" polyalanine tract expansion that is longer than
predicted expansion caused by the common 24 bp duplication. The location of the
novel 33 bp duplication in the same region as the common 24 bp duplication
supports this region as the ARX variation "hot spot."

Prospective evaluation of the time to peak effect of propofol to target the
effect site in children.

Muñoz HR(1), León PJ, Fuentes RS, Echevarría GC, Cortínez LI.

Author information: 
(1)Departamento de Anestesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad
Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

BACKGROUND: The plasma-effect site equilibration rate constant (k(e0)) of
propofol has been determined in children with the use of the time to maximum
effect (t(peak)), however, it has not been validated. The objective was to
measure the t(peak;) of propofol with two depths of anesthesia monitors in
children and to evaluate these measurements with a target-controlled infusion
(TCI) system.
METHODS: Unpremedicated, ASA I children from 3 to 11 years were studied. In Part 
1, children were monitored simultaneously with the bispectral index (BIS) and the
A-Line ARX-index (AAI) from the Alaris A-Line auditory-evoked potential
monitor/2. The t(peak) after a bolus dose of propofol was measured. In Part 2,
the t(peak) measured was used to target the effect site with a TCI system. The
median (MD) and the absolute median (MDA) difference between the predicted time
of peak concentration at the effect site (Ce) and the measured time of peak
effect in the index of depth of anesthesia (t(error)) was used to evaluate the
performance of the system.
RESULTS: The BIS recordings were of a better quality than the AAI. The mean +/-
standard deviation t(peak) was 65 +/- 14 s with the BIS (n=25) and 201 +/- 74 s
with the AAI (n=10)(P<0.001). Validation was only performed with the BIS monitor 
in 40 children, yielding an MD t(error) of -9.5 s and an MDA t(error) of 10.0 s.
CONCLUSIONS: The small delay between the evolution of Ce of propofol and the
observed effect suggests that this can be a useful model to target the effect
site in children.

The roles of multiple importins for nuclear import of murine aristaless-related
homeobox protein.

Nuclear import of proteins with nuclear localization signals (NLSs) is mediated
by shuttling carriers, the importins. Some cargoes display more than a single
NLS, and among these are homeodomain proteins such as Arx, which is critical for 
development of multiple tissues. Arx has two functional NLSs. The present studies
show that several pathways can import Arx via its NLS2, which is within its DNA
binding homeodomain. Using an in vitro nuclear import assay, we show that import 
of Arx via NLS2 can be mediated by importin beta1, importin 9, or importin 13,
with binding being strongest to importin beta1. All binding is sensitive to
RanGTP. Experiments based on precise domain deletions indicate that NLS2 binds
impbeta1, imp9, and imp13 and includes both an importin binding subdomain and a
regulatory subdomain with arginine residues being important for function.
Moreover, Arx can be co-precipitated with these importins when NLS2 is present.
Although nuclear import of Arx can be mediated by these three importin betas,
importin beta1 seems to play the major role judging from in vivo small
interfering RNA ablations and the in vitro import assay. This is the first
evidence to show the role of importin beta1 in nuclear import of paired-type
homeodomain proteins. We propose a novel and possibly quite general mechanism for
nuclear import of paired-type homeodomain proteins which is critical for
development.

Infantile spasms is a developmental epilepsy syndrome with unique clinical and
EEG features, a specific pattern of pharmacological responsiveness, and poor
outcome in terms of cognition and epilepsy. Despite the devastating nature of
infantile spasms, little is known about its pathogenesis. Until recently, there
has been no animal model available to investigate the pathophysiology of the
syndrome or to generate and test novel therapies. Now, several promising animal
models have emerged, spanning the etiological spectrum from genetic causes (e.g.,
Down syndrome or Aristaless-related homeobox [ARX] mutation) to acquired causes
(e.g., endogenous and exogenous toxins or stress hormones with convulsant
activity or blockade of neural activity). These new models are discussed in this 
review, with emphasis on the insights each can provide for understanding,
treating, and preventing infantile spasms.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective symptomatic treatment in Parkinson's
disease. High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus elicits
neurotransmitter release in multiple nuclei. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis 
that neurotransmitter release during HFS may be used to provide feedback control 
of the intensity and pattern of HFS. We studied the dynamic relationship between 
extracellular glutamate levels and HFS in and around the STN in anesthetized
rats. We used a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) of stimulation in the STN,
the independent forcing function, while measuring extracellular glutamate in the 
same nucleus, the dependent variable. The PRBS consisted of 90 s periods during
which stimulation (100 microA, 150Hz, 10% duty cycle) was either off or on. The
stimulation and extracellular glutamate levels were fitted using an
autoregressive exogenous model (ARX) to determine the transfer function between
HFS and the extracellular glutamate concentration in the STN. The ARX model fit
the dynamics of extracellular glutamate levels well (correlation coefficients
ranged from 0.74 to 0.99; n=11). The transfer function accurately predicted
extracellular glutamate levels in the STN even when the pattern of HFS was
modified. We used the transfer function to develop a feedback controlled
stimulation algorithm. Feedback controlled HFS maintained extracellular glutamate
concentrations at any predefined level, but only intermittent HFS was required.
We conclude that the transfer function between HFS and neurotransmitter levels in
the brain can be used to design DBS protocols that generate specific temporal
patterns of glutamate release in the STN.

Comment in
    Epilepsy Curr. 2010 Jan;10(1):24-7.

Mutations in the X-linked aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) have been linked
to structural brain anomalies as well as multiple neurocognitive deficits. The
generation of Arx-deficient mice revealed several morphological anomalies,
resembling those observed in patients and an interneuron migration defect but
perinatal lethality precluded analyses of later phenotypes. Interestingly, many
of the neurological phenotypes observed in patients with various ARX mutations
can be attributed, in part, to interneuron dysfunction. To directly test this
possibility, mice carrying a floxed Arx allele were generated and crossed to
Dlx5/6(CRE-IRES-GFP)(Dlx5/6(CIG)) mice, conditionally deleting Arx from
ganglionic eminence derived neurons including cortical interneurons. We now
report that Arx(-/y);Dlx5/6(CIG) (male) mice exhibit a variety of seizure types
beginning in early-life, including seizures that behaviourally and
electroencephalographically resembles infantile spasms, and show evolution
through development. Thus, this represents a new genetic model of a malignant
form of paediatric epilepsy, with some characteristics resembling infantile
spasms, caused by mutations in a known infantile spasms gene. Unexpectedly,
approximately half of the female mice carrying a single mutant Arx allele
(Arx(-/+);Dlx5/6(CIG)) also developed seizures. We also found that a subset of
human female carriers have seizures and neurocognitive deficits. In summary, we
have identified a previously unrecognized patient population with neurological
deficits attributed to ARX mutations that are recapitulated in our mouse model.
Furthermore, we show that perturbation of interneuron subpopulations is an
important mechanism underling the pathogenesis of developmental epilepsy in both 
hemizygous males and carrier females. Given the frequency of ARX mutations in
patients with infantile spasms and related disorders, our data unveil a new model
for further understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders.

Mono- and binuclear Fischer carbene complexes, [M(CO)5{C(OR)Ar-ArX}], X = H,
{C(OR)M'(CO)5}; M, M' = W or Cr; R = Me, Et or (CH2)4OMe; Ar = thiophene,
N-methylpyrrole or furan units 1-20, were synthesized. For this purpose, mono-,
bi- or stepwise lithiated bithiophene, N,N'-dimethylbipyrrole, thienylfuran and
N-methyl(thienyl)pyrrole were reacted with chromium and tungsten hexacarbonyl
precursors. Dilithiation in the 2- and 9-positions of N-methyl(thienyl)pyrrole
could not be achieved. Alkylation of acyl metallates with triethyloxonium
tetrafluoroborate or methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate in THF afforded not only
the expected carbene complexes with ethoxy or methoxy substituents, but in the
case of bithiophene with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, carbene complexes with
alkoxy substituents incorporating a ring-opened tetrahydrofuran moiety. X-Ray
crystallographic structure determinations were performed on
[W(CO)5{C(OMe)(thienylfuran)}] (14), [W(CO)5{C(OMe)(N-methylthienylpyrrole)}]
(20) and [{W(CO)5}2{mu-C(OEt)(N,N'-dimethylbipyrrolylC(OEt)}] (12) to assess the 
role of the heterobiaryl substituent on the structural features of the carbene
ligand in the complexes. Complexes [{Cr(CO)5}2{mu-C(OMe)bithienylC(OEt)}] (3),
[(CO)5Cr{mu-C(OMe)bithienylC(OMe)}W(CO)5] (5) and [{Cr(CO)5}2
{mu-C(OMe)thienylfuranC-(OMe)}] (15) were reacted with 3-hexyne to study their
behaviour in benzannulation reactions. The major products generated by the
biscarbene complexes were regio-selectively determined by the nature of the metal
site and that of the heteroatom in the arene rings. The monocarbene complexes
[Cr(CO)5{C(OMe)thienylfuran] (13) and [Cr(CO)5{C(OEt)(N-methylthienylpyrrole)}]
(19) were refluxed in THF for 2 hours in the presence of [Pd(PPh4)4] to afforded 
the carbene-carbene coupled olefinic products and small amounts of the
corresponding 2-ethyl(biheteroaryl)acetate. By contrast, the biscarbene complex
of thienylfuran (15), afforded only the 2,9-diester of thienylfuran.

A coherent green fluorescence was obtained by butylation at the 2-position of
panchromatic 2,3-diaryl-5,8-diarylquinoxalines (2) to give corresponding
2-butyl-2,3-diaryl-5,8-diaryl-1H-quinoxalines (3). Full color quinoxaline
derivatives (2) were prepared from electronic modification at either the 2,3- or 
5,8-positions at the peripheral ArX group or X group (X = -H, -OMe, -NPh(2),
-NMe(2), -NMePh) of the quinoxalines. 2-Butylation converted one imine unit of
the pyrazine ring to an amine group, which effectively altered the electron donor
and acceptor functions to produce a coherent green fluorescence.

Dental School, Valencia, Spain.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to establish the midterm prognosis of
periapical surgery by use of the ultrasound technique, comparing a scale obtained
by image analysis with the success rates according to other prognostic scales.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical follow-up study was performed between September
2004 and September 2005. Thirty-six patients with chronic periapical lesions were
treated with periapical surgery via the ultrasound technique and root-end filling
with silver amalgam. Evolution was analyzed by use of the different currently
accepted assessment scales at 6 and 12 months after intervention with a scale
obtained by radiographic image analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty patients with a mean age of 40.5 years were studied. The mean
follow-up period was 14.2 months. Thirty-seven lesions were analyzed. A positive 
correlation at 6 months was observed between the radiographic scale proposed in
this study and the scales of Rud and Andreasen and von Arx et al. At 12 months,
the proposed radiographic scale only correlated with the functional tooth concept
established by Friedman.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant relation between the
radiographic scale from the image analyzer and the criteria of Rud and Andreasen 
and von Arx et al.

between prethalamus and thalamus through mutual antagonism with the anterior
repressors Fezf and Arx.

The Iroquois (Irx) genes encode homeoproteins conserved during evolution.
Vertebrate genomes contain six Irx genes organized in two clusters, IrxA (which
harbors Irx1, Irx2 and Irx4) and IrxB (which harbors Irx3, Irx5 and Irx6). To
determine the precise role of these genes during development and their putative
redundancies, we conducted a comparative expression analysis and a comprehensive 
loss-of-function study of all the early expressed Irx genes (Irx1-5) using
specific morpholinos in Xenopus. We found that the five Irx genes display largely
overlapping expression patterns and contribute to neural patterning. All Irx
genes are required for proper formation of posterior forebrain, midbrain,
hindbrain and, to a lesser an extent, spinal cord. Nevertheless, Irx1 and Irx3
seem to have a predominant role during regionalization of the neural plate. In
addition, we find that the common anterior limit of Irx gene expression, which
will correspond to the future border between the prethalamus and thalamus, is
defined by mutual repression between Fezf and Irx proteins. This mutual
repression is likely direct. Finally, we show that Arx, another anteriorly
expressed repressor, also contribute to delineate the anterior border of Irx
expression.

Neuronal migration disorders.

Guerrini R(1), Parrini E.

Hospital A. Meyer, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. r.guerrini@meyer.it

Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration
disorders (NMDs) causing severe, global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of
the LIS1, DCX, ARX, TUBA1A and RELN genes have been associated with these
malformations. NMDs only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical
band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, cause neurological and
cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. They have been
associated with abnormalities of the DCX, FLN1A, and ARFGEF2 genes.
Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is
inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized
polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including
disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically
heterogeneous and only in a small minority of patients a definite genetic cause
has been identified. Mutations of the GPR56 and SRPX2 genes have been related to 
isolated polymicrogyria. Focal migration abnormalities associated with abnormal
cell types, such as focal cortical dysplasia, are highly epileptogenic and
variably influence the functioning of the affected cortex. The functional
consequences of abnormal neuronal migration are still poorly understood.
Conservation of function in the malformed cortex, its atypical representation,
and relocation outside the malformed area are all possible. Localization of
function based on anatomic landmarks may not be reliable.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of
Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.

We describe two new familial severe infantile spasm syndromes (ISSs) unrelated to
Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene mutation. Family A contains two male
siblings each with dysmorphism, profound psychomotor delay, gastroesophageal
reflux, infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, prominent independent central apneas,
and early death. Family B contains two male siblings with dysmorphism, profound
psychomotor delay, ambiguous genitalia, macular hypoplasia, neurosensory hearing 
deficit, gastroesophageal reflux, infantile spasms, no hypsarrhythmia, apneas,
and early death in one sibling. Etiologic workup and ARX gene sequencing were
negative. This indicates that several familial ISSs exist but are not genetically
characterized.

The cell migration molecule UNC-53/NAV2 is linked to the ARP2/3 complex by ABI-1.

The shape changes that are required to position a cell to migrate or grow out in 
a particular direction involve a coordinated reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton. Although it is known that the ARP2/3 complex nucleates actin
filament assembly, exactly how the information from guidance cues is integrated
to elicit ARP2/3-mediated remodeling during outgrowth remains vague. Previous
studies have shown that C. elegans UNC-53 and its vertebrate homolog NAV
(Neuronal Navigators) are required for the migration of cells and neuronal
processes. We have identified ABI-1 as a novel molecular partner of UNC-53/NAV2
and have found that a restricted calponin homology (CH) domain of UNC-53 is
sufficient to bind ABI-1. ABI-1 and UNC-53 have an overlapping expression
pattern, and display similar cell migration phenotypes in the excretory cell, and
in mechanosensory and motoneurons. Migration defects were also observed after
RNAi of proteins known to function with abi-1 in actin dynamics, including nck-1,
wve-1 and arx-2. We propose that UNC-53/NAV2, through its CH domain, acts as a
scaffold that links ABI-1 to the ARP2/3 complex to regulate actin cytoskeleton
remodeling.

Noninvasive portable sensors are becoming popular in biomedical engineering
practice due to its ease of use. This paper investigates the estimation of human 
oxygen uptake (VO(2)) of treadmill exercises by using multiple portable sensors
(wireless heart rate sensor and triaxial accelerometers). For this purpose, a
multivariable Hammerstein model identification method is developed. Well designed
PRBS type of exercises protocols are employed to decouple the identification of
linear dynamics with that of nonlinearities of Hammerstein systems. The support
vector machine regression is applied to model the static nonlinearities.
Multivariable ARX modelling approach is used for the identification of dynamic
part of the Hammerstein systems. It is observed the obtained nonlinear
multivariable model can achieve better estimations compared with single input
single output models. The established multivariable model has also the potential 
to facilitate dynamic estimation of energy expenditure for outdoor exercises,
which is the next research step of this study.

Neuronal migration disorders: clinical, neuroradiologic and genetics aspects.

Sapienza, Italy.

Disorders of neuronal migration are a heterogeneous group of disorders of nervous
system development. One of the most frequent disorders is lissencephaly,
characterized by a paucity of normal gyri and sulci resulting in a 'smooth
brain'. There are two pathologic subtypes: classical and cobblestone. Six
different genes could be responsible for this entity (LIS1, DCX, TUBA1A, VLDLR,
ARX, RELN), although co-delection of YWHAE gene with LIS1 could result in
Miller-Dieker Syndrome. Heterotopia is defined as a cluster of normal neurons in 
abnormal locations, and divided into three main groups: periventricular nodular
heterotopia, subcortical heterotopia and marginal glioneural heterotopia.
Genetically, heterotopia is related to Filamin A (FLNA) or ADP-ribosylation
factor guanine exchange factor 2 (ARFGEF2) genes mutations. Polymicrogyria is
described as an augmentation of small circonvolutions separated by shallow
enlarged sulci; bilateral frontoparietal form is characterized by bilateral,
symmetric polymicrogyria in the frontoparietal regions. Bilateral perisylvian
polymicrogyria results in a clinical syndrome manifested by mild mental
retardation, epilepsy and pseudobulbar palsy. Gene mutations linked to this
disorder are SRPX2, PAX6, TBR2, KIAA1279, RAB3GAP1 and COL18A1. Schizencephaly,
consisting in a cleft of cerebral hemisphere connecting extra-axial subaracnoid
spaces and ventricles, is another important disorder of neuronal migration whose 
clinical characteristics are extremely variable. EMX2 gene could be implicated in
its genesis. Focal cortical dysplasia is characterized by three different types
of altered cortical laminations, and represents one of most severe cause of
epilepsy in children. TSC1 gene could play a role in its etiology.CONCLUSION:
This review reports the main clinical, genetical and neuroradiological aspects of
these disorders. It is hoped that accumulating data of the development mechanisms
underlying the expanded network formation in the brain will lead to the
development of therapeutic options for neuronal migration disorders.

Influence of glyphosate, crop volunteer and root pathogens on
glyphosate-resistant wheat under controlled environmental conditions.

99164-6420, USA.

BACKGROUND: The herbicide glyphosate has a synergistic effect on root disease
because of increased susceptibility from reduced plant defenses resulting from
the blockage of the shikimic acid pathway. Could glyphosate-resistant (GR) wheat 
cultivars and glyphosate application in-crop increase the risk of damage from
soil-borne pathogens? Growth chamber experiments were conducted with two GR wheat
lines and their corresponding glyphosate-sensitive (GS) parents and four
pathogens (Rhizoctonia solani Kühn R. oryzae Ryker & Gooch, Gaeumannomyces
graminis (Sacc.) v. Arx & J. Olivier var. tritici J. Walker and Pythium ultimum
Trow). Treatments consisted of different herbicide timings and planting of crop
volunteer to mimic management practices in the field.
RESULTS: GR cultivars were not inherently more susceptible to root pathogens than
GS cultivars, and application of glyphosate did not increase root disease. When
crop volunteer was grown in close proximity to GR cultivars, the timing of
glyphosate application had a profound effect. In general, the longer the crop
volunteer was left before killing with glyphosate, the greater was the
competitive effect on the planted crop. Both R. solani and G. graminis var.
tritici reduced plant height, number of tillers and root length of the GR
cultivars in the presence of crop volunteer with glyphosate application.
CONCLUSION: To minimize the damaging effects of these pathogens, producers should
apply glyphosate at least 2-3 weeks before planting GR wheat, as currently
advised for GS cereals.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the indices computed by a bispectral (BIS) monitor and an 
auditory evoked potential (AEP) monitor during maintenance of anesthesia in
pediatric patients. A secondary objective was to compare anesthetic consumption
and recovery times.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients aged 6 months to 12 years under inhaled anesthesia
with sevoflurane were administered a penile or caudal nerve block. BIS and AEP
monitoring was then started. The patients were randomized to 3 groups in which
the sevoflurane dosage was guided by the BIS index, the A-line ARX index (AAI),
or standard procedures (control group). The BIS index, the AAI, the fraction of
expired sevoflurane, hemodynamic parameters, and recovery time were the variables
recorded for all patients.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled. Significant differences between the 
2 monitor groups were observed. The mean (SD) AAI was lower in patients whose
dosage was controlled by the BIS index (19 [2]) than in those whose dosage was
based on the AEP monitor's reading (22 [4]) (P=.04). According to a Bland and
Altman plot, there was good agreement between the BIS index and the AAI except
for the highest and, in particular, the lowest values. The volumes of sevoflurane
used and the recovery times were similar between groups. There was a positive
correlation between the 2 indices (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.207;
P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: BIS monitoring provided a more stable index than did AEP monitoring 
and BIS-index guidance achieved a deeper level of hypnosis. There was good
correlation between the 2 indices during maintenance of anesthesia. Neither
monitor offered advantages over standard procedures with regard to movement,
volume of anesthetic consumed, or recovery time.

INTRODUCTION: Mental retardation has an approximated prevalence of 2% in the
general population and its most frequent cause is X-fragile syndrome. This
genetic disorder predominantly affects males and it is mainly caused by the
expansion of CGG in FMR1 gene. Recently has been demonstrated that mutations in a
new called ARX gene (aristaless-related homeobox) can also cause a similar form
of X linked mental retardation, as well as other neurological disorders (autism, 
Partington or West syndrome). The most frequent mutation that has been reported
is the c.428_451 dup24, which comprises almost 60% of all described. It causes an
expansion of a polyalanine tract of ARX protein.
CASE REPORTS: We report three cases of mental retardation in two different
families where the mutation in ARX gene c.428_451 dup24 was found while X-fragile
syndrome screening was made. Personal and familiar history, phenotype and
evolution are described.
CONCLUSION: The molecular analysis of this mutation should be considered as a
routine for the genetic diagnosis of mental retardation in males of nondrafted
cause.

Comment in
    Neurology. 2009 Feb 3;72(5):394-5.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the involvement of the midbrain and hindbrain (MHB) in
the groups of classic (cLIS), variant (vLIS), and cobblestone complex (CBSC)
lissencephalies and to determine whether a correlation exists between the
cerebral malformation and the MHB abnormalities.
METHODS: MRI scans of 111 patients (aged 1 day to 32 years; mean 5 years 4
months) were retrospectively reviewed. After reviewing the brain involvement on
MRI, the cases were reclassified according to known mutation (LIS1, DCX, ARX,
VLDLR, RELN, MEB, WWS) or mutation phenotype (LIS1-P, DCX-P, RELN-P, ARX-P,
VLDLR-P) determined on the basis of characteristic MRI features. Abnormalities in
the MHB were then recorded. For each structure, a score was assigned, ranging
from 0 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal). The differences between defined groups 
and the correlation between the extent of brain agyria/pachygyria and MHB
involvement were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) McNemar tests.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in MHB appearance among the three
major groups of cLIS, vLIS, and CBSC. The overall score showed a severity
gradient of MHB involvement: cLIS (0 or 1), vLIS (7), and CBSC (11 or 12). The
extent of cerebral lissencephaly was significantly correlated with the severity
of MHB abnormalities (p = 0.0029).
CONCLUSION: Our study focused on posterior fossa anomalies, which are an integral
part of cobblestone complex lissencephalies but previously have not been well
categorized for other lissencephalies. According to our results and the review of
the literature, we propose a new classification of human lissencephalies.

OBJECTIVES: Autism (MIM#209850) and schizophrenia (MIM#181500) are both
neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders characterized by a highly genetic
component. Homeogenes and forkhead genes encode transcription factors, which have
been involved in brain development and cell differentiation. Thus, they are
relevant candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have reported
an association between autism and DLX2, HOXA1, EN2, ARX, and FOXP2 genes whereas 
only three studies of EN2, OTX2, and FOXP2 were performed on schizophrenia.
Interestingly, most of these candidate genes contain trinucleotide repeats coding
for polyamino acid stretch in which instability can be the cause of
neurodevelopmental disorders. Our goal was to identify variations of coding
trinucleotide repeats in schizophrenia, autism, and idiopathic mental
retardation.
METHODS: We screened the coding trinucleotide repeats of OTX1, EN1, DLX2, HOXA1, 
and FOXP2 genes in populations suffering from schizophrenia (247 patients),
autism (98 patients), and idiopathic mental retardation (56 patients), and
compared them with control populations (112 super controls and 202 healthy
controls).
RESULTS: Novel deletions and insertions of coding trinucleotide repeats were
found in the DLX2, HOXA1, and FOXP2 genes. Most of these variations were detected
in controls and no difference in their distribution was observed between patient 
and control groups. Two different polymorphisms in FOXP2 were, however, found
only in autistic patients and the functional consequences of these variations of 
repeats have to be characterized and correlated to particular clinical features.
CONCLUSION: This study did not identify specific disease risk variants of
trinucleotide repeats in OTX1, EN1, DLX2, HOXA1, and FOXP2 candidate genes in
neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.

xArx2: an aristaless homolog that regulates brain regionalization during
development in Xenopus laevis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario,
Canada.

The aristaless-related gene, Arx, plays a fundamental role in patterning the
brain in humans and mice. Arx mutants exhibit lissencephaly among other
anomalies. We have cloned a Xenopus aristaless homolog that appears to define
specific regions of the developing forebrain. xArx2 is transcribed in blastula
through neurula stages, and comes to be restricted to the ventral and lateral
telencephalon, lateral diencephalon, neural floor plate of the anterior spinal
cord, and somites. In this respect, Arx2 expresses in regions similar to Arx with
the exception of the somites. Overexpression enlarges the telencephalon, and
interference by means of antisense morpholino-mediated translation knockdown
reduces growth of this area. Overexpression and inhibition studies demonstrate
that misregulation of xArx2 imposes dire consequences upon patterns of
differentiation not only in the forebrain where the gene normally expresses, but 
also in more caudal brain territories and derivatives as well. This suggests that
evolutionary changes that expanded Arx-expression from ventral to dorsal
prosencephalon might be one of the determinants that marked development and
expansion of the telencephalon.

Mental retardation is a serious social problem. It affects 2-3% of the
population. It is estimated that mutations in the ARX gene can be found in 1 in
12,000 live male births. This is the second most common cause of X-linked mental 
retardation after fragile X syndrome. The ARX gene belongs to transcription
factors involved in differentiation of specific neuronal cells in the central
nervous system. The most common mutation in the ARX gene is c. 428_451dup24,
duplication of 24 bp in exon 2 of the gene, causing elongation of the second
alanine tract (polyA12_II). Described disorders caused by mutations in the ARX
gene include: hydrocephaly with abnormal genitalia (HYD-AG), lissencephaly with
abnormal genitalia (XLAG), agenesis of corpus callosum with abnormal genitalia
(ACC-AG), Partington syndrome (PRTS), X-linked infantile spasms (ISSX), myoclonic
epilepsy with spasticity and mental retardation (XMESID), and nonspecific mental 
retardation (NS-XLMR).

BACKGROUND: The electroencephalogram-derived Bispectral Index (BIS), and the
composite A-line ARX index (cAAI), derived from the electroencephalogram and
auditory evoked potentials, have been promoted as anesthesia depth monitors.
Using an intraoperative wake-up test, we compared the performance of both indices
in distinguishing different hypnotic states, as evaluated by the University of
Michigan Sedation Scale, in children and adolescents during propofol-remifentanil
anesthesia for scoliosis surgery. Postoperative explicit recall was also
evaluated.
METHODS: Twenty patients (aged 10-20 yr) were enrolled. Prediction probabilities 
were calculated for induction, wake-up test, and emergence. BIS and cAAI were
compared at the start of the wake-up test, at purposeful movement to command, and
after the patient was reanesthetized. During the wake-up test, patients were
instructed to remember a color, and were then interviewed for explicit recall.
RESULTS: Prediction probabilities of BIS and cAAI for induction were 0.82 and
0.63 (P < 0.001), for the wake-up test, 0.78 and 0.79 (P < 0.001), and 0.74 and
0.78 for emergence (P < 0.001). During the wake-up test, a significant increase
in mean BIS and cAAI (P < 0.05) was demonstrated at purposeful movement, followed
by a significant decline after reintroduction of anesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS: During induction, BIS performed better than cAAI. Although cAAI was 
statistically a better discriminator for the level of consciousness during the
wake-up test and emergence, these differences do not appear to be clinically

The Arx transcription factor is expressed in the developing ventral telencephalon
and subsets of its derivatives. Mutation of human ARX ortholog causes
neurological disorders including epilepsy, lissencephaly, and mental retardation.
We have isolated the mouse Arx endogenous enhancer modules that control its
tightly compartmentalized forebrain expression. Interestingly, they are scattered
downstream of its coding region and partially included within the introns of the 
downstream PolA1 gene. These enhancers are ultraconserved noncoding sequences
that are highly conserved throughout the vertebrate phylum. Functional
characterization of the Arx GABAergic enhancer element revealed its strict
dependence on the activity of Dlx transcription factors. Dlx overexpression
induces ectopic expression of endogenous Arx and its isolated enhancer, whereas
loss of Dlx expression results in reduced Arx expression, suggesting that Arx is 
a key mediator of Dlx function. To further elucidate the mechanisms involved, a
combination of gain-of-function studies in mutant Arx or Dlx tissues was pursued.
This analysis provided evidence that, although Arx is necessary for the
Dlx-dependent promotion of interneuron migration, it is not required for the
GABAergic cell fate commitment mediated by Dlx factors. Although Arx has
additional functions independent of the Dlx pathway, we have established a direct
genetic relationship that controls critical steps in the development of
telencephalic GABAergic neurons. These findings contribute elucidating the
genetic hierarchy that likely underlies the etiology of a variety of human
neurodevelopmental disorders.

X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) is characterized by
lissencephaly, absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia. We examined
hypothalamic dysfunctions in a XLAG case with a novel mutation of the ARX gene,
and performed immunohistochemical evaluation of the diencephalons in autopsy
brain. A 1-year-old boy showed intractable epilepsy, persistent diarrhea and
disturbed temperature regulation. This case had abnormalities in circadian
rhythms and pituitary hormone reserve test. He died of pneumonia. The globus
pallidus and subthalamic nucleus was not identified, and the putamen and thalamus
were dysplasic. The suprachiasmatic nucleus was absent. A few neurons
immunoreactive for vasopressin seemed to form the ectopic supraoptic-like
nucleus. The diencephalons were disturbed differently in each sub-region, and the
changes may be related to various hypothalamic dysfunctions.

The function of the Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) gene product as a
transcriptional repressor is diminished by mutations associated with X-linked
mental retardation (XLMR).

Biological Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.

The Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) is mutated in patients with X-linked mental
retardation and a range of other neurological diseases. The molecular
consequences of these mutations are unclear. Here, we show that two
disease-associated mutations disrupt the function of Arx as a transcriptional
repressor. We found that Arx contains two independent repression domains: an
N-terminal octapeptide motif/engrailed homology domain and a novel domain located
in the C-terminus. The octapeptide motif functions through interaction with
members of the Groucho family of co-repressors. The C-terminal domain functions
through interaction with C-terminal binding protein (CtBP).

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are associated with
pleiotropic phenotypes including infantile spasms, mental retardation and
dystonia. However, relatively consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have
been emphasized in prior reports. We report a boy presenting with mental
retardation, tonic seizures and dystonia but without infantile spasms. Gene
sequencing detected an additional seven GCG repeats in the first polyalanine
tract of the ARX gene, a mutation which leads to an expansion of the normal 16
alanine residues to 23. The same ARX gene mutation has been reported in patients 
with infantile spasms, but was absent in the present case. This finding
highlights the diverse phenotypic spectrum that may result from ARX gene
mutations.

Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a major cause of
developmental disabilities and severe epilepsy. Advances in imaging and genetics 
have improved the diagnosis and classification of these conditions. Up to now,
eight genes have been involved in different types of MCD.
Lissencephaly-pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) represent a
malformative spectrum resulting from mutations of either LIS1 or DCX genes. LIS1 
mutations cause a more severe malformation in the posterior brain regions. DCX
mutations usually cause anteriorly predominant lissencephaly in males and SBH in 
female patients. Additional forms are X-linked lissencephaly with corpus callosum
agenesis and ambiguous genitalia associated with mutations of the ARX gene.
Lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH) encompass heterogeneous disorders 
named LCH type a to d. LCHa are related with mutation in LIS1 or DCX, LCHb with
mutation of RELN gene, and LCHd could be related with TUBA1A gene. Polymicrogyria
encompass a wide range of clinical, aetiological and histological findings. Among
several syndromes, recessive bilateral fronto-parietal polymicrogyria has been
associated with mutations of the GPR56 gene. Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria
showed a linkage to chromosome Xq28 in some pedigrees, and mutations in SRPX2
gene in others conditions. X-linked bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia
(BPNH) consists of BPNH with focal epilepsy in females and prenatal lethality in 
males. Filamin A (FLNA) mutations have been reported in some families and in
sporadic patients. It is possible to infer the most likely causative gene by
brain imaging studies and other clinical findings. Based on this experience, a
detailed phenotype analysis is needed to develop the most efficient research on
MCD in the future.

Mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are associated with
multiple neurologic disorders in humans. Studies in mice indicate Arx plays a
role in neuronal progenitor proliferation and development of the cerebral cortex,
thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and olfactory bulbs. Specific defects associated
with Arx loss of function include abnormal interneuron migration and subtype
differentiation. How disruptions in ARX result in human disease and how loss of
Arx in mice results in these phenotypes remains poorly understood. To gain
insight into the biological functions of Arx, we performed a genome-wide
expression screen to identify transcriptional changes within the subpallium in
the absence of Arx. We have identified 84 genes whose expression was dysregulated
in the absence of Arx. This population was enriched in genes involved in cell
migration, axonal guidance, neurogenesis, and regulation of transcription and
includes genes implicated in autism, epilepsy, and mental retardation; all
features recognized in patients with ARX mutations. Additionally, we found Arx
directly repressed three of the identified transcription factors: Lmo1, Ebf3 and 
Shox2. To further understand how the identified genes are involved in neural
development, we used gene set enrichment algorithms to compare the Arx gene
regulatory network (GRN) to the Dlx1/2 GRN and interneuron transcriptome. These
analyses identified a subset of genes in the Arx GRN that are shared with that of
the Dlx1/2 GRN and that are enriched in the interneuron transcriptome. These data
indicate Arx plays multiple roles in forebrain development, both dependent and
independent of Dlx1/2, and thus provides further insights into the understanding 
of the mechanisms underlying the pathology of mental retardation and epilepsy
phenotypes resulting from ARX mutations.

Kinetic and energetic analysis of the free electron transfer.

Author information: 
(1)Interdisciplinary Group Time-Resolved Spectroscopy, University of Leipzig,
Permoserstrasse 15, 04303 Leipzig, Germany.

In this paper, the bimolecular free (unhindered) electron transfer (FET) from
various trityl-containing compounds to the solvent radical cations of n-BuCl is
described. In good agreement with the previously studied cases, the FET involving
trityl-derived compounds results in the formation of two different types of the
radical cation, which undergo the subsequent fragmentation via two alternative
reaction channels. This unusual effect is caused by the intramolecular rotational
motion in the ground-state molecules around the arrow-marked bond Ar-//-X-CPh 3
(Ar = aromatic moiety; X = S, O, NH, CH 2), since such oscillations are directly 
connected with the electron distribution within the molecule. An unhindered
electron jump from the donor trityl compound to the solvent radical cation,
taking place in the subfemtosecond time range, generates the solute radical
cation with the inherited geometry and the electron distribution of its
precursor. Among the whole variety of produced radical cations, two extreme
conformer states can be distinguished, namely, a planar and a twisted state. The 
planar type represents the structures with minimum energy, whereas the twisted
type is destabilized by the increased value of the rotational barrier in the
ionized state. The difference in the energetic profiles between planar and
twisted radical cations plays a crucial role in their subsequent fragmentation.
The planar radical cation follows the thermodynamically favored pathway
generating ArX (*) and Ph 3C (+). A distinct part of the twisted radical cation
dissociates faster than it relaxes into the more preferable planar conformation
and, therefore, produces a thermodynamically unfavorable couple of products: ArX 
(+) and Ph 3C (*). This fragmentation channel is exclusively caused by FET. The
undertaken quantum chemical calculations enable the judgment of the energetics of
the different dissociation channels of the radical cations of the trityl
derivatives.

Promoting ectopic pancreatic fates: pancreas development and future diabetes
therapies.

Montréal, Québec, Canada.

Diabetes is a disease that could be treated more effectively with a better
understanding of pancreas development. This review examines the role of master
regulator genes driving crucial steps in pancreas development, from foregut
specification to differentiation of the five endocrine cell types. The roles of
Pdx1, Ptf1a, and Ngn3 are particularly examined as they are both necessary and
sufficient for promoting pancreatic cell fates (Pdx1, Ptf1a) and endocrine cell
development (Ngn3). The roles of Arx and Pax4 are studied as they compose part of
the regulatory mechanism balancing development of different types of endocrine
cells within the iselts and promote the development of alpha/PP and beta/delta
cell progenitors, respectively. The roles of the aforementioned genes, and the
consequences of misexpression of them for functionality of the pancreas, are
examined through recent studies in model organisms, particularly Xenopus and
zebrafish. Recent developments in cell replacement therapy research are also
covered, concentrating on stem cell research (coaxing both adult and embryonic
stem cells toward a beta cell fate) and transdifferentiation (generating beta
cells from other differentiated cell types).

Expression of Groucho/TLE proteins during pancreas development.

Avenue, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada. bhoffman@bccrc.ca

BACKGROUND: The full-length mammalian homologs of groucho, Tle1, 2, 3, and 4, act
as transcriptional corepressors and are recruited by transcription factors
containing an eh1 or WRPW/Y domain. Many transcription factors critical to
pancreas development contain a Gro/TLE interaction domain and several have been
shown to require Gro/TLE interactions for proper function during neuronal
development. However, a detailed analysis of the expression patterns of the
Gro/TLE proteins in pancreas development has not been performed. Moreover, little
is known about the ability of Gro/TLE proteins to interact with transcription
factors in the pancreas.
RESULTS: We describe the expression of Gro/TLE family members, and of 34
different transcription factors that contain a Gro/TLE interaction motif, in the 
pancreas utilizing nine SAGE libraries created from the developing and adult
pancreas, as well as the GenePaint database. Next, we show the dynamic expression
of Tle1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 during pancreas development by qRT-PCR. To further
define the cell-type specificity of the expression of these proteins we use
immunofluorescence to co-localize them with Pdx1 at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5),
Ngn3 at E14.5, Pdx1, Nkx2-2, Insulin, Glucagon, Pancreatic polypeptide and
Somatostatin at E18.5, as well as Insulin and Glucagon in the adult. We then show
that Tle2 can interact with Nkx2-2, Hes1, Arx, and Nkx6-1 which are all critical 
factors in pancreas development. Finally, we demonstrate that Tle2 modulates the 
repressive abilities of Arx in a beta-cell line.
CONCLUSION: Although Tle1, 2, 3, and 4 show overlapping expression in pancreatic 
progenitors and in the adult islet, the expression of these factors is restricted
to different cell types during endocrine cell maturation. Of note, Tle2 and Tle3 
are co-expressed with Gro/TLE interaction domain containing transcription factors
that are essential for endocrine pancreas development. We further demonstrate
that Tle2 can interact with several of these factors and that Tle2 modulate Arx's
repressive activity. Taken together our studies suggest that Gro/TLE proteins
play a role in the repression of target genes during endocrine cell
specification.

A theoretical analysis is presented with experimental confirmation to
conclusively demonstrate the critical role that annealing plays in efficient PCR 
amplification of GC-rich templates. The analysis is focused on the annealing of
primers at alternative binding sites (competitive annealing) and the main result 
is a quantitative expression of the efficiency (eta) of annealing as a function
of temperature (T(A)), annealing period (t(A)), and template composition. The
optimal efficiency lies in a narrow region of T(A) and t(A) for GC-rich templates
and a much broader region for normal GC templates. To confirm the theoretical
findings, the following genes have been PCR amplified from human cDNA template:
ARX and HBB (with 78.72% and 52.99% GC, respectively). Theoretical results are in
excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Optimum annealing times for
GC-rich genes lie in the range of 3-6s and depend on annealing temperature.
Annealing times greater than 10s yield smeared PCR amplified products. The
non-GC-rich gene did not exhibit this sensitivity to annealing times. Theory and 
experimental results show that shorter annealing times are not only sufficient
but can actually aid in more efficient PCR amplification of GC-rich templates.

OBJECTIVE: We have recently shown that de novo mutations in the TUBA1A gene are
responsible for a wide spectrum of neuronal migration disorders. To better define
the range of these abnormalities, we searched for additional mutations in a
cohort of 100 patients with lissencephaly spectrum for whom no mutation was
identified in DCX, LIS1 and ARX genes and compared these data to five previously 
described patients with TUBA1A mutations.
RESULTS: We detected de novo TUBA1A mutations in six patients and highlight the
existence of a prominent form of TUBA1A related lissencephaly. In four patients, 
the mutations identified, c.1190T>C (p.L397P), c.1265G>A (p.R422H), c.1264C>T
(p.R422C), c.1306G>T (p.G436R), have not been reported before and in two others, 
the mutation corresponds to a recurrent missense mutation, c.790C>T (p.R264C),
likely to be a hot spot of mutation. All together, it emerges that the TUBA1A
related lissencephaly spectrum ranges from perisylvian pachygyria, in the less
severe form, to posteriorly predominant pachygyria in the most severe, associated
with dysgenesis of the anterior limb of the internal capsule and mild to severe
cerebellar hypoplasia. When compared with a large series of lissencephaly of
other origins (ILS17, ILSX or unknown origin), these features appear to be
specific to TUBA1A related lissencephaly. In addition, TUBA1A mutated patients
share a common clinical phenotype that consists of congenital microcephaly,
mental retardation and diplegia/tetraplegia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the presence of consistent and specific
abnormalities that should allow the differentiation of TUBA1A related
lissencephalies from those related to LIS1, DCX and ARX genes.

In the developing nervous system, axons are guided to their targets by the growth
cone. Lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions from the growth cone underlie
motility and guidance. Many molecules that control lamellipodia and filopodia
formation, actin organization, and axon guidance have been identified, but it
remains unclear how these molecules act together to control these events.
Experiments are described here that indicate that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, two
WH2-domain-containing activators of the Arp2/3 complex, WVE-1/WAVE and
WSP-1/WASP, act redundantly in axon guidance and that GEX-2/Sra-1 and
GEX-3/Kette, molecules that control WAVE activity, might act in both pathways.
WAVE activity is controlled by Rac GTPases, and data are presented here that
suggest WVE-1/WAVE and CED-10/Rac act in parallel to a pathway containing
WSP-1/WASP and MIG-2/RhoG. Furthermore, results here show that the CED-10/WVE-1
and MIG-2/WSP-1 pathways act in parallel to two other molecules known to control 
lamellipodia and filopodia and actin organization, UNC-115/abLIM and
UNC-34/Enabled. These results indicate that at least three actin-modulating
pathways act in parallel to control actin dynamics and lamellipodia and filopodia
formation during axon guidance (WASP-WAVE, UNC-115/abLIM, and UNC-34/Enabled).

Relationships between onset latency and peak-to-peak amplitude of magnetic motor 
evoked potentials (MMEP) after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), together 
with the electroencephalographic parameters bispectral analysis index (BIS) and
the autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX)-derived auditory evoked
potential index (AAI) were explored during different sedative and hypnotic drug
combinations in six dogs. TMS was performed under sedation with
acepromazine/methadone or medetomidine and after a single bolus injection of
propofol or etomidate. Data for BIS and AAI were continuously collected during
the periods of treatment with the hypnotic drugs. Changes in BIS and AAI during
both periods were not statistically correlated with changes in onset latencies
and peak-to-peak amplitudes of MMEP after TMS. Therefore, both
electroencephalographic techniques are of limited use in titrating sedation and
anaesthesia during TMS in the dog.

Lissencephalies are congenital malformations responsible for epilepsy and mental 
retardation in children. A number of distinct lissencephaly syndromes have been
characterized, according to the aspect and the topography of the cortical
malformation, the involvement of other cerebral structures and the identified
genetic defect. A mutation in TUBA1A, coding for alpha 1 tubulin, was recently
identified in a mutant mouse associated with a behavioural disorder and a
disturbance of the laminar cytoarchitectony of the isocortex and the hippocampus.
Mutations of TUBA1A were subsequently found in children with mental retardation
and brain malformations showing a wide spectrum of severities. Here we describe
four fetuses with TUBA1A mutations and a prenatal diagnosis of major cerebral
dysgeneses leading to a termination of pregnancy due to the severity of the
prognosis. The study of these fetuses at 23, 25, 26 and 35 gestational weeks
shows that mutations of TUBA1A are associated with a neuropathological phenotypic
spectrum which consistently encompasses five brain structures, including the
neocortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum, cerebellum and brainstem. Less
constantly, abnormalities were also identified in basal ganglia, olfactory bulbs 
and germinal zones. At the microscopical level, migration abnormalities are
suggested by abnormal cortical and hippocampal lamination, and heterotopic
neurons in the cortex, cerebellum and brainstem. There are also numerous neuronal
differentiation defects, such as the presence of immature, randomly oriented
neurons and abnormal axon tracts and fascicles. Thus, the TUBA1A phenotype is
distinct from LIS1, DCX, RELN and ARX lissencephalies. Compared with the
phenotypes of children mutated for TUBA1A, these prenatally diagnosed fetal cases
occur at the severe end of the TUBA1A lissencephaly spectrum. This study
emphasizes the importance of neuropathological examinations in cases of
lissencephaly for improving our knowledge of the distinct pathogenetic and
pathophysiological mechanisms.

PURPOSE: To relate the histologic diagnosis and radiographic size with the
prognosis of 70 biopsies obtained via periapical surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy biopsies obtained during periapical surgery were
histologically analyzed following curettage of the tissue, establishing the
diagnosis as either apical granuloma, radicular cyst, or scar tissue. The
radiographic size of the lesion (area in mm(2)) before surgery and after 1 year
of follow-up was measured. The evolution at 12 months after surgery was evaluated
according to the criteria of von Arx and Kurt. A statistical study was made, the 
inter-variable relationships were studied using analysis of variance with
subsequent Tukey testing and calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Results indicated that 65.7% of lesions were granulomas, 25.7% scar
tissue, and 8.6% cysts. The larger lesions had the worst prognosis. Cysts had the
worst evolution at 12 months after surgery, this result being statistically
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for the periapical lesion depended on the type of
lesion and its radiographic size, with cysts and larger lesions having the worst 
evolution.

Distinct molecular pathways for development of telencephalic interneuron subtypes
revealed through analysis of Lhx6 mutants.

Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

Here we analyze the role of the Lhx6 lim-homeobox transcription factor in
regulating the development of subsets of neocortical, hippocampal, and striatal
interneurons. An Lhx6 loss-of-function allele, which expresses placental alkaline
phosphatase (PLAP), allowed analysis of the development and fate of
Lhx6-expressing interneurons in mice lacking this homeobox transcription factor. 
There are Lhx6+;Dlx+ and Lhx6-;Dlx+ subtypes of tangentially migrating
interneurons. Most interneurons in Lhx6(PLAP/PLAP) mutants migrate to the cortex,
although less efficiently, and exhibit defects in populating the marginal zone
and superficial parts of the neocortical plate. By contrast, migration to
superficial parts of the hippocampus is not seriously affected. Furthermore,
whereas parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons do not differentiate, NPY+
interneurons are present; we suggest that these NPY+ interneurons are derived
from the Lhx6-;Dlx+ subtype. Striatal interneurons show deficits distinct from
pallial interneurons, including a reduction in the NPY+ subtype. We provide
evidence that Lhx6 mediates these effects through promoting expression of
receptors that regulate interneuron migration (ErbB4, CXCR4, and CXCR7), and
through promoting the expression of transcription factors either known (Arx) or
implicated (bMaf, Cux2, and NPAS1) in controlling interneuron development.

An autoregressive approach for the prediction of water quality trends in systems 
subject to varying meteorological conditions and short observation periods is
discussed. Under these conditions, the dynamics of the system can be reliably
forecast, provided their internal processes are understood and characterized
independently of the external inputs. A methodology based on stationary and
non-stationary autoregressive processes with external inputs (ARX) is proposed to
assess and predict trends in hydrosystems which are at risk of contamination by
organic and inorganic pollutants, such as pesticides or nutrients. The procedures
are exemplified for the transport of atrazine and its main metabolite
deethylatrazine in a small agricultural catchment in France. The approach is
expected to be of particular value to assess current and future trends in water
quality as part of the European Water Framework Directive and Groundwater
Directives.

Color-tunable Zn(II) complexes of the type Zn( N,O-OPh (OxZ)ArX) 2 ( 5), where
the ligand consists of an oxazolylphenolate ion connected at the 4-position by a 
2,4-substituted aryl functional group with X = NMe 2 a, OMe b, Ph c, Cl d, F 2 e,
and CN f, were prepared. X-ray structural studies of 5a, 5b, and 5e showed that a
zinc atom was positioned in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment
created by two oxazolylphenolate ligands with N,O-chelation. Hammet plots of
absorption and emission maxima, respectively, in UV and photoluminescence (PL)
spectra with respect to electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups of the 
substituents indicate a direct correlation between the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) band gaps and
electronic alterations at the ligand sites. A similar correlation was also
observed for the reduction and oxidation potentials in cyclic voltammograms
(CVs). A gradual increase in the HOMO-LUMO band gap is seen from
electron-donating to electron-withdrawing functional groups, NMe 2 < OMe < Ph <
Cl < F 2 < CN. An emission peak with a maximum at 455 nm was achieved when the
most electron-withdrawing group (cyano) was applied to the oxazolylphenolate
ligand system. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on the HOMOs and
LUMOs for this series lead to a conclusion similar to that arrived at from a
blue-shift trend observed in UV data and trends in the CVs. The 4-coordinated
zinc complex ( 5c) was shown to be a potential blue-emitting material, exhibiting
a maximum efficiency of 1720 cd/m (2) at 17 V with 0.3 cd/A in a multilayered
device structure of ITO/NPB/ 5c/BCP/Alq 3/LiF/Al. On the basis of the low HOMO
level of this series, 5a was tested as a hole-transporting material; this
resulted in the successful fabrication of a multilayered device of ITO/
5a/DPVBI/Alq 3/LiF/Al with an efficiency of 7000 cd/m (2) at 13 V with 2.0 cd/A.

The aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene has been implicated in a wide spectrum
of disorders ranging from phenotypes with severe neuronal migration defects, such
as lissencephaly, to mild forms of X-linked mental retardation without apparent
brain abnormalities. To better understand its role in corticogenesis, we used in 
utero electroporation to knock down or overexpress ARX. We show here that
targeted inhibition of ARX causes cortical progenitor cells to exit the cell
cycle prematurely and impairs their migration toward the cortical plate. In
contrast, ARX overexpression increases the length of the cell cycle. In addition,
we report that RNA interference-mediated inactivation of ARX prevents cells from 
acquiring multipolar morphology in the subventricular and intermediate zones,
resulting in decreased neuronal motility. In contrast, ARX overexpression appears
to promote the development of tangentially oriented processes of cells in the
subventricular and intermediate zones and affects radial migration of pyramidal
neurons. We also demonstrate that the level of ARX expression is important for
tangential migration of GABA-containing interneurons, because both inactivation
and overexpression of the gene impair their migration from the ganglionic
eminence. However, our data suggest that ARX is not directly involved in
GABAergic cell fate specification. Overall, these results identify multiple and
distinct cell-autonomous roles for ARX in corticogenesis.

Periapical surgery in maxillary premolars and molars: analysis in terms of the
distance between the lesion and the maxillary sinus.

Garcia B(1), Penarrocha M, Martí E, Martínez JM, Gay-Escoda C.

(1)University Medical and Dental School, Valencia, Spain.

PURPOSE: This study compares periapical surgery (PS) of the maxillary premolars
and molars in close proximity to the maxillary sinus with those not in close
proximity, and assesses postoperative morbidity and prognosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out on clinical
cases of PS using the ultrasound technique. Only patients undergoing PS in
maxillary premolars and molars were included in this study; minimum follow-up was
set at 12 months. The cases were classified into 2 different groups in function
of the proximity of the periapical lesion to the maxillary sinus: group 1, when
the distance was less than 2 mm; group 2, when the distance was greater than or
equal to 2 mm. Postoperative morbidity was measured, as well as a clinical and
radiographic follow-up evaluating the overall mid- and long-term success rate
using von Arx and Kurt criteria. SPSS 12 was used for the statistical analysis.
All measures of estimated association were then tested for statistical
significance, and declared significant for P less than .05.
RESULTS: PS was carried out on 92 patients, 106 teeth, and 129 periapical
lesions. Group 1 was composed of 43 maxillary premolars and molars with 59
lesions, and group 2 of 63 teeth and 70 lesions. Maximum pain occurred during the
first 6 hours and swelling reached its peak on the second day. The overall
healing in maxillary premolars and molars was 75% success, 10% improvement, and
15% failure at 1-year follow-up. There were no significant differences between
the 2 groups regarding postoperative pain, swelling, and outcome (P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The success of PS in maxillary premolars and molars at 12 months
follow-up was 75%. Failure rates in premolars and molars in close proximity to
the maxillary sinus were higher than unrelated premolars and molars, but the
differences were not significant statistically.

Mutations in the ARX gene are responsible for a wide variety of mental
retardation conditions including X-linked infantile spasms (ISSX) and generalized
dystonia. However, electroclinical descriptions in patients with ISSX carrying
ARX mutations are scarce. Here, we report on the electroclinical features of a
4-year-old boy with an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the ARX gene.
Epilepsy started at 2 months of age with subclinical spasms that consisted of
episodes of eye rolling combined with atypical hypsarrhythmia. Later, the
condition evolved into severe mental retardation with polymorphic ictal episodes 
that consisted of nocturnal brief axial contractions followed by dyskinetic
movement of all four limbs and diurnal clusters of chaotic movements combined
with myoclonic jerks. EEG recording of these episodes lead to the diagnosis of
non-ictal dyskinetic movements. This combination of early infantile spasms
followed by a complex movement disorder contributes further to extent the
pleiotropy of the ARX-linked "interneuronopathy" and should lead the clinician to
ARX mutation screening.

We present four patients with ARX mutations and widely variant clinical
presentations. Case 1, a female with a known ARX mutation has refractory
infantile spasms and severe mental retardation. Case 2, a male presented with a
neurodegenerative disorder and has a known ARX mutation likely de novo as mother 
is not a carrier. Cases 3 and 4, two siblings with a novel variant in ARX, which 
is not clearly pathogenic, have developmental delay. One of the siblings had a
diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, failure to thrive with severe feeding
difficulties, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizures. There are very few affected 
females with ARX related infantile spasms. These cases expand the known phenotype
of this emerging condition.

X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) is a rare disorder caused
by mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene, located on Xp22.13.
Arx-null mice show loss of tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons,
presumably being related to caudal ganglionic eminence tangential migration. In
the present study, we investigated a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons in
the brain of an infant with XLAG, who had a novel nonsense mutation of the ARX
gene, compared with those of age-matched normal controls and Miller-Dieker
syndrome. We performed immunocytochemistry for interneuron and migration markers.
We found that glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)- and calretinin (CR)-containing
cells were significantly reduced in the neocortex and located in the white matter
and neocortical subventricular zone, while neuropeptide Y- or
cholecystokinin-containing cells were normally distributed. Moreover, in the
neocortical subventricular region, the GAD- and CR-containing cells expressed the
radial migration marker Mash-1 as well as nestin. Our findings suggest that ARX
protein controls not only the tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons from
the ganglionic eminence, but also may serve to induce radial migration from the
neocortical subventricular zone.

X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia syndrome (XLAG) (OMIM #3000215)
is a rare, severe malformation of the brain cortex with abnormal neuronal
migration caused by mutations of the ARX gene. All the reported patients with
lissencephaly are males who presented with a posterior-to-anterior gradient,
moderately increased thickness of the brain cortex, agenesis of corpus callosum, 
micropenis, and cryptorchidism. We describe the neurosonographic findings
associated with the XLAG syndrome. To our knowledge, the association between XLAG
and lenticulostriate vasculopathy has not been reported before.

A novel role for zebrafish zic2a during forebrain development.

Sanek NA(1), Grinblat Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Zoology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

Patterns of transcription factor expression establish a blueprint for the
vertebrate forebrain early in embryogenesis. In the future diencephalon, several 
genes with patterned expression have been identified, yet their specific
functions and interactions between them are not well understood. We have
uncovered a crucial role for one such gene, zic2a, during formation of the
anterior diencephalon in zebrafish. We show that zic2a is required for
transcription of the prethalamic markers arx and dlx2a. This function is required
during early steps of prethalamic development, soon after its specification. zic 
genes are evolutionarily related to glis, transcription factors that mediate
hedgehog signaling. Intriguingly, the hedgehog signaling pathway also acts to
promote development of the prethalamus. We asked if zic2a interacts with hedgehog
signaling in the context of forebrain development in zebrafish. Our data show
that hedgehog signaling and zic2a function at different times, and therefore act 
in parallel pathways during forebrain development. Taken together, our results
identify Zic2a as a novel regulator of prethalamic development, and show that it 
functions independently of hedgehog signaling.

INTRODUCTION: The rate of epilepsy in autism is higher than in other
developmental disorders and estimates point to a frequency range of between 7%
and 42%. Between 40% and 47% of autistic children suffer from clinical epilepsy. 
Onset of epilepsy may occur at any age.
DEVELOPMENT: During the ontogenesis of the nervous system, if the maturing
process is upset by some epileptogenic phenomenon, the consequences on the
consolidation of the emerging cognitive functions can be severe. Epileptiform
discharges can occur although clinical seizures are absent, but nevertheless they
still have an effect on the maturing process. Between 10% and 50% of autistic
children undergo a regression of acquired behaviour following a period of normal 
development. The absence of clinical seizures during regression does not rule out
the epileptogenic origin of the regressive process.
CONCLUSIONS: The relation between pervasive developmental disorders and epilepsy,
epileptiform activity and subclinical seizures can be explained from a
neurobiological point of view, on the one hand, by an imbalance between the
excitatory system -glutamate- and the inhibitory system -gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)- in key points in the cerebral cortex and, on the other, by means of
molecular genetic studies and studies of candidate genes (FOXP2, WNT2, subunits
of GABA receptors, neuroligins, ARX, SCN1A, SCN2A, MECP2, CDKL5 and DLX5).

Mechanisms of catalyst poisoning in palladium-catalyzed cyanation of haloarenes. 
remarkably facile C-N bond activation in the [(Ph3P)4Pd]/[Bu4N]+ CN- system.

Reaction paths leading to palladium catalyst deactivation during cyanation of
haloarenes (eq 1) have been identified and studied. Each key step of the
catalytic loop (Scheme 1) can be disrupted by excess cyanide, including ArX
oxidative addition, X/CN exchange, and ArCN reductive elimination. The catalytic 
reaction is terminated via the facile formation of inactive [(CN)4Pd]2-,
[(CN)3PdH]2-, and [(CN)3PdAr]2-. Moisture is particularly harmful to the
catalysis because of facile CN- hydrolysis to HCN that is highly reactive toward 
Pd(0). Depending on conditions, the reaction of [(Ph3P)4Pd] with HCN in the
presence of extra CN- can give rise to [(CN)4Pd]2- and/or the remarkably stable
new hydride [(CN)3PdH]2- (NMR, X-ray). The X/CN exchange and reductive
elimination steps are vulnerable to excess CN- because of facile phosphine
displacement leading to stable [(CN)3PdAr]2- that can undergo ArCN reductive
elimination only in the absence of extra CN-. When a quaternary ammonium cation
such as [Bu4N]+ is used as a phase-transfer agent for the cyanation reaction, C-N
bond cleavage in the cation can occur via two different processes. In the
presence of trace water, CN- hydrolysis yields HCN that reacts with Pd(0) to give
[(CN)3PdH]2-. This also releases highly active OH- that causes Hofmann
elimination of [Bu4N]+ to give Bu3N, 1-butene, and water. This decomposition mode
is therefore catalytic in H2O. Under anhydrous conditions, the formation of a new
species, [(CN)3PdBu]2-, is observed, and experimental studies suggest that
electron-rich mixed cyano phosphine Pd(0) species are responsible for this
unusual reaction. A combination of experimental (kinetics, labeling) and
computational studies demonstrate that in this case C-N activation occurs via an 
S(N)2-type displacement of amine and rule out alternative 3-center C-N oxidative 
addition or Hofmann elimination processes.

A method is presented for the high-throughput monitoring of reaction kinetics in 
homogeneous catalysis, running up to 25 coupling reactions in a single reaction
vessel. This method is demonstrated and validated on the Sonogashira reaction,
analyzing the kinetics for almost 500 coupling reactions. First, one-pot
reactions of phenylacetylene with a set of 20 different meta- and
para-substituted aryl bromides were analyzed in the presence of 17 different
Pd-phosphine complexes. In addition, the temperature-dependent Sonogashira
reactions were examined for 21 different ArX (X=Cl, Br, I) substrates, and the
corresponding activation enthalpies and entropies were determined by means of
Eyring plots: ArI (DeltaH(not equal)=48-62 kJ mol(-1); DeltaS(not equal)=-71--39 
J mol(-1) K; NO(2)-->OMe), ArBr (DeltaH(not equal)=54-82 kJ mol(-1), DeltaS(not
equal)=-55-11 J mol(-1) K), and ArCl (DeltaH(not equal)=95-144 kJ mol(-1),
DeltaS(not equal)=-6-100 J mol(-1) K). DFT calculations established a linear
correlation of DeltaH( not equal) and the Kohn-Sham HOMO energies of ArX (X=Cl,
Br, I) and confirmed their involvement in the rate-limiting step. However,
despite different C--X bond energies, aryl iodides and electron-deficient aryl
bromides showed similar activation parameters.

Semiparametric ARX neural-network models with an application to forecasting
inflation.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Economics, London School of Economics, London, WC2A 2AE, UK.

We examine semiparametric nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous
variables (NLARX) via three classes of artificial neural networks: the first one 
uses smooth sigmoid activation functions; the second one uses radial basis
activation functions; and the third one uses ridgelet activation functions. We
provide root mean squared error convergence rates for these ANN estimators of the
conditional mean and median functions with stationary beta-mixing data. As an
empirical application, we compare the forecasting performance of linear and
semiparametric NLARX models of US inflation. We find that all of our
semiparametric models outperform a benchmark linear model based on various
forecast performance measures. In addition, a semiparametric ridgelet NLARX model
which includes various lags of historical inflation and the GDP gap is best in
terms of both forecast mean squared error and forecast mean absolute deviation
error.

BACKGROUND: The human X chromosome has a biased gene content. One group of genes 
that is over-represented on the human X are those expressed in the brain,
explaining the large number of sex-linked mental retardation (MRX) syndromes.
RESULTS: To determine if MRX genes were recruited to the X, or whether their
brain-specific functions were acquired after relocation to the mammalian X
chromosome, we examined the location and expression of their orthologues in
marsupials, which diverged from human approximately 180 million years ago. We
isolated and mapped nine tammar wallaby MRX homologues, finding that six were
located on the tammar wallaby X (which represents the ancient conserved mammal X)
and three on chromosome 5, representing the recently added region of the human X 
chromosome. The location of MRX genes within the same synteny groups in human and
wallaby does not support the hypothesis that genes with an important function in 
the brain were recruited in multiple independent events from autosomes to the
mammalian X chromosome. Most of the tammar wallaby MRX homologues were more
widely expressed in tammar wallaby than in human. Only one, the tammar wallaby
ARX homologue (located on tammar chromosome 5p), has a restricted expression
pattern comparable to its pattern in human. The retention of the brain-specific
expression of ARX over 180 million years suggests that this gene plays a
fundamental role in mammalian brain development and function.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest all the genes in this study may have originally
had more general functions that became more specialised and important in brain
function during evolution of humans and other placental mammals.

A novel approach in food package defect detection is proposed based on system
identification theory, in which the channel defect detection problem can be
regarded as the conventional system identification problem, i.e., estimation of
the system impulse response based on the input-output sequence using parametric
and nonparametric models. The well-known parametric model ARX has been
investigated in this paper. The data are collected with a focused ultrasound
transducer (17.3 MHz, 6.35-mm diameter, f/2, 173 microm -6 dB pulse-echo lateral 
beam width at the focus) scanned over a rectangular grid, keeping the packages in
the focus. Performance is measured in terms of detection rate, image contrast,
and contrast-to-noise ratio. The results using the ARX model are compared with
previous image formation techniques and also compared with the non-parametric
method, i.e., spectral analysis. The results show that the ARX model has the
comparable detection rate as RFCS and higher detection rate than BAI and RFS
(except 6-microm air-filled channel in plastic trilaminate film) for channel in
plastic trilaminate film. The ARX model has achieved the moderate contrast
enhancement and ranks second in contrast-to-noise ratio enhancement among the
compared techniques. The ARX model has a low detection rate for channel defects
in aluminum trilaminate film, which shows that its performance is
material-dependent. Finally, the parametric method, ARX model demonstrates better
performance than the non-parametric method, spectral analysis for food package
defect detection.

INTRODUCTION: In periapical surgery, the absence of standardization between
different studies makes it difficult to compare the outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the healing classification of different authors and
evaluate the prognostic criteria of periapical surgery at 12 months.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients (101 men and 177 women) with a mean age of
38.1 years (range 11 to 77) treated with periapical surgery using the ultrasound 
technique and a 2.6x magnifying glass, and silver amalgam as root-end filling
material were included in the study. Evolution was analyzed using the clinical
criteria of Mikkonen et al., 1983; radiographic criteria of Rud et al., 1972; the
overall combined clinical and radiographic criteria of von Arx and Kurt, 1999;
and the Friedman (2005) concept of functional tooth at 12 months of surgery.
RESULTS: After 12 months, 87.2% clinical success was obtained according to the
Mikkonen et al., 1983 criteria; 73.9% complete radiographic healing using Rud et 
al. criteria; 62.1% overall success, following the clinical and radiographic
parameters of von Arx and Kurt, and 91.9% of teeth were functional. The von Arx
and Kurt criteria was found to be the most reliable.
CONCLUSION: Overall evolution according to von Arx and Kurt agreed most closely
with the other scales.

A pachygyria-causing alpha-tubulin mutation results in inefficient cycling with
CCT and a deficient interaction with TBCB.

The agyria (lissencephaly)/pachygyria phenotypes are catastrophic developmental
diseases characterized by abnormal folds on the surface of the brain and
disorganized cortical layering. In addition to mutations in at least four
genes--LIS1, DCX, ARX and RELN--mutations in a human alpha-tubulin gene, TUBA1A, 
have recently been identified that cause these diseases. Here, we show that one
such mutation, R264C, leads to a diminished capacity of de novo tubulin
heterodimer formation. We identify the mechanisms that contribute to this defect.
First, there is a reduced efficiency whereby quasinative alpha-tubulin folding
intermediates are generated via ATP-dependent interaction with the cytosolic
chaperonin CCT. Second, there is a failure of CCT-generated folding intermediates
to stably interact with TBCB, one of the five tubulin chaperones (TBCA-E) that
participate in the pathway leading to the de novo assembly of the tubulin
heterodimer. We describe the behavior of the R264C mutation in terms of its
effect on the structural integrity of alpha-tubulin and its interaction with
TBCB. In spite of its compromised folding efficiency, R264C molecules that do
productively assemble into heterodimers are capable of copolymerizing into
dynamic microtubules in vivo. The diminished production of TUBA1A tubulin in
R264C individuals is consistent with haploinsufficiency as a cause of the disease
phenotype.

Many researches have proved that auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can indicate
the depth of anesthesia in the clinical practice. This paper introduces two
methods of extracting AEP: the moving time average (MTA) model and the
autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX). In our study we used both the
MTA model and the ARX model to extract AEP and the results show that using the
ARX model can get the results significantly faster than using the MTA model, and 
the ARX model is more suitable for the real-time monitoring of the anesthetic
depth.

Mitte, Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The polymorphic family of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIRs) consists of activating and inhibitory receptors expressed by natural
killer (NK) cells and effector T cells that recognize human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) class I ligands. It has been suggested that KIR/HLA incompatibility exerts 
beneficial effects in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
METHODS: To elucidate whether certain receptor-ligand combinations between
recipient KIR and donor HLA antigens lead to enhanced alloreactivity of NK cells 
associated with acute rejection (aRx) after kidney transplantation, we analyzed
the entirety of matches/mismatches between KIR genes and known HLA ligands for
aRx patients (n=105) compared to patients with stable renal function (n=119).
RESULTS: Whereas HLA-C ligand incompatibility between donor and recipient has no 
influence on aRx, grafts derived from donors homozygous for HLA-C group 2 alleles
seem to demonstrate a better outcome (P=0.052). Additionally, a higher number of 
inhibitory receptors in the recipient's genotype (P=0.042), a significant higher 
number of matches for the receptors KIR2DL2/DS2 (P=0.004), as well as a higher
number of mismatches for KIR2DL3 (P=0.014) could be observed for patients with
stable renal function.
CONCLUSION: Our data illustrate that certain KIR/HLA class I ligand combinations 
between donor and recipient might influence graft short-term outcome after renal 
transplantation.

BACKGROUND: In order to understand the bioactivity of Myoporum bontioides A. Gray
against plant pathogens and determine its active ingredients, the inhibitory
activities of methanol extracts from M. bontioides against Fusarium oxysporum f. 
sp. niveum (E. F. Smith) Snyder & Hansen, Pestalotia mangiferae P. Henn.,
Thielaviopsis paradoxa (De Seynes) v. Hohnel, Colletotrichum musae (Berk. & M. A.
Curtis) v. Arx, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler, Mycosphaerella sentina (Fr.)
Schroter and Sphaceloma fawcettii Jenk. were evaluated using a growth rate
method, and the active ingredient was isolated by activity-directed isolation and
identified by determination and analysis of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass
spectra and correlative physical constants.
RESULTS: The results showed that the extracts from stems and leaves of M.
bontioides exhibited inhibitory activity against the seven fungi, with > 58%
inhibition at 10 g L(-1) after 72 h. The active compound was isolated and
identified as (-)-epingaione, and showed inhibitory activity against the above
seven fungi. The inhibitory activity against P. mangiferae was the highest, with 
an EC(50) value of 77 mg L(-1). The EC(50) values against the other six fungi
were 147-245 mg L(-1). (-)-Epingaione also inhibited spore germination of F.
oxysporum f. sp. niveum, T. paradoxa and S. fawcettii.
CONCLUSION: (-)-Epingaione demonstrated broad-spectrum inhibitory activity
against plant pathogenic fungi and is promising for exploitation as a fungicide.

Halo- and azidodediazoniation of arenediazonium tetrafluoroborates with

Reaction of [ArN(2)][BF(4)] salts immobilized in [BMIM][PF(6)] ionic liquid (IL) 
with TMSX (X = I, Br) and TMSN(3) represents an efficient method for the
preparation of iodo-, bromo-, and azido-derivatives via dediazoniation. The
reactions can also be effected starting with ArNH(2) by in situ diazotization
with [NO][BF(4)] followed by reaction with TMSX or TMSN(3). Depending on the
substituents on the benzenediazonium cation, competing fluorodediazoniation (ArF 
formation) and hydrodediazoniation (ArH formation) were observed. Dediazoniation 
with TMSN(3) and with TMSI generally gave the highest chemoselectivity toward
ArN(3) and ArI formation. The IL was recycled and reused up to 5 times with no
appreciable decrease in the conversions. Multinuclear NMR monitoring of the
interaction of [ArN(2)][BF(4)]/TMSX, [BMIM][PF6]/TMSX, and
[BMIM][PF(6)]/TMSX/[ArN(2)][BF(4)] indicated that TMSF is formed primarily via
[ArN(2)][BF(4)]/TMSX, generating [ArN(2)][X] in situ, which gives ArX on
dediazoniation. Competing formation of ArF in Sandmeyer-type bromodediazoniation 
of [ArN(2)][BF(4)] with Cu(I)Br immobilized in the IL points to significant
involvement of heterolytic dediazoniation.

Ghrelin is a novel target of Pax4 in endocrine progenitors of the pancreas and

Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

Pax4-deficient mice have a severe gastrointestinal endocrine deficiency: they
lack most pancreatic cells that produce insulin or somatostatin and various
duodenal endocrine cell types. Remarkably, Pax4-deficient mice also have an
overabundance of ghrelin-expressing cells in the pancreas and duodenum. Detailed 
analysis of the Pax4 nullizygous pancreas determined that the mutant islets are
largely composed of a distinctive endocrine cell type that expresses ghrelin,
glucagon, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), and low levels of Pdx1.
Lineage-tracing analysis revealed that most of these unique endocrine cells
directly arose from Pax4-deficient progenitors. Previous in vitro work reported
that Pax4 is a transcriptional repressor of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and 
glucagon. In this study, we expanded those results by showing that Pax4 is also a
repressor of gherlin. Together, our data further support the notion that Pax4
activity is necessary to establish appropriate patterns of gene expression in
endocrine progenitors of the digestive tract.

Mutual nonlinear prediction of cardiovascular variability series: comparison
between exogenous and autoregressive exogenous models.

Trento, 38050 Povo, Trento, Italy. luca.faes@unitn.it

A model-based approach to perform mutual nonlinear prediction of short
cardiovascular variability series is presented. The approach is based on
identifying exogenous (X) and autoregressive exogenous (ARX) models by K-nearest 
neighbors local linear approximation, and estimates the predictability of a
series given the other as the squared correlation between original and predicted 
values of the series. The method was first tested on simulations reproducing
different types of interaction between non-identical Henon maps, and then applied
to heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) variability series measured in healthy
subjects at rest and after head-up tilt. Simulations showed that different
coupling conditions were always detected by the X model but not by the ARX model.
The comparison between X and ARX models suggested the presence of oscillatory
sources determining the regularity of HR and BP dynamics independently of their
closed-loop mutual regulation. The transition from supine to upright position was
associated with an enhancement of the HR and BP mutual regulation, compatible
with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system induced by tilt.

Sydney NSW 2052, Australia. z2272629@student.unsw.edu.au

A noninvasive approach to the task of pulsatile flow estimation in an implantable
rotary blood pump (iRBP) has been proposed. Employing six fluid solutions
representing a range of viscosities equivalent to 20-50% blood hematocrit (HCT), 
pulsatile flow data was acquired from an in vitro mock circulatory loop. The
entire operating range of the pump was examined, including flows from -2 to 12
L/min. Taking the pump feedback signals of speed and power, together with the HCT
level, as input parameters, several flow estimate models were developed via
system identification methods. Three autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX)
model structures were evaluated: structures I and II used the input parameters
directly; structure II incorporated additional terms for HCT; and the third
structure employed as input a non-pulsatile flow estimate equation. Optimal model
orders were determined, and the associated models yielded minimum mean flow
errors of 5.49% and 0.258 L/min for structure II, and 5.77% and 0.270 L/min for
structure III, when validated on unseen data. The models developed in this study 
present a practical method of accurately estimating iRBP flow in a pulsatile
environment.

This paper aims to establish block-structured nonlinear model (Hammerstein model)
to predict oxygen uptake during moderate treadmill exercises. In order to model
the steady state relationship between oxygen uptake (oxygen consumption) and
walking speed, six healthy male subjects walked on a motor driven treadmill at
six different speed (2,3,4,5,6, and 7 km/h). The averaged oxygen uptake of
exercisers at steady state was measured by a mixing chamber based gas analyzer
(AEI Moxus Metabolic Cart). Based on these reliable experiment data, a nonlinear 
static function was obtained by using Support Vector Regression. In order to
capture the dynamics of oxygen uptake, a suitable Pseudo Random Binary Signal
(PRBS) input was designed and implemented on a computer controlled treadmill.
Breath by breath analysis of all exercisers' dynamic responses (PRBS responses)
to treadmill walking was performed. A useful ARX model is identified to justify
the measured oxygen uptake dynamics within the aerobic range. Finally, a
Hammerstein is achieved, which is useful for the control system design of oxygen 
uptake regulation during treadmill exercises.

Skeletal muscle fibers form in overlapping, but distinct phases that depend on
the generation of temporally different lineages of myogenic cells. During primary
myogenesis (E10.5-E12.5 in the mouse), embryonic myoblasts fuse homotypically to 
generate primary fibers, whereas during later development (E14.5-E17.5), fetal
myoblasts differentiate into secondary fibers. How these myogenic waves are
regulated remains largely unknown. Studies have been hampered by the lack of
markers which would distinguish embryonic from fetal myoblast populations. We
show here that the homeobox gene Arx is strongly expressed in differentiating
embryonic muscle, downstream of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes. Its
expression progressively decreases during development. When overexpressed in the 
C2C12 myogenic cell line, Arx enhances differentiation. Accordingly, it
stimulates the transcriptional activity from the Myogenin promoter and from
multimerized E-boxes when co-expressed with MyoD and Mef2C in CH310T1/2.
Furthermore, Arx co-immunoprecipitates with Mef2C, suggesting that it
participates in the transcriptional regulatory network acting in embryonic
muscle. Finally, embryonic myoblasts isolated from Arx-deficient embryos show a
delayed differentiation in vivo together with an enhanced clonogenic capacity in 
vitro. We propose here that Arx acts as a novel positive regulator of embryonic
myogenesis by synergizing with Mef2C and MyoD and by establishing an activating
loop with Myogenin.

Practical issues in the identification of empirical models from simulated type 1 
diabetes data.

Finan DA(1), Zisser H, Jovanovic L, Bevier WC, Seborg DE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara,
CA 93106-5080, USA.

BACKGROUND: A model-based controller for an artificial beta-cell automatically
regulates blood glucose levels based on available glucose measurements, insulin
infusion and meal information, and model predictions of future glucose trends.
Thus, the identification of simple, accurate models plays an important role in
the development of an artificial beta-cell.
METHODS: Glucose data simulated from a nonlinear physiological model of type 1
diabetes are used to identify linear dynamic models of two types: autoregressive 
exogenous input (ARX) and output-error (OE) models. The model inputs are meal
carbohydrates and exogenous insulin, which in practice are often administered
simultaneously and in the same ratio, i.e., the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio.
The effect of modeling these inputs as impulses versus time-smoothed profiles
("transformed inputs") is explored in depth. The models are evaluated based on
their ability to describe the data from which they were identified (i.e.,
calibration data) as well as independent data (i.e., validation data).
RESULTS: In general, the best models described their calibration data more
accurately using transformed inputs (R(Cal) (2) = 71% for the ARX models and R
(Cal) (2) = 78% for the OE models) than using impulse inputs (R (Cal) (2) = 14%
for the ARX models and R (Cal) (2) = 70% for the OE models). The only model/input
combination that resulted in consistently accurate validation fits was the ARX
models using transformed inputs (39% <or= R (Val) (2) <or= 58%).
CONCLUSIONS: When identifying non-physiologically based models from diabetes data
with simultaneous and proportional meals and insulin boluses, model accuracy is
improved by modeling the inputs as time-smoothed profiles. Also, while OE models 
describe their calibration data very well, ARX models more accurately describe
validation data. Their versatility makes ARX models a more attractive choice for 
implementation in a model-based controller of an artificial beta-cell.

We report the clinical course of a case of X-linked lissencephaly with absent
corpus callosum and abnormal genitalia (XLAG) exhibiting severe diarrhea. The
patient demonstrated lactose intolerance and his intractable seizures were
relieved with lactose-free, extensively hydrolyzed whey protein formula. At the
age of 2 years while being treated with the antiallergic formula, he was affected
with severe diarrhea that resembled watery diarrhea-hypokalemia-acidosis syndrome
(WDHA). Administration of octreotide was effective in relieving his secretory
diarrhea. Hypoglycemia without hyperinsulinemia was seen during fasting, and
plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was not increased when he had WDHA-like 
diarrhea. Although pancreas of ARX mutant mice revealed an increased number of
beta and delta cells, we did not detect the cause of hypoglycemia and secretory
diarrhea by pancreatic endocrinology. His urinary findings mimicked the symptoms 
of Fanconi syndrome, so it was possible that his hyperaldsteronemia affected not 
only his intestinal tract, but also his renal tubules.

This paper aims to establish a block-structured model to predict oxygen uptake in
humans during moderate treadmill exercises. To model the steady state
relationship between oxygen uptake (oxygen consumption) and walking speed, six
healthy male subjects walked on a motor driven treadmill with constant speed from
2 to 7 km/h. The averaged oxygen uptake at steady state (VO (2)) was measured by 
a mixing chamber based gas analysis and ventilation measurement system (AEI Moxus
Metabolic Cart). Based on these reliable date, a nonlinear steady state
relationship was successfully established using Support Vector Regression
methods. In order to capture the dynamics of oxygen uptake, the treadmill
velocity was modulated using a Pseudo Random Binary Signal (PRBS) input. Breath
by breath analysis of all subjects was performed. An ARX model was developed to
accurately reproduce the measured oxygen uptake dynamics within the aerobic
range. Finally, a Hammerstein model was developed, which may be useful for
implementing a control system for the regulation of oxygen uptake during
treadmill exercises.

Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (EIEE) is
one of the most severe and earliest forms of epilepsy, often evolving into West
syndrome; however, the pathogenesis of EIEE remains unclear. ARX is a crucial
gene for the development of interneurons in the fetal brain, and a polyalanine
expansion mutation of ARX causes mental retardation and seizures, including those
of West syndrome, in males. We screened the ARX mutation and found a hemizygous, 
de novo, 33-bp duplication in exon 2, 298_330dupGCGGCA(GCG)9, in two of three
unrelated male patients with EIEE. This mutation is thought to expand the
original 16 alanine residues to 27 alanine residues (A110_A111insAAAAAAAAAAA) in 
the first polyalanine tract of the ARX protein. Although EIEE is mainly
associated with brain malformations, ARX is the first gene found to be
responsible for idiopathic EIEE. Our observation that EIEE had a longer expansion
of the polyalanine tract than is seen in West syndrome is consistent with the
findings of earlier onset and more-severe phenotypes in EIEE than in West
syndrome.

Comment in
    Neurology. 2007 Jul 31;69(5):421-2.

BACKGROUND: ARX is a paired-type homeobox gene located on the X chromosome that
contains five exons with four polyalanine (PolyA) tracts, a homeodomain, and a
conserved C-terminal aristaless domain. Studies in humans have demonstrated
remarkable pleiotropy: malformation phenotypes are associated with protein
truncation mutations and missense mutations in the homeobox; nonmalformation
phenotypes, including X-linked infantile spasms (ISS), are associated with
missense mutations outside of the homeobox and expansion of the PolyA tracts.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of ARX, we performed mutation analysis in 115 
boys with cryptogenic ISS. This included two pairs of brothers.
RESULTS: We found an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat that codes for the
first PolyA tract from 10 to 17 GCG repeats (c.333_334ins[GCG]7) in six boys
(5.2%) ages 2 to 14, from four families, including the two pairs of brothers. In 
addition to ISS, all six boys had severe mental retardation and generalized
dystonia that appeared around the age of 6 months and worsened, eventually
leading to stable severe quadriplegic dyskinesia within age 2 years. Three
children experienced recurrent, life-threatening status dystonicus. In four
children brain MRI showed multiple small foci of abnormal cavitation on T1 and
increased signal intensity on T2 in the putamina, possibly reflecting progressive
multifocal loss of tissue.
CONCLUSION: The phenotype of infantile spasms with severe dyskinetic
quadriparesis increases the number of human disorders that result from the
pathologic expansion of single alanine repeats. ARX gene testing should be
considered in boys with infantile spasms and dyskinetic cerebral palsy in the
absence of a consistent perinatal history.

ARX (Aristaless-related homeobox gene) is located at Xp22. It contains 5 exons
and encodes a 562-amino acid protein. The protein contains 4 polyalanine tracts, 
3 of which are encoded in exon 2 and 1 in exon 4. Mutations in the ARX gene have 
been found in X-linked infantile spasms syndrome, Partington syndrome (mental
retardation with dystonic movements of the hands), X-linked lissencephaly with
abnormal genitalia, X-linked myoclonus epilepsy with spasticity and intellectual 
disability, and in nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation. The most common
mutation in ARX (seen in X-linked infantile spasms syndrome, Partington syndrome,
and X-linked mental retardation) is a 24-bp duplication in exon 2 resulting in
expansion of a polyalanine tract. Truncating mutations (deletions, frameshift,
non-sense) have been found in X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, as 
well as homeodomain missense mutations in X-linked myoclonus epilepsy with
spasticity and intellectual disability. The authors report a novel 24-bp in-frame
deletion within exon 2 of the ARX gene in a male child with X-linked mental
retardation and review the spectrum of ARX mutations. This mutation results in a 
contraction of the second polyalanine repeat.

Twelve of the fifteen potential P450 enzymes from the bacterium Novosphingobium
aromaticivorans, which is known to degrade a wide range of aromatic hydrocarbons,
have been produced via heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The enzymes
were tested for their ability to bind a range of substrates including
polyaromatic hydrocarbons. While two of the enzymes were found to bind aromatic
compounds (CYP108D1 and CYP203A2), the others show binding with a variety of
compounds including linear alkanes (CYP153C1) and mono- and sesqui-terpenoid
compounds (CYP101B1, CYP101C1, CYP101D1, CYP101D2, CYP111A1, and CYP219A1). A
2Fe-2S ferredoxin (Arx-A), which is associated with CYP101D2, was also produced. 
The activity of five of the P450 enzymes (CYP101B1, CYP101C1, CYP101D1, CYP101D2,
and CYP111A2) was reconstituted with Arx-A and putidaredoxin reductase (of the
P450cam system from Pseudomonas putida) in a Class I type electron transfer
system. Preliminary characterisation of the majority of the substrate oxidation
products is reported.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene, ARX, have been a cause of
X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and are responsible for a vast phenotypic
spectrum including syndromic and non-syndromic forms of mental retardation. Since
the gene was initially identified, it has been generally screened in several
patients with XLMR. This study is the first report of ARX mutational screening in
Thai pediatric patients with delayed development. Two hundred and fifty-one
patients participated in this study. Two hundred and three of the 251 patients
were initially referred for molecular diagnosis of the Fragile XA syndrome and
had negative test results. The remaining 48 patients were specifically recruited 
for the ARX mutational analysis and had previously reported phenotypes of the ARX
mutations. Screening for the c.428_451 dup mutation was performed in all samples.
Screening for other point mutations in all coding exons was performed in all 48
patients recruited for the ARX mutational analysis and in 29 patients initially
referred for diagnosis of the Fragile XA syndrome who had two or more affected
males in the family suggesting an X-linked inheritance pattern. Two patients were
found to have the c.428_451 dup mutation. Considering genotype-phenotype
correlation, we suggest screening of the most common mutation, the c.428_451 dup 
mutation by PCR, in patients with infantile spasm syndrome, Partington syndrome
and non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation. Screening in patients who have
negative Fragile XA test results should be considered when no other known causes 
of mental retardation are identified especially in families with suggestive
X-linked inheritance pattern.

A method for on-line single sweep detection of somatosensory evoked potentials
(SEPs) during intraoperative neuromonitoring is proposed. It is based on a
radial-basis function neural network with Gaussian activations. In order to
improve its tracking capabilities, the radial-basis functions location is
partially learnt sweep-by-sweep; the training algorithm is effective, though
consistent with real-time applications. This new detection method has been tested
on simulated data so as to set the network parameters. Moreover, it has been
applied to real recordings obtained from a new neuromonitoring technique which is
based on the simultaneous observation of the SEP and of the evoked H-reflex
elicited by the same electric stimulus. The SEPs have been extracted using the
neural network and the results have then been compared to those obtained by ARX
filtering and correlated with the spinal cord integrity information obtained by
the H-reflex. The proposed algorithm has been proved to be particularly effective
and suitable for single-sweep detection. It is able to track both sudden and
smooth signal changes of both amplitude and latency and the needed computational 
time is moderate.

[Genetic and clinical aspects of lissencephaly].

[Article in French]

The term lissencephaly covers a group of rare malformations sharing the common
feature of anomalies in the appearance of brain convolutions (characterised by
simplification or absence of folding) associated with abnormal organisation of
the cortical layers as a result of neuronal migration defects during
embryogenesis. Children with lissencephaly have feeding and swallowing problems, 
muscle tone anomalies (early hypotonia and subsequently limb hypertonia),
seizures (in particular, infantile spasms) and severe psychomotor retardation.
Multiple forms of lissencephaly have been described and their current
classification is based on the associated malformations and underlying aetiology.
Two large groups can be distinguished: classical lissencephaly (and its variants)
and cobblestone lissencephaly. In classical lissencephaly (or type I), the cortex
appears thickened, with four more or less disorganised layers rather than six
normal layers. In the variants of classical lissencephaly, extra-cortical
anomalies are also present (total or subtotal agenesis of the corpus callosum
and/or cerebellar hypoplasia). The classical lissencephalies and the variant
forms can be further divided into several subgroups. Four forms can be
distinguished on the basis of their genetic aetiology: anomalies in the LIS1 gene
(isolated lissencephaly and Miller-Dieker syndrome), anomalies in the TUBA3 and
DCX genes, and lissencephalies caused by mutations in the ARX gene (XLAG
syndrome, X-linked lissencephaly with agenesis of the corpus callosum). The
incidence of all forms of type I lissencephaly is around 1 in 100,000 births. In 
addition to these four entities, isolated lissencephalies without a known genetic
defect, lissencephalies with severe microcephaly (microlissencephaly) and
lissencephalies associated with polymalformative syndromes are also included in
the group of classical lissencephalies. Cobblestone lissencephaly (formally
referred to as type II) is present in three entities: the Walker-Warburg,
Fukuyama and MEB (Muscle-Eye-Brain) syndromes. It is characterised by global
disorganisation of cerebral organogenesis with an uneven cortical surface (with a
pebbled or cobblestone appearance). Microscopic examination reveals total
disorganisation of the cortex and the absence of any distinguishable layers.
Management is symptomatic only (swallowing problems require adapted feeding to
prevent food aspiration, articular and respiratory physiotherapy to prevent
orthopaedic problems resulting from hyptonia and treatment of gastrooesophageal
reflux). The epilepsy is often resistant to treatment. The encephalopathy
associated with lissencephaly is often very severe and affected children are
completely dependent on the carer.

Being able to estimate the fMRI-BOLD response following a single task or stimulus
is certainly of value, since it allows to characterize its relationship to
different aspects either of the stimulus, or of the subject's performance. In
order to detect and characterize BOLD responses in single trials, we developed
and validated a procedure based on an AutoRegressive model with eXogenous Input
(ARX). The use of an individual exogenous input for each voxel makes the modeling
sensitive enough to reveal differences across regions, avoiding any a priori
assumption about the reference signal. The detection of variability across trials
is ensured by a suitable choice, for each voxel, of the order of the moving
average, which in our implementation determines the relative delay between the
recorded and the reference signal. This is a quality useful in finding different 
time profiles of activation from high temporal resolution fMRI data. The results 
obtained from simulated fMRI data resulting from synthetic activations in actual 
noise indicate that such approach allows to evaluate important features of the
response, such as the time to onset, and time to peak. Moreover, the results
obtained from real high temporal resolution fMRI data acquired at l.5 T during a 
motor task are consistent with previous knowledge about the responses of
different cortical areas in motor programming and execution. The proposed
procedure should also prove useful as a pre-processing step in different
approaches to the analysis of fMRI data.

X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and abnormal genitalia (XLAG) 
is caused by a mutation in the ARX gene. We herein report the clinical course of 
siblings with XLAG with a splicing mutation in ARX. Seizures were observed in
utero. Cerebral atrophy was progressive postnatally, and fetal
echoencephalography indicated that the atrophy might have started in the prenatal
period. They had a typical phenotype, except that the genital abnormality of the 
younger brother was not remarkable. A portal-systemic shunt that has not been
reported in cases with XLAG was seen in the older brother. The siblings had the
different complications and severity of disease in spite of possessing the same
mutation.

Molecular pathology of expanded polyalanine tract mutations in the
Aristaless-related homeobox gene.

The Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is one of the major genes causing
X-linked mental retardation. We have been interested in the pathogenic mechanism 
of expanded polyalanine tract mutations in ARX. We showed that the c.304ins(GCG)7
mutation causing an increase from 16 to 23 alanines increased the propensity of
ARX protein aggregation and a shift from nuclear to cytoplasmic localization. We 
proposed that mislocalization of ARX via cytoplasmic aggregation and subsequent
degradation leads to a partial loss of function, contributing to the
pathogenesis. We identified importin 13 (IPO13), a mediator of nuclear import for
a variety of proteins, as a novel ARX interacting protein. We predicted that the 
transport of ARX by IPO13 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus might be disrupted by
expanded polyalanine tract mutations, but our data showed that in both yeast and 
mammalian cells these mutant ARX proteins were still able to interact with IPO13.
We established the nuclear localization regions of the ARX homeodomain that were 
required for the interaction with IPO13 and correct localization of the
full-length ARX transcription factor to the nucleus.

expansions.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments are heterogeneous conditions, and it is
estimated that 10% may be caused by a defect of mental function genes on the X
chromosome. One of those genes is Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) encoding a
polyA-rich homeobox transcription factor essential for cerebral patterning and
its mutations cause different neurologic disorders. We reported on the clinical
and genetic analysis of an Italian family with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR)
and intra-familial heterogeneity, and provided insight into its molecular defect.
METHODS: We carried out on linkage-candidate gene studies in a new MRX family
(MRX87). All coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of ARX gene were analysed 
by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: MRX87 patients had moderate to profound cognition impairment and a
combination of minor congenital anomalies. The disease locus, MRX87, was mapped
between DXS7104 and DXS1214, placing it in Xp22-p21 interval, a hot spot region
for mental handicap. An in frame duplication of 24 bp (ARXdup24) in the second
polyAlanine tract (polyA_II) in ARX was identified.
CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the role of ARXdup24 as a critical mutational
site causing mental retardation linked to Xp22. Phenotypic heterogeneity of MRX87
patients represents a new observation relevant to the functional consequences of 
polyAlanine expansions enriching the puzzling complexity of ARXdup24-linked
diseases.

Monitoring the anaesthetic depth in children - an update.

Davidson AJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anaesthesia & Pain Management, Royal Children's Hospital,
Melbourne, Australia. andrew.davidson@rch.org.au

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are several commercially available
electroencephalogram-derived devices for monitoring anaesthesia depth. This
article reviews all published studies describing their use in children; first
assessing studies of performance in measuring anaesthesia depth in observational,
physiological studies and then describing relevant outcome studies. There is also
a brief discussion of why they might be useful, what physiological problems may
arise and what the reader should be wary of in the methodology of these studies. 
The subject is approached from a clinical perspective.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are several physiological studies suggesting that for
older children the bispectral index, entropy, Narcotrend index, cerebral state
index and A-line ARX index all change with induction of anaesthesia, and have
reasonable correlations with doses of anaesthetic agent. There is consistent
evidence that the performances are substantially poorer in infants. Some of these
devices have been demonstrated to reduce anaesthesia drug consumption and hasten 
recovery in older children.
SUMMARY: The bispectral index is the most widely studied, but at this stage there
is no evidence to suggest any one device is substantially superior to any other. 
There may be a role emerging for their use in older children, but their use in
infants cannot be supported.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring of anesthesia depth is difficult clinically, particularly 
in children. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation existing between
CSI (Cerebral State Index), or AAI (A-line ARX) and a clinical sedation scale
such as UMSS (University of Michigan Sedation Scale), during deep sedation with
propofol in children undergoing diagnostic procedures.
METHODS: Twenty ASA I and II children, scheduled to undergo deep sedation for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS), were
enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to receive depth of anesthesia
monitoring with CSI or AAI. The anesthetist administered repeated doses of
propofol every 10 s to a UMSS score of 3-4. An attending anesthetist, not
involved in drug administration, recorded time and doses of sedation medications,
vital signs, UMSS score and CSI or AAI score. All the evaluations were recorded
at awake state (baseline), every 10 s until an UMSS score of 3-4 and every 3 min 
until the children were awake.
RESULTS: We enrolled 13 males and seven females ranging in age from 8 months to 7
years. After induction of anesthesia CSI and AAI scores decreased and from the
end of the procedure to emergence the two scores increased. The CSI data showed a
strong correlation with the UMSS scores (r = -0.861; P < 0.0001); we found a
similar correlation between the AAI data and the UMSS scores (r = -0.823; P <
0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that CSI and AAI may be two, real-time and
objective tools to assess induction and emergence during propofol sedation in
children undergoing EGDS and MRI.

Inactivation of Arx, the murine ortholog of the X-linked lissencephaly with

ARX loss-of-function mutations cause X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous
genitalia (XLAG), a severe neurological condition that results in profound brain 
malformations, including microcephaly, absence of corpus callosum, and impairment
of the basal ganglia. Despite such dramatic defects, their nature and origin
remain largely unknown. Here, we used Arx mutant mice as a model to characterize 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the basal ganglia alterations.
In these animals, the early differentiation of this tissue appeared normal,
whereas subsequent differentiation was impaired, leading to the periventricular
accumulation of immature neurons in both the lateral ganglionic eminence and
medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Both tangential migration toward the cortex and
striatum and radial migration to the globus pallidus and striatum were greatly
reduced in the mutants, causing a periventricular accumulation of NPY+ or
calretinin+ neurons in the MGE. Arx mutant neurons retained their differentiation
potential in vitro but exhibited deficits in morphology and migration ability.
These findings imply that cell-autonomous defects in migration underlie the
neuronal localization defects. Furthermore, Arx mutants lacked a large fraction
of cholinergic neurons and displayed a strong impairment of thalamocortical
projections, in which major axon fiber tracts failed to traverse the basal
ganglia. Altogether, these results highlight the critical functions of Arx in
promoting neural migration and regulating basal ganglia differentiation in mice, 
consistent with the phenotype of XLAG patients.

Embryonic endocrine pancreas and mature beta cells acquire alpha and PP cell

Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) was recently demonstrated to be involved in
pancreatic alpha cell fate specification while simultaneously repressing the beta
and delta cell lineages. To establish whether Arx is not only necessary, but also
sufficient to instruct the alpha cell fate in endocrine progenitors, we used a
gain-of-function approach to generate mice conditionally misexpressing this
factor. Mice with forced Arx expression in the embryonic pancreas or in
developing islet cells developed a dramatic hyperglycemia and eventually died.
Further analysis demonstrated a drastic loss of beta and delta cells.
Concurrently, a remarkable increase in the number of cells displaying alpha cell 
or, strikingly, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cell features was observed. Notably, 
the ectopic expression of Arx induced in embryonic or adult beta cells led to a
loss of the beta cell phenotype and a concomitant increase in a number of cells
with alpha or PP cell characteristics. Combining quantitative real-time PCR and
lineage-tracing experiments, we demonstrate that, in adult mice, the
misexpression of Arx, rather than its overexpression, promotes a conversion of
beta cells into glucagon- or PP-producing cells in vivo. These results provide
important insights into the complex mechanisms underlying proper pancreatic
endocrine cell allocation and cell identity acquisition.

Diabetes results from the absolute or relative deficiency of insulin-producing
beta cells. The prospect that non-beta pancreatic cells could be harnessed to
become beta cells has led to interest in understanding the plasticity of
pancreatic cells. Recent studies, however, have shown that adult beta cells are
largely derived from preexisting beta cells. In this issue of the JCI, Desai et
al. show that acinar cells, the major cell type in the pancreas, do not
contribute to new beta cells formed during pancreatic regeneration (see the
related article beginning on page 971). These studies suggest that the fate of
adult pancreatic cell lineages is immutable. However, also in this issue of the
JCI, Collombat et al. demonstrate that inducing a single transcription factor
named Arx in adult beta cells causes these cells to undergo massive
transdifferentiation into alpha and pancreatic polypeptide endocrine cells (see
the related article beginning on page 961). This finding points to an unexpected 
plasticity of postnatal pancreatic endocrine cells.

Temporal variation in mycophagy and prevalence of fungi associated with
developmental stages of Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).

Mycophagy by bark beetles is widespread. However, little is known regarding which
developmental stages of bark beetles actually feed on fungi. To study this
question, we sampled fungi associated with Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins
(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) throughout development in naturally attacked trees.
Isolations of fungi were made from phloem adjacent to brood and from brood
exoskeletons and guts. Overall, the incidence of fungi with individual brood
increased as brood development progressed. Grosmannia clavigera (Robinson-Jeffrey
and Davidson) Zipfel, de Beer and Wingf. and Ophiostoma montium (Rumbold) von Arx
exhibited generally opposing trends in prevalence. G. clavigera was most likely
to be found in phloem adjacent to prewintering third- and postwintering
fourth-instar larvae. O. montium was most likely to be found in phloem adjacent
to eggs, first-instar larvae, pupae, and teneral adults. In contrast to
isolations made from phloem, fungi isolated from brood guts and exoskeletons were
not observed to shift in prevalence. First- and third-instar larvae were often
observed migrating to older portions of their galleries, indicating that they do 
not spend all of their time feeding at, and extending, the apex of the gallery.
Our results suggest that not only are D. ponderosae brood in contact with and
feeding on fungi throughout development, but also, that during development,
contact of brood with a particular fungus is likely to change. Such temporal
shifts in fungal symbionts may be environmentally driven and have important
implications in how these fungi interact with their hosts within and across
generations.

Aristaless-related homeobox gene, the gene responsible for West syndrome and

Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is an important paired-type homeobox gene 
involved in the development of human brain. The ARX gene mutations are a
significant contributor to various forms of X-chromosome-linked mental
retardation with and without additional features including epilepsy,
lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, hand dystonia or autism. Here we
demonstrate that the human ARX protein is a potent transcriptional repressor,
which binds to Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) co-factor proteins
and the TLE1 in particular through its octapeptide (Engrailed homology repressor 
domain (eh-1) homology) domain. We show that the transcription repression
activity of ARX is modulated by two strong repression domains, one located within
the octapeptide domain and the second in the region of the polyalanine tract 4,
and one activator domain, the aristaless domain. Importantly, we show that the
transcription repression activity of ARX is affected by various naturally
occurring mutations. The introduction of the c.98T>C (p.L33P) mutation results in
the lack of binding to TLE1 protein and relaxed transcription repression. The
introduction of the two most frequent ARX polyalanine tract expansion mutations
increases the repression activity in a manner dependent on the number of extra
alanines. Interestingly, deletions of alanine residues within polyalanine tracts 
1 and 2 show low or no effect. In summary we demonstrate that the ARX protein is 
a strong transcription repressor, we identify novel ARX interacting proteins
(TLE) and offer an explanation of a molecular pathogenesis of some ARX mutations,
including the most frequent ARX mutations, the polyalanine tract expansion
mutations, c.304ins(GCG)7 and c.428_451dup.

The potential energy surfaces for the cycloaddition reactions of formally
double-bonded molecules containing group 13 elements have been studied using
density functional theory (B3LYP/LANL2DZ). Five group 13 alkene analogues,
ArX=XAr, where X = B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl, have been chosen as model reactants in 
this work. Our present theoretical work predicts that the smaller the
singlet-triplet splitting in ArX=XAr, the lower the activation barrier and, in
turn, the more rapid are its [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. Moreover, the
theoretical investigations suggest that the relative dimeric reactivity decreases
in the order B > Al > Ga > In > Tl. That is, the heavier the group 13 atom (X),
the more stable is its dimetallene toward chemical reactions. In consequence, our
results predict that the dimetallenes containing heavier group 13 elements (in
particular, X = Ga, In, and Tl) should be stable and should be readily
synthesized and isolated at room temperature. This is in good agreement with
available experimental observations. Besides this, the singlet-triplet energy
splitting of a dimetallene, as described in the configuration mixing model
attributed to the work of Pross and Shaik, can be used as a diagnostic tool to
predict its reactivity. The results obtained allow a number of predictions to be 
made.

In this paper we present data collection and methods for the selection of a model
class with the goal of automated neuromuscular blockade (NMB). Neuromuscular
response was measured in the presence of rocuronium in rabbits (N=5) and humans
(N=14). An average response was formed and used to determine optimal ARX and
Laguerre representations for a wide range of orders and parameters. A 6th order
Laguerre model was selected based on its accuracy and simplicity. Models were
identified for each subject. For each group, variation was measured by comparison
to the average response. The standard deviation of the average impulse response
static gain was 45.4 and 45.8% of the mean for the rabbit and human models,
respectively. The range of static gain was 121 and 159% of the mean for the
rabbit and human datasets. Frequency domain analysis showed differences in gain
of 12 and 15dB, and phase of 45 and 75&#176; for the rabbit and human models
respectively. With this knowledge, design and development of appropriate
controllers for NMB will proceed.

Efficacy of using mean arterial blood pressure sequence for linear modeling of
cerebral autoregulation.

Linear autoregressive (ARX) models are often used to describe the dynamic
cerebral autoregulation in humans by relating cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV)
to beat-to-beat mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). For linear model estimation 
it is required that the input be persistently exciting. This study aimed to
establish if the MABP is adequately persistently exciting for estimating to yield
a linear model. Using ARX models with MABP as input and CBFV as output, linear
models for 11 healthy normal subjects in supine position were obtained. The order
of the models was allowed to vary between 1 to 10. For each subject, the model
with the least mean squared error (MSE) value was selected, called Ma. Ma was
then treated as the unknown model of the cerebral autoregulation to be estimated.
Ma was separately subjected to the measured MABP as well as a pseudo random
binary sequence (PRBS) to estimate two ARX models for it. The resulting estimates
of Ma with the lowest MSE were selected as Me1 and Me2, respectively. With the
measured MABP as input, the MSE values between the resulting output of Me1 and
Me2 and the measured CBFV were calculated. These MSE values were compared to the 
MSE value previously obtained for Ma to determine if Me1 that was obtained using 
MABP can estimate CBFV with the same level of accuracy as Me2. This analysis was 
carried out both with the traditional 6 minutes data and was repeated by dividing
the 6 minutes of data into four 1.5 minute sections, a total of 5 comparisons.
The analysis showed that the computed MSE values for Ma, Me1 and Me2 were the
same for each subject, irrespecteve of the duration of the data set used for the 
study. However, the orders of the models were not identical. For each of the
three models the average MSE value for 11 subjects was 0.0200 for 6
minutes,0.0235 for first 1.5 minute and 0.0263, 0.0278 and 0.0255 for secon,
third and fourth 1.5 minutes, respectively. Results suggest that 1.5 minutes of
MABP sequence is adequate as input for estimating linear models of cerebral
autoregulation.

Author information:

Malaysia.

A parametric approach is proposed for the characterization of the upper vascular 
tree. The novelty of the approach resides in it being differential: the processed
signals are the photoplethysmograms obtained non-invasively from the left and
right indexes. The investigated model is an ARX (auto-regressive with exogenous
input) where the order has been estimated utilizing standard techniques. The
model coefficients show a relatively high degree of stability.

somatosensory evoked potentials.

A.

Author information: 
(1)Dept. of Biomedical Eng., Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.

The aim of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the employment of a 
Gaussian radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) for the on-line detection
of single sweep somatosensory evoked potentials (SswSEPs), paying particular
attention to the capability of tracking trial-to-trial variabilities. On the
basis of simulations the parameters of the network have been set and the results 
have then been compared with those obtained from other methods, in particular
with the ensemble averaging, the moving window averaging and the ARX filtering.
This research shows a better performance of the RBFNN, because it is able to
follow changes of the underlying signal even in noisy conditions and does not
require prior assumptions.

Structural health monitoring using piezoelectric impedance measurements.

Park G(1), Inman DJ.

Author information: 
(1)The Engineering Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM
87545, USA. gpack@lanl.gov

This paper presents an overview and recent advances in impedance-based structural
health monitoring. The basic principle behind this technique is to apply
high-frequency structural excitations (typically greater than 30kHz) through
surface-bonded piezoelectric transducers, and measure the impedance of structures
by monitoring the current and voltage applied to the piezoelectric transducers.
Changes in impedance indicate changes in the structure, which in turn can
indicate that damage has occurred. An experimental study is presented to
demonstrate how this technique can be used to detect structural damage in real
time. Signal processing methods that address damage classifications and data
compression issues associated with the use of the impedance methods are also
summarized. Finally, a modified frequency-domain autoregressive model with
exogenous inputs (ARX) is described. The frequency-domain ARX model, constructed 
by measured impedance data, is used to diagnose structural damage with levels of 
statistical confidence.

Comment in
    Acta Anaesthesiol Taiwan. 2006 Dec;44(4):191-2.

BACKGROUND: The A-line ARX Index (AAI) has been used as an indicator of depth of 
anesthesia. The study examined whether AAI-guided endotracheal intubation (EI),
compared with experience guidance, could provide better hemodynamic stability
during general anesthesia (GA).
METHODS: One hundred and four patients were included in this study. In the
control group, EI was performed based on the judgment of the anesthesiologist by 
clinical experience. In the study groups, EI was performed at an AAI value of
either 15, 20, or 30. GA was induced with cisatracurium, lidocaine, fentanyl,
thiamylal and succinylcholine. Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)
were recorded at baseline, 1 min before and 1 and 3 min after intubation. The
change of hemodynamics over 20% in the space between 1 min before and after
intubation was defined as severe change.
RESULTS: The incidences of severe changes of HR and MAP in the AAI-15 and AAI-20 
groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (19% and 39% vs. 
68%, P < 0.01 and 0.05; 52% and 52% vs. 91%, P < 0.01, respectively). The
induction time was significantly shorter in the control group than that in the
study groups (183 +/- 47 vs. 366 +/- 151, 248 +/- 53, and 255 +/- 85 sec, P <
0.01). Highest dose of thiamylal and longest induction time were needed in the
AAI-15 group.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the routine clinical practice, AAI monitoring helps to
achieve better condition for EI during induction with less hemodynamic changes.
The AAI value of 20 is suggested as an optimal indicator for EI.

[Extraction of single-trial event-related potentials by means of ARX modeling and
independent component analysis].

[Article in Chinese]

Wang R(1), Du S.

Author information:

The present paper focused on the extraction of event-related potentials on a
single sweep under extremely low S/N ratio. Two methods that can efficiently
remove spontaneous EEG, ocular artifacts and power line interference were
presented based on ARX modeling and independent component analysis (ICA). The
former method applied ARX model to the measured compound signal that extensively 
contained the three kinds of ordinary noises mentioned above, and used ARX
algorithm for parametric identification. The latter decomposed the signal by
means of independent component analysis. Besides, some of ICA's important
decomposing characters and its intrinsic causality were pointed out definitely.
According to the practical situation, some modification on FastICA algorithm was 
also given, so as to implement auto-adaptive mapping of decomposed results to ERP
component. Through simulation, both the two ways are proved to be highly capable 
of signal extraction and S/N ratio improving.

Single trial somatosensory evoked potential extraction with ARX filtering for a
combined spinal cord intraoperative neuromonitoring technique.

BACKGROUND: When spinal cord functional integrity is at risk during surgery,
intraoperative neuromonitoring is recommended. Tibial Single Trial Somatosensory 
Evoked Potentials (SEPs) and H-reflex are here used in a combined neuromonitoring
method: both signals monitor the spinal cord status, though involving different
nervous pathways. However, SEPs express a trial-to-trial variability that is
difficult to track because of the intrinsic low signal-to-noise ratio. For this
reason single trial techniques are needed to extract SEPs from the background
EEG.
METHODS: The analysis is performed off line on data recorded in eight scoliosis
surgery sessions during which the spinal cord was simultaneously monitored
through classical SEPs and H-reflex responses elicited by the same tibial nerve
electrical stimulation. The single trial extraction of SEPs from the background
EEG is here performed through AutoRegressive filter with eXogenous input (ARX).
The electroencephalographic recording can be modeled as the sum of the background
EEG, which can be described as an autoregressive process not related to the
stimulus, and the evoked potential (EP), which can be viewed as a filtered
version of a reference signal related to the stimulus. The choice of the filter
optimal orders is based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The reference 
signal used as exogenous input in the ARX model is a weighted average of the
previous SEPs trials with exponential forgetting behavior.
RESULTS: The moving average exponentially weighted, used as reference signal for 
the ARX model, shows a better sensibility than the standard moving average in
tracking SEPs fast inter-trial changes. The ability to promptly detect changes
allows highlighting relations between waveform changes and surgical maneuvers. It
also allows a comparative study with H-reflex trends: in particular, the two
signals show different fall and recovery dynamics following stressful conditions 
for the spinal cord.
CONCLUSION: The ARX filter showed good performances in single trial SEP
extraction, enhancing the available information concerning the current spinal
cord status. Moreover, the comparison between SEPs and H-reflex showed that the
two signals are affected by the same surgical maneuvers, even if they monitor the
spinal cord through anatomically different pathways.

Spectral entropy assessment with auditory evoked potential in neuroanesthesia.

Martorano P(1), Facco E, Falzetti G, Pelaia P.

Author information: 
(1)Neurosciences Department, Anesthesia and Intensive Care Section, Polytechnic
University of Marche, Ancona, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: The assessment of the level of anesthesia is a very hard task, since
no gold standard has stood out in the past three decades. Middle Latency Auditory
Evoked Potential (MLAEP) is one of the most popular neurophysiological tools for 
anesthesia monitoring. Recently, Spectral Entropy (SpEn) has been introduced: it 
provides two different parameters, State Entropy (SE) and Response Entropy (RE). 
The aim of this prospective study is to check SpEn end-point, comparing it to
MLAEPs in neurosurgical anesthesia.
METHODS: Twenty patients submitted to elective supratentorial neurosurgery for
removal of a temporal-parietal meningioma were included in the study. SpEn and
MLAEPs were simultaneously monitored using the M-entropy module S/5 (GE Health
Care, Helsinki, Finland) and Alaris Medical System AEP-ARX index monitor (AAI)
(Kidemosevej, Denmark), respectively.
RESULTS: Four thousand and sixty four data points of SE, RE and AAI were recorded
and ROC curves comparing AAI to RE and SE showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) 
area under the curve. The RE and SE cut-off values (showing maximal sensitivity
with maximal specificity) to discriminate anesthesia from awake or consciousness 
sedation were 61 and 58, respectively. However, in a group of data points, low
AAI was associated to high SpEn (577 data points for RE and 770 for SE) and vice 
versa (31 data points for RE and 43 for SE). The prediction probability for SE
was 0.977 and for RE was 0.968.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SpEn is as effective as AAI.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that SpEn is able to discriminate between the
levels of wakefulness and surgical anesthesia. However, the meaning of data
showing a discrepancy between AAI and SpEn is not yet clear and calls for further
study.

The activating cytotoxicity receptor NKG2D binds to stress-regulated molecules
encoded by the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) and
UL-16-binding protein (ULBP)/retinoic acid early transcript (RAET) gene family.
To assess whether acute allograft rejection leads to an induction of these
inducible ligands and their receptor NKG2D, we examined the mRNA profiles in
kidney transplant biopsies. Expression levels were correlated with the incidence 
of acute rejection (aRx) episodes and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) proven 
by histology. Whereas MICA, ULBP1/3 and RAET1-E did not display heightened gene
expression, elevated levels of NKG2D mRNA could be associated with aRx (p <
0.001). Immunohistology of kidney biopsies diagnosed with aRx revealed NKG2D+
cells in tubulointerstitial areas positive for CD8+ cells. Most importantly,
elevated levels of NKG2D mRNA were associated with restricted long-term graft
function assessed by the glomerular filtration rate at 6, 12 and 18 months
posttransplantation. Induced NKG2D mRNA expression was still observable in
biopsies diagnosed with CAN (p < 0.001), demonstrating a higher sensitivity and
specificity compared to CD3, granzyme B and granulysin mRNA measurement.
Significant elevated levels of NKG2D mRNA could be further detected in urine
sediment prior to aRx, suggesting this receptor as a new candidate marker for the
diagnosis of acute and chronic allograft rejection.

Mutations in the Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) gene are associated with a
broad spectrum of disorders, including nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation, 
sometimes associated with epilepsy, as well as syndromic forms with brain
abnormalities and abnormal genitalia. Furthermore, ARX mutations have been
described in a few patients with autism or autistic features. In this study, we
screened the ARX gene in 226 male patients with autism spectrum disorders and
mental retardation; 42 of the patients had epilepsy. The mutation analysis was
performed by direct sequencing of all exons and flanking regions. No ARX
mutations were identified in any of the patients tested. These findings indicate 
that mutations in the ARX gene are very rare in autism.

Detection and visualization of storm hydrograph changes under urbanization: an
impulse response approach.

Farahmand T(1), Fleming SW, Quilty EJ.

Author information: 
(1)Aquatic Informatics Inc., 210 - 1050 Homer St., Vancouver, BC, Canada V6B 2W9.

Urbanization often alters catchment storm responses, with a broad range of
potentially significant environmental and engineering consequences. At a
practical, site-specific management level, efficient and effective assessment and
control of such downstream impacts requires a technical capability to rapidly
identify development-induced storm hydrograph changes. The method should also
speak specifically to alteration of internal watershed dynamics, require few
resources to implement, and provide results that are intuitively accessible to
all watershed stakeholders. In this short paper, we propose a potential method
which might satisfy these criteria. Our emphasis lies upon the integration of
existing concepts to provide tools for pragmatic, relatively low-cost
environmental monitoring and management. The procedure involves calibration of
rainfall-runoff time-series models in each of several successive time windows,
which sample varying degrees of watershed urbanization. As implemented here, only
precipitation and stream discharge or stage data are required. The readily
generated unit impulse response functions of these time-series models might then 
provide a mathematically formal, yet visually based and intuitive, representation
of changes in watershed storm response. Nominally, the empirical response
functions capture such changes as soon as they occur, and the assessments of
storm hydrograph alteration are independent of variability in meteorological
forcing. We provide a preliminary example of how the technique may be applied
using a low-order linear ARX model. The technique may offer a fresh perspective
on such watershed management issues, and potentially also several advantages over
existing approaches. Substantial further testing is required before attempting to
apply the concept as a practical environmental management technique; some
possible directions for additional work are suggested.

Drought is the major constraint to chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) productivity
worldwide. Utilizing early-flowering genotypes and advancing sowing from spring
to autumn have been suggested as strategies for drought avoidance. However,
Ascochyta blight (causal agent: Didymella rabiei (Kov.) v. Arx.) is a major
limitation for chickpea winter cultivation. Most efforts to introgress resistance
to the pathogen into Kabuli germplasm resulted in relatively late flowering
germplasm. With the aim to explore the feasibility of combining earliness and
resistance, RILs derived from a cross between a Kabuli cultivar and a Desi
accession were evaluated under field conditions and genotyped with SSR markers.
Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with significant effects on resistance were 
identified: two linked loci located on LG4 in epistatic interaction and a third
locus on LG8. Two QTLs were detected for time to flowering: one in LG1 and
another on LG2. When resistance and time to flowering were analyzed together, the
significance of the resistance estimates obtained for the LG8 locus increased and
the locus effect on days to flowering, previously undetected, was significantly
different from zero. The identification of a locus linked both to resistance and 
time to flowering may account for the correlation observed between these traits
in this and other breeding attempts.

Activin A decreases glucagon and arx gene expression in alpha-cell lines.

Activin A is a potent growth and differentiation factor involved in development, 
differentiation, and physiological functions of the endocrine pancreas; it
increases insulin and pax4 gene expression in beta-cells and can induce
transdifferentiation of the exocrine acinar cell line AR42J into
insulin-producing cells. We show here that Activin A decreases glucagon gene
expression in the alpha-cell lines InR1G9 and alphaTC1 in a dose- and
time-dependent manner and that the effect is blocked by Follistatin. This effect 
is also observed in adult human islets. Glucagon gene expression is inhibited at 
the transcriptional level by the Smad signaling pathway through the G3 DNA
control element. Furthermore, Activin A decreases cell proliferation of InR1G9
and alphaTC1 cells as well as cyclin D2 and arx gene expression, whose protein
product Arx has been shown to be critical for alpha-cell differentiation.
Overexpression of Arx in Activin A-treated InR1G9 cells does not prevent the
decrease in glucagon gene expression but corrects the inhibition of cell
proliferation, indicating that Arx mediates the Activin A effects on the cell
cycle. We conclude that Activin A has opposite effects on alpha-cells compared
with beta-cells, a finding that may have relevance during pancreatic endocrine
lineage specification and physiological function of the adult islets.

BACKGROUND: Automated indices derived from mid-latency auditory evoked potentials
(MLAEP) have been proposed for monitoring the state of anaesthesia. The A-Line
ARX index (AAI) has been implemented in the A-Line monitor (Danmeter, V1.4).
Several studies have reported variable and, in awake patients, sometimes
surprisingly low AAI values. The purpose of this study was to reproduce these
findings under steady-state conditions and to investigate their causes.
METHODS: Ten awake unmedicated volunteers were studied under steady-state
conditions. For each subject, the raw EEG and the AAI were recorded with an
A-Line monitor (V1.4) during three separate sessions of 45.0 (1.6) min duration
each. MATLAB (Mathworks) routines were used to derive MLAEP responses from EEG
data and to calculate maximal MLAEP amplitudes.
RESULTS: The AAI values ranged from 15 to 99, while 11.4% fell below levels
which, according to the manufacturer, indicate an anaesthetic depth suitable for 
surgery. Inter-individual and intra-individual variation was observed despite
stable recording conditions. The amplitudes of the MLAEP varied from 0.8 to 42.0 
microV. The MLAEP amplitude exceeded 2 microV in 75.3% of readings. The
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the MLAEP amplitude and the AAI
value was r=0.89 (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The version of the A-Line monitor used in this study does not
exclude contaminated MLAEP signals. Previous publications involving this version 
of the A-Line monitor (as opposed to the newer A-Line/2 monitor series) should be
reassessed in the light of these findings. Before exclusively MLAEP-based
monitors can be evaluated as suitable monitors of depth of anaesthesia, it is
essential to ensure that inbuilt validity tests eliminate contaminated MLAEP
signals.

In this paper, we will present and review the most usual methods to detect linear
and nonlinear causality between signals: linear Granger causality test (Geweke in
J Am Stat Assoc 77:304-313, 1982) extended to direct causality in multivariate
case (LGC), directed coherence (DCOH, Saito and Harashima in Recent advances in
EEG and EMG data processing, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1981), partial directed
coherence (PDC, Sameshima and Baccala 1999) and nonlinear Granger causality test 
of Baek and Brock (in Working Paper University of Iowa, 1992) extended to direct 
causality in multivariate case (partial nonlinear Granger causality, PNGC). All
these methods are tested and compared on several ARX, Poisson and nonlinear
models, and on neurophysiological data (depth EEG). The results show that LGC,
DCOH and PDC are not very robust in relation to nonlinear linkages but they seem 
to correctly find linear linkages if only the autoregressive parts are nonlinear.
PNGC is extremely dependent on the choice of parameters. Moreover, LGC and PNGC
may give misleading results in the case of causality on a spectral band, which is
illustrated by our neurophysiological database.

ARX gene mutations have been known as important causes of developmental and
neurological disorders and are responsible for a large spectrum of abnormal
phenotypes, includeing syndromic as well as nonsyndromic forms of mental
retardation. We have screened the entire coding and flanking intronic sequences
of ARX gene in 143 mentally impaired males in order to investigate the
contribution of ARX mutations to mental retardation in the population of Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Three sequence variants were identified: one patient had the
most recurrent mutation already observed in ARX gene, the c.428_451dup(24 bp),
two patients presented the c.1347C>T (p.G449G) in exon 4, and one patient had the
intronic variant c.1074-3T>C. Although two of these alterations were considered
polymorphisms, the known pathogenic variant c.428_451dup(24 bp) was found at a
high rate (4.8%) among X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) families. Our results, 
the first in Latin America, reinforce the idea that ARX mutations are relevant to
mental retardation and are indicative that molecular screening of exon 2 should
be considered in males with mental retardation of unknown etiology, associated or
not with neurological manifestations, especially in familial cases.

The influence of etiology upon ictal semiology, treatment decisions and long-term
outcomes in infantile spasms and West syndrome.

Maudlin Street, Bristol BS2 8BJ, UK. allux@dialstart.net

Studying infantile spasms is challenging because there are so many aspects of
variation that introduce potential bias. These might relate to the many
underlying etiologies, and variations in clinical semiology and
electroencephalographic features that relate more to age or timing of
investigation than to the underlying epilepsy or seizures type. New gene defects 
associated with the CDKL5/STK9 and ARX genes are associated with infantile
spasms, but these illustrate that, when studying neurodevelopmental outcomes, it 
is necessary to deal also with heterogeneity at the level of genotype-phenotype
correlation. We discuss these design issues with consideration of data from the
United Kingdom infantile spasms study (UKISS)--in which neurodevelopmental
outcomes show evidence of an interaction between underlying etiologic
classification and randomised treatment--and with consideration to proposals on
study design from the recent consensus statement of the West Delphi group. In the
continual debate about whether we should "lump" or "split" when studying epilepsy
syndromes, we propose the adoption of study designs using valid and consistent
methods that permit both lumping and splitting.

index and the A-line ARX index.

Barcelona, Spain.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to prospectively test the Cerebral
State Index designed for measuring the depth of anesthesia. The Cerebral State
Index is calculated using a fuzzy logic combination of four subparameters of the 
electroencephalographic signal. The performance of the Cerebral State Index was
compared with that of the Bispectral Index and the A-Line ARX Index.
METHODS: This study applied raw data from two previously published clinical
protocols. The patients in protocol 1 were given a continuous propofol infusion, 
300 ml/h, until 80% of burst suppression occurred. In protocol 2, a stepwise
increased target-controlled infusion of propofol was administered to patients
until loss of response to noxious stimuli while the Observer's Assessment of
Alertness and Sedation was registered every 4 min. The Cerebral State Index was
calculated off-line from the recorded electroencephalographic data. The Spearman 
rank correlation coefficient between electronic indices and the effect site
concentration of propofol was calculated along with the prediction probability of
each index to predict the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation level.
RESULTS: The Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the Cerebral State
Index, Bispectral Index, and A-Line ARX Index and the propofol effect site
concentration were -0.94, -0.89, and -0.82, respectively, in protocol 1, whereas 
the prediction probability values between the Cerebral State Index, Bispectral
Index, and A-Line ARX Index and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and
Sedation score in protocol 2 were 0.92, 0.93, and 0.91, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The Cerebral State Index detects well the graduated levels of
propofol anesthesia when compared with the propofol effect site concentration and
the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score.

A new paradigm for West syndrome based on molecular and cell biology.

Symptomatic West syndrome has heterogeneous backgrounds. Recently, two novel
genes, ARX and CDKL5, have been found to be responsible for cryptogenic West
syndrome or infantile spasms. Both are located in the human chromosome Xp22
region and are mainly expressed and play roles in fetal brain. Moreover, several 
genes responsible for brain malformations including lissencephaly, which is
frequently associated with West syndrome or infantile spasms, have been found,
and the mechanisms responsible for the neural network disorders in these brain
malformations are rapidly being determined. Findings of animal and in vitro
studies and mutation analyses in humans are delineating the molecular and
cellular basis of West syndrome. Mutations of the ARX gene controlling the
development of GABAergic interneurons exhibit pleiotropic effects including
lissencephaly with a strong genotype-phenotype correlation. An expansion mutation
of the first polyalanine tract of ARX is more strongly related to infantile
spasms than is that of the second polyalanine tract. Although the phenotype of
CDKL5 mutation is similar to Rett syndrome caused by MECP2 mutation, the former
is characterized by early-onset seizures and association with West syndrome.
Lissencephaly caused by LIS1 or DCX mutation frequently results in West syndrome,
while lissencephaly due to ARX mutation is associated with the most severe form
of epilepsy but never results in West syndrome nor infantile spasms. Both LIS1
and DCX participate in the development of GABAergic interneurons as well as
pyramidal neurons, while ARX participates only in that of interneurons.
Individuals with lissencephaly due to ARX mutation lack non-pyramidal or
GABAergic interneurons. ARX is crucial for the development of GABAergic
interneuron, so abnormal interneurons in patients with ARX mutation are thought
to be implicated in the pathological mechanism, even though brain MRI is normal. 
Abnormal interneurons appear to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of
West syndrome or infantile spasms, which can be considered an interneuronopathy.

[Peculiarities of growth and development of strains Hormoconis resinae (Lindau)
V. arx & De Vries F. Resinae and Cladosporium sphaerospermum penz].

[Article in Russian]

Pavlichenko AK, Zhdanova NN.

The work deals with the effect of limitation of organic carbon (glucose) on the
growth and morphology of two species of microscopic fungi Hormoconis resinae and 
Cladosporium sphaerospermum (11 strains), isolated from premises of the 4th unit 
of the Chernobyl NPP and isolation places which arc pure from radionuclides. The 
dissimilar reaction of each of the species to decreasing the amount of organic
carbon in the culture medium has been established. Ontogenesis reduction was
observed for both species under the conditions of limitations of organic carbon. 
In was manifested for H. resinae in reduction of the typical conidial sporulation
and in transition to micelial way of existence, and only conidial sporulation and
formation of "empty" micelium Were registered under such conditions for C.
sphaerospermum. The studied strains were related to 3 ecologic groups by
oligocarbotolerance criterion: typical saprotrophs, intermediate group, strains
with a tendency to oligocarbotolerance.

progress kinetic analysis.

This Perspective highlights how the methodology of reaction progress kinetic
analysis can provide a rapid and comprehensive kinetic profile of complex
catalytic reaction networks under synthetically relevant conditions in a fraction
of the number of experiments required by classical kinetic analysis. This
approach relies on graphical manipulation of the extensive data sets available
from accurate in situ monitoring of reaction progress under conditions where two 
concentration variables are changing simultaneously. A series of examples from
Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions of aryl halides demonstrates how a wealth of
kinetic information may be extracted from just three experiments in each case.
Even before proposing a reaction mechanism, we can determine reaction orders in
substrates, propose a resting state for the catalyst, and probe catalyst
stability. Carrying out this kinetic analysis at the outset of a mechanistic
investigation provides a framework for further work aimed at seeking a
molecular-level understanding of the nature of the species within the catalytic
cycle. To be considered plausible, any independent mechanistic proposal must be
shown to be consistent with this global kinetic analysis.

Accumulation of intracellular lipid may contribute to defective insulin secretion
in type 2 diabetes. Although Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF; fa/fa) rat islets are
fat-laden and overexpress the lipogenic master gene, sterol regulatory element
binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), the contribution of SREBP-1c to the secretory
defects observed in this model remains unclear. Here we compare the gene
expression profile of lean control (fa/+) and ZDF rat islets in the absence or
presence of dominant-negative SREBP-1c (SREBP-1c DN). ZDF islets displayed
elevated basal insulin secretion at 3 mmol/l glucose but a severely depressed
response to 17 mmol/l glucose. While SREBP-1c DN reduced basal insulin secretion 
from ZDF islets, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was not improved. Of 57
genes differentially regulated in ZDF islets and implicated in glucose
metabolism, vesicle trafficking, ion fluxes, and/or exocytosis, 21 were
upregulated and 5 were suppressed by SREBP-1c DN. Genes underrepresented in ZDF
islets were either unaffected (Glut-2, Kir6.2, Rab3), stimulated
(voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel subunit alpha1D, CPT2, SUR2, rab9, syt13), or
inhibited (syntaxin 7, secretogranin-2) by SREBP-1c inhibition. Correspondingly, 
SREBP-1c DN largely corrected decreases in the expression of the transcription
factors Pdx-1 and MafA but did not affect the abnormalities in Pax6, Arx, hepatic
nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1alpha), HNF3beta/Forkhead box-a2 (Foxa2), inducible
cyclic AMP early repressor (ICER), or transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2)
expression observed in ZDF islets. We conclude that upregulation of SREBP-1c and 
mild increases in triglyceride content do not explain defective
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from ZDF rats. However, overexpression of
SREBP-1c may contribute to enhanced basal insulin secretion in this model.

Most gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons in the neocortex and hippocampus
are derived from subpallial progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminence and
migrate tangentially to the pallium, where they differentiate into a diverse set 
of neuronal subtypes. Toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying the generation
of interneuron diversity, we have studied in mice the expression patterns in
differentiating and mature neocortical interneurons of 8 transcription factors,
including 6 homeobox (Dlx1, Dlx2, Dlx5, Arx, Lhx6, Cux2), 1 basic
helix-loop-helix, (NPAS1), and 1 bZIP (MafB). Their patterns of expression change
during interneuron differentiation and show distinct distributions within
interneuron subpopulations in adult neocortex. This study is a first step to
define the combinatorial codes of transcription factors that participate in
regulating the specification and function of cortical interneuron subtypes.

The recently identified gene ARX (Aristalles-Related Homeobox) codifies the ARX
protein, an important transcript factor that belongs to one of the three largest 
classes of homeoproteins, the paired (Prd) class. Several mutations have been
identified in ARX gene, which is responsible for a wide spectrum of phenotypes,
including syndromic as well as non syndromic forms of mental retardation. One of 
the mutations, the c.428-451 dup (24 bp) is the most frequent identified in the
ARX gene. This duplication leads to an expansion of the second polyalanine tract 
of ARX protein. We have reported the identification of a Brazilian family
segregating the c.428-451 dup (24 bp) in ARX gene.

The malformations of the cerebral cortex represent a major cause of developmental
disabilities, severe epilepsy and reproductive disadvantage. The advent of
high-resolution MRI techniques has facilitated the in vivo identification of a
large group of cortical malformation phenotypes. Several malformation syndromes
caused by abnormal cortical development have been recognised and specific
causative gene defects have been identified. Periventricular nodular heterotopia 
(PNH) is a malformation of neuronal migration in which a subset of neurons fails 
to migrate into the developing cerebral cortex. X-linked PNH is mainly seen in
females and is often associated with focal epilepsy. FLNA mutations have been
reported in all familial cases and in about 25% of sporadic patients. A rare
recessive form of PNH due ARGEF2 gene mutations has also been reported in
children with microcephaly, severe delay and early seizures.
Lissencephaly-pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) are disorders of 
neuronal migration and represent a malformative spectrum resulting from mutations
of either LIS1 or DCX genes. LIS1 mutations cause a more severe malformation in
the posterior brain regions. Most children have severe developmental delay and
infantile spasms, but milder phenotypes are on record, including posterior SBH
owing to mosaic mutations of LIS1. DCX mutations usually cause anteriorly
predominant lissencephaly in males and SBH in female patients. Mutations of DCX
have also been found in male patients with anterior SBH and in female relatives
with normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Autosomal recessive lissencephaly
with cerebellar hypoplasia, accompanied by severe delay, hypotonia, and seizures,
has been associated with mutations of the reelin (RELN) gene. X-linked
lissencephaly with corpus callosum agenesis and ambiguous genitalia in genotypic 
males is associated with mutations of the ARX gene. Affected boys have severe
delay and seizures with suppression-burst EEG. Early death is frequent. Carrier
female patients can have isolated corpus callosum agenesis. Among several
syndromes featuring polymicrogyria, bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria shows
genetic heterogeneity, including linkage to chromosome Xq28 in some pedigrees,
autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance in others, and an association with
chromosome 22q11.2 deletion in some patients. About 65% of patients have severe
epilepsy. Recessive bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria has been associated
with mutations of the GPR56 gene. Epilepsy is often present in patients with
cortical malformations and tends to be severe, although its incidence and type
vary in different malformations. It is estimated that up to 40% of children with 
drug-resistant epilepsy have a cortical malformation. However, the
physiopathological mechanisms relating cortical malformations to epilepsy remain 
elusive.

Growth characteristics of Hormoconis resinae (Lindau) von Arx & de Vries,
isolated from premises of the 4th unit of the Chernobyl NPP were studied on solid
and liquid media. Radial growth rate of the studied strains varied from 0.05 to
0.08 mm an hour and did not depend on radioactivity of isolation place and
composition of the nutrient medium. Index of substrate I colonizing intensity has
demonstrated that all studied strains grew better on nutrient-rich medium.
Morphological changes in studied strains on starving nutrient-poor media showed a
decrease of biomass accumulation, reduction of sporogenesis, inhibition of
micelial growth. Concerning both characteristic of biomass accumulation and
morphological changes, all studied strains were referred to 3 groups: (1)
heterotrophic strains, (2) strains with a tendency to oligocarbotolerance, (3)

The Aristaless-related homeobox gene, ARX, is an important transcription factor
with a crucial role in forebrain, pancreas and testes development. At least
fifty-nine mutations have been described in the ARX gene in seven X-chromosome
linked disorders involving mental retardation. Recent studies with ARX screening 
suggest that the gene is mutated in 9.5% of X-linked families with these
disorders. Two different polyalanine expansion mutations represent 46% of all
currently known mutations and show considerable pleiotropy. The ARX gene is
emerging as one of the more important disease-causing genes on the X chromosome
and ought to be considered for routine screening. Although the normal Arx protein
is known to be a bifunctional transcriptional activator and repressor, the
complete biochemical characterization of the normal and mutated ARX awaits
further investigation. Pax4 was identified as one of the ARX target genes, and
both proteins have crucial functions in endocrine mouse pancreas alpha-cell and
beta-cell lineage specification.

Anesthesiologist-controlled versus patient-controlled propofol sedation for
shockwave lithotripsy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, King Abdulaziz University
Hospital, P.O. Box 31648, Jeddah 21418, Saudi Arabia. jalhashemi@kau.edu.sa

PURPOSE: To compare anesthesiologist-controlled sedation (ACS) with
patient-controlled sedation (PCS), with respect to propofol requirements,
sedation, and recovery, in patients undergoing extracorporeal shockwave
lithotripsy for urinary calculi.
METHODS: Sixty-four patients were randomized, in this double-blind study, to
receive propofol sedation according to one of two regimens: infusion of 200
microg.kg(-1) .min(-1) for ten minutes reduced thereafter to 50-150 microg.kg(-1)
.min(-1) titrated by an anesthesiologist, according to patient response (group
ACS), or propofol administered by patient-controlled analgesia (bolus dose 300
microg.kg(-1), lockout interval three minutes, no basal infusion), (group PCS).
All patients received midazolam 10 microg.kg(-1) iv and fentanyl 1 microg.kg(-1) 
iv preoperatively, followed by fentanyl infused at a rate of 0.5 microg.kg(-1)
.hr(-1) throughout the procedure. Sedation and analgesia were assessed using the 
A-line ARX index and visual analogue scale, respectively. Psychomotor recovery
and readiness for recovery room discharge were assessed using the Trieger dot
test and postanesthesia discharge score, respectively. Patient satisfaction was
assessed on a seven-point scale (1-7).
RESULTS: In comparison to group PCS, patients in group ACS received more propofol
(398 +/- 162 mg vs 199 +/- 68 mg, P < 0.001), were more sedated (A-line ARX
index: 35 +/- 16 vs 73 +/- 16, P < 0.001), experienced less pain (visual analogue
scale: 0 +/- 0 vs 3 +/- 1, P < 0.001), and were more satisfied (median [Q1, Q3]: 
7 [7, 7] vs 6 [6, 7], P < 0.001). In contrast, patients in group PCS had faster
psychomotor recovery (Trieger dot test median [Q1, Q3]: 8 [4, 16] vs 16 [12, 26] 
dots missed, P = 0.002) and achieved postanesthesia discharge score >/=9 earlier 
(median [Q1, Q3]: 40 [35, 60] vs 88 [75, 100] min, P < 0.001) compared with group
ACS.
CONCLUSION: In comparison to PCS for patients undergoing extracorporeal shockwave
lithotripsy, propofol/fentanyl ACS is associated with increased propofol
administration, deeper sedation levels, and greater patient comfort. However, ACS
is associated with slower recovery and a longer time to meet discharge criteria, 
when compared to PCS.

A series of new complexes [(L-L)Pd(Ar)(CF3)] (L-L = dppe, dppp, tmeda; Ar = Ph,
p-Tol, C6D5) have been synthesized and fully characterized in solution and in the
solid state. Remarkable Ph-X activation (X = I, Cl) by [(dppe)Pd(Ph)(CF3)] (1)
has been found to come about to cleanly produce biphenyl and [(dppe)Pd(Ph)(X)].
This reaction does not take place under rigorously anhydrous conditions but in
the presence of traces of water it readily occurs, exhibiting an induction period
and being zero order in PhI. As shown by mechanistic studies, the role of water
is to promote reduction of small quantities of the Pd(II) complex to Pd(0) which 
activates the Ph-X bond. Subsequent transmetalation to give diphenyl Pd
complexes, followed by Ph-Ph reductive elimination give rise to the observed
products. The water-induced reduction to catalytically active Pd(0) has been
demonstrated to proceed via both the Pd(II)/P(III) to Pd(0)/P(V) redox mechanism 
and alpha-F transfer, followed by facile hydrolysis of the difluorocarbene to
carbonyl, migratory insertion, and reductive elimination of PhC(X)O (X = F, OH,
or OOCPh). In the absence of H2O and ArX, the diphosphine-stabilized
trifluoromethyl Pd phenyl complexes undergo slow Ph-CF3 reductive elimination
under reinforcing conditions (xylenes, 145 degrees C).

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) on auto regressive
with exogenous input model (ARX-model) auditory evoked index (AAI) in patients
anesthetized with different anesthetics.
METHODS: Forty-eight adult patients undergoing scheduled surgical operation were 
enrolled and divided into two groups (24 in each group) according to the
anesthetics applied, Group A was anesthetized with propofol sedation and Group B 
with Isoflurane-epidural anesthesia. Group A was subdivided into three groups of 
low, middle and high concentration of target effect-site of 1.0 microg/ml, 1.5
microg/ml and 2.0 microg/ml through target controlled infusion (TCI) and Group B 
into 3 subgroups of minimum alveolar effective concentration of isoflurane (0.4
MAC, 0.6 MAC and 0.8 MAC for B1, B2 and B3 subgroups) respectively, with 8
patients in every subgroup. EA on acupoints of Hegu (LI4) and Neiguan (P6) was
applied on all the patients during anesthesia, and the change of AAI at various
time points was recorded.
RESULTS: In the three subgroups of Group A, levels of AAI were significantly
elevated in the first few minutes after EA, and significantly lowered 20 min
after EA in subgroup A2. While in the subgroups of Group B, except the elevating 
in Group B1 1-2 min after EA, levels of AAI remained unchanged at other time
points.
CONCLUSION: Pain response could be reflected by AAI during EA. EA could enhance
the sedative effect of propofol in middle concentration, but its effect on
isoflurane epidural anesthesia is insignificant.

The ARX gene mutations have been demonstrated to cause different forms of mental 
retardation (MR). Beside FMR1, in families with X-linked mental retardation
(XLMR), the ARX dysfunction was demonstrated to be among the most frequent causes
of this heterogeneous group of disorders. Nevertheless, in sporadic cases of MR, 
ARX mutations are extremely rare. In order to evaluate the frequency of ARX
mutation in XLMR, we performed mutational analysis of ARX in 165 mentally
retarded probands negative for FRAXA and belonging to families in which the
condition segregates as an X-linked condition. The same recurrent mutation, an in
frame 24 bp insertion (c.428-451 dup (24 bp)), was identified in five patients.
In one family, the mother of two affected boys was found not to carry the
mutation detected in her sons. These data suggest the presence of germline
mosaicism for the mutation in the mother. Our results confirm the significant
contribution of ARX mutations in the etiology of MR, especially in this group of 
patients selected for XLMR (3%). These data, together with those reported in the 
literature, imply that screening for c.428-451 dup (24 bp) mutation should be
recommended in all patients with suspected XLMR.

The role of ARX in cortical development.

The ARX protein (encoded by the aristaless-related homeobox gene) is a member of 
the paired class of homeoproteins. More precisely, it is a member of the
Aristaless subclass of proteins with a glutamine residue (Q) at the critical
position 50 of the homeodomain (Q50). Through identification of diverse inherited
or de novo mutations, genetic investigations of X-linked mental retardation
conditions have demonstrated the implication of ARX in a wide spectrum of
disorders extending from phenotypes with severe neuronal migration defects, such 
as lissencephaly, to mild forms of X-linked mental retardation without apparent
brain abnormalities. These investigations have recently directed attention to the
role of this gene in brain development. Analysis of its spatiotemporal
localization profile have revealed expression mainly in telencephalic structures 
at all stages of development. Interestingly, in adult, ARX expression becomes
restricted to a population of GABAergic neurons. Although the identification of
the target genes regulated by ARX remains a crucial step to better understanding 
its role during brain development, studies of the role of ARX orthologs in
different models have indicated that it is essential for important developmental 
processes such as proliferation, cell differentiation and neuronal migration.

IA1 is NGN3-dependent and essential for differentiation of the endocrine
pancreas.

Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) is key for endocrine cell specification in the embryonic
pancreas and induction of a neuroendocrine cell differentiation program by
misexpression in adult pancreatic duct cells. We identify the gene encoding IA1, 
a zinc-finger transcription factor, as a direct target of Ngn3 and show that it
forms a novel branch in the Ngn3-dependent endocrinogenic transcription factor
network. During embryonic development of the pancreas, IA1 and Ngn3 exhibit
nearly identical spatio-temporal expression patterns. However, embryos lacking
Ngn3 fail to express IA1 in the pancreas. Upon ectopic expression in adult
pancreatic duct cells Ngn3 binds to chromatin in the IA1 promoter region and
activates transcription. Consistent with this direct effect, IA1 expression is
normal in embryos mutant for NeuroD1, Arx, Pax4 and Pax6, regulators operating
downstream of Ngn3. IA1 is an effector of Ngn3 function as inhibition of IA1
expression in embryonic pancreas decreases the formation of insulin- and
glucagon-positive cells by 40%, while its ectopic expression amplifies
neuroendocrine cell differentiation by Ngn3 in adult duct cells. IA1 is therefore
a novel Ngn3-regulated factor required for normal differentiation of pancreatic
endocrine cells.

[Non-specific X-linked mental retardation].

[Article in Spanish]

INTRODUCTION: Non-specific mental retardation is defined by the absence of
somatic, neurological, biochemical or behavioural features that characterise a
particular clinical variant and accounts for a large percentage of cases of
X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Genetic linkage studies showed it to have a
high rate of genetic heterogeneity.
DEVELOPMENT: To date, genetic linkage studies or the characterisation of
chromosomal rearrangement in patients have allowed 22 different genes to be
identified. Some of the most notable of these are the genes responsible for
syndromic forms, such as RPS6KA3, ARX, JARID1C, XNP or MeCP2, in which the
mildest mutations, with a certain amount of functional activity, cause
non-specific retardation. The proteins these genes code for are directly or
indirectly involved in regulating the expression of other genes. Moreover, genes 
such as OPHN1, PAK3, ARHGEF6, FGD1 or TM4SF2 code for proteins that interact with
rho GTPases, and play a role in the transmission of signals that regulate the
development of axons and dendrites. Other types of functions of the known genes
include establishing and modulating synapses (DLG3, IL1RAPL, NLGN4X, GDI1),
regulating transcription (ZNF41, ZNF81, PQBP1) translation (FTSJ1), and fatty
acid metabolism (FACL4), etc.
CONCLUSIONS: Each gene that has been identified only accounts for a minor
fraction of the total amount of XLMR, and even if taken together they still do
not explain half the cases of non-specific XLMR. The number of XLMR genes is
expected to rise in coming years with the development of new techniques that will
facilitate diagnosis and genetic counselling in the relatively near future.

INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: The term X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) refers 
to a heterogeneous group of conditions that, on the basis of their presenting
symptoms, have traditionally been classified as being syndromic (SMR) and
non-syndromic or non-specific (XMR). The prevalence of XLMR in males is estimated
to be 10%, excluding fragile X syndrome, which is the most common monogenic
cause. There are over 100 genes involved in XLMR. In this work we review some of 
the phenotypes and genes involved in SMR. A small stature and coarse features
indicate a suspected case of Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is secondary to
mutations of the RPS6KA3 or RSK2 genes. Cerebellar hypoplasia points towards
alterations of the OPHN1 gene. In males with coarse features and genital
abnormalities screening for alpha thalassemia must be carried out; this
association results from mutations in the ATRX gene. Of the genes involved in
mental retardation and epilepsy, the most notable are SLC6A8 (which triggers a
deficit in creatine transport when altered and which is easily detected with
respect to its biochemistry) and ARX (also associated to lissencephaly and
dystonia of the hands). Mutations in the PQBP1 and JARID1C genes have been
identified in patients with mental retardation associated to microcephaly and
short stature. A high level of T3 hormone points towards defects in the SLC16A2
gene. Some of these genes have also been implicated in XMR, which makes this
distinction less clear molecularly speaking.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of all the genes involved in XLMR is not
possible in clinical praxis today. It is important to search for differential
phenotypic features in males with mental retardation that guide the study towards
specific genes. Identification of the molecular defect will allow for correct
genetic counselling. DNA microarrays for the study of different mutations in a
large number of genes involved in mental retardation are the great hope for the
future.

PURPOSE: We have labelled hypericin, a polyphenolic polycyclic quinone found in
St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), with( 123)I and evaluated
mono-[(123)I]iodohypericin (MIH) as a potential necrosis-avid diagnostic tracer
agent.
METHODS: MIH was prepared by an electrophilic radioiodination method. The new
tracer agent was evaluated in animal models of liver infarction in the rat and
heart infarction in the rabbit using single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT), triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) histochemical staining, serial
sectional autoradiography and microscopy, and radioactivity counting techniques.
RESULTS: Using in vivo SPECT imaging, hepatic and cardiac infarctions were
persistently visualised as well-defined hot spots over 48 h. Preferential uptake 
of the tracer agent in necrotic tissue was confirmed by perfect match of images
from post-mortem TTC staining, autoradiography (ARX) and histology. Radioactivity
concentration in infarcted tissues was over 10 times (liver; 3.51% ID/g in
necrotic tissue vs 0.38% ID/g in normal tissue at 60 h p.i.) and over 6 times
(myocardium; 0.36% ID/g in necrotic tissue vs 0.054% ID/g in normal tissue;
ratios up to 18 for selected parts on ARX images) higher than in normal tissues.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that hypericin derivatives may serve as powerful 
necrosis-avid diagnostic agents for assessment of tissue viability.

Linear aspects of transformation from interictal epileptic discharges to BOLD
fMRI signals in an animal model of occipital epilepsy.

Epileptic disorders manifest with seizures and interictal epileptic discharges
(IEDs). The hemodynamic changes that accompany IEDs are poorly understood and may
be critical for understanding epileptogenesis. Despite a known linear coupling of
the neurovascular elements in normal brain tissues, previous simultaneous
electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
have shown variable correlations between epileptic discharges and blood
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, partly because most previous studies
assumed particular hemodynamic properties in normal brain tissue. The occurrence 
of IEDs in human subjects is unpredictable. Therefore, an animal model with
reproducible stereotyped IEDs was developed by the focal injection of penicillin 
into the right occipital cortex of rats anesthetized with isoflurane.
Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was used to study the hemodynamic changes during IEDs. A
hybrid of temporal independent component analysis (ICA) of EEG and spatial ICA of
fMRI data was used to correlate BOLD fMRI signals with IEDs. A linear
autoregression with exogenous input (ARX) model was used to estimate the
hemodynamic impulse response function (HIRF) based on the data from simultaneous 
EEG-fMRI measurement. Changes in the measured BOLD signal from the right primary 
visual cortex and bilateral visual association cortices were consistently coupled
to IEDs. The linear ARX model was applied here to confirm that a linear transform
can be used to study the correlation between BOLD signal and its corresponding
neural activity in this animal model of occipital epilepsy.

Endodontic surgery, and in particular periapical surgery, has seen a significant 
development in the last few years, mainly following the introduction of
microsurgical principles and the use of magnification devices. The successful
outcome of periapical surgery, however, is based on the quality of the root-end
obturation that should prevent any reinfection originating from the root canal.
Since amalgam as a root-end sealing material was abandoned many years ago, a
great diversity of obturation techniques and materials have been described.
Besides the standard root-end cavity preparation with microtips, the author today
has a preference for the Retroplast-technique. The paper describes this technique
in detail and reports the possibilities and limits of this obturation method.

Objective selection of signals for assessment of cerebral blood flow
autoregulation in neonates.

Ramos EG(1), Simpson DM, Panerai RB, Nadal J, Lopes JM, Evans DH.

Author information:

Janeiro, Brazil.

A number of different system identification techniques have been proposed to
assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation in critically ill patients. From these
methods, the response to a standard stepwise change in blood pressure can be
estimated. Responses lacking physiological consistency are a common occurrence
and could be the consequence of particular system identification procedures or,
alternatively, caused by measurements with a poor signal-to-noise ratio. A
multi-observer approach was adopted in this paper to classify cerebral blood flow
velocity (CBFV) step responses to spontaneous changes in arterial blood pressure 
in a group of 43 neonates with a mean gestational age of 33.7 weeks (range 24-42 
weeks) and a mean birthweight of 1,980 g (range 570-3,910 g). Three experienced
observers independently analysed the estimated step responses in 191 recordings
each lasting 100 s; for an autoregressive (ARX) model, 124 (65%) of the step
responses were accepted by at least two of the three observers. Two other system 
identification methods, transfer function analysis and the moving average
Wiener-Laguerre model, gave 90 (45%) and 98 (51%) acceptable responses,
respectively. Only 54 epochs (28%) were accepted with all three methods. With 88 
(46%) responses rejected by at least two methods, it can be concluded that signal
quality was the main reason for nonphysiological step responses. To avoid the
need for subjective visual selection, an automatic procedure for classifying step
responses was implemented leading to sensitivities and specificities in the range
85-90%, with respect to the agreement with subjective evaluations. Objective
selection of CBFV step responses is thus feasible and could also be adapted for
other physiological measurement techniques relying on system identification
methods.

CDKL5/Stk9 kinase inactivation is associated with neuronal developmental
disorders.

(1)Department of Neurobiology, Pharmacology and Physiology, and Ben May Institute
for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5 or STK9) has recently been
implicated in atypical Rett and X-linked West syndromes, severe neurological
disorders associated with mental retardation, loss of communication and motor
skills and infantile spasms and seizures in predominantly females. Besides CDKL5,
these disease phenotypes are also linked to mutations in the MECP2 and ARX genes.
Here, we have expressed and characterized CDKL5 and its mutant forms. CDKL5 is a 
118 kDa protein that is widely distributed in all tissues, with highest levels in
brain, thymus and testes. Whole mount embryo staining reveals CDKL5 to be
ubiquitous. Within cells, CDKL5 is localized primarily in the nucleus. Removal of
the C-terminal domain increases CDKL5 expression, enhances autophosphorylation
activity and causes perinuclear localization, indicating that the C-terminus
regulates CDKL5 function. Although we detect MeCP2 but not ARX binding to CDKL5, 
our results suggest that neither of these proteins are direct substrates of the
CDKL5 kinase. Finally, the CDKL5 mutations associated with the disease phenotype 
cause loss of kinase activity as assessed by autophosphorylation. These results
suggest that inactivation of the CDKL5 kinase can lead to severe
neurodevelopmental disorders.

X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 1.8 per thousand male births and is
usually categorized as "syndromic" (MRXS) or "non-specific" (MRX) forms according
to the presence or absence of specific signs in addition to the MR. Up to 60
genes have been implicated in XLMR and certain mutations can alternatively lead
to MRXS or MRX. Indeed the extreme phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity of XLMR
makes the classification of most genes difficult. Therefore, following
identification of new genes, accurate retrospective clinical evaluation of
patients and their families is necessary to aid the molecular diagnosis and the
classification of this heterogeneous group of disorders. Analyses of the protein 
products corresponding to XLMR genes show a great diversity of cellular pathways 
involved in MR. Common mechanisms are beginning to emerge : a first group of
proteins belongs to the Rho and Rab GTPase signaling pathways involved in
neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity and a second group is related to
the regulation of gene expression. In this review, we illustrate the complexity
of XLMR conditions and present recent data about the FMR1, ARX and Oligophrenin 1
genes.

Mutations in the human ARX gene have been shown to cause nonsyndromic X-linked
mental retardation (MRX) as well as syndromic forms such as X-linked
lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), Partington syndrome and X-linked
infantile spasm. The most common causative mutation, a duplication of 24 bp, was 
found in families with a variety of phenotypes, but not in the more severe XLAG
phenotypes. The aim of the study was to access the frequency of ARX mutations in 
families with established or putative X-linked mental retardation (XLMR)
collected by the European XLMR Consortium. We screened the entire coding region
of ARX for mutations in 197 novel XLMR families by denaturing high-performance
liquid chromatography, and we identified eight mutations (six c.428_451dup24, one
insertion and one novel missense mutation p.P38S). To better define the
prevalence of ARX mutations, we included previously reported results of 157 XLMR 
families. Together, these data showed the relatively high rate (9.5%) of ARX
mutations in X-linked MR families and an expectedly low rate in families with
affected brother pairs (2.2%). This study confirms that the frequency of ARX
mutations is high in XLMR, and the analysis of ARX in MRX should not be limited
to duplication.

Genotypically defined lissencephalies show distinct pathologies.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA, and Department of Neurology, Radcliffe
Infirmary, Oxford, UK.

Lissencephaly is traditionally divided into 2 distinct pathologic forms: classic 
(type I) and cobblestone (type II). To date, mutations in 4 genes, LIS1, DCX,
RELN, and ARX, have been associated with distinct type I lissencephaly syndromes.
Each of these genes has been shown to play a role in normal cell migration,
consistent with the presumed pathogenesis of type I lissencephaly. Based on these
data, we hypothesized that all forms of radiographically defined type I
lissencephaly independent of genotype would be pathologically similar. To test
this hypothesis, we examined brains from 16 patients, including 15 lissencephalic
patients and one patient with subcortical band heterotopia. Of these 16 patients,
6 had LIS1 deletions, 2 had DCX mutations, and 2 had ARX mutations. In addition, 
6 patients had no defined genetic defect, although the patient with subcortical
band heterotopia exhibited the same pattern of malformation expected with an XLIS
mutation. In all cases, the cortex was thickened; however, the topographic
distribution of the cortical pathology varied, ranging from frontal- to
occipital-biased pathology to diffuse involvement of the neocortex. Although
brains with LIS1 deletions exhibited the classic 4-layer lissencephalic
architecture, patients with DCX and ARX mutations each had unique
cytoarchitectural findings distinct from LIS1. Furthermore, 2 of the 5 patients
with no known genetic defect showed a fourth type of histopathology characterized
by a 2-layered cortex. Interestingly, the 2 brains with the fourth type of
lissencephaly showed profound brainstem and cerebellar abnormalities. In summary,
we identified at least 4 distinct histopathologic subtypes of lissencephaly that 
stratify with the underlying genetic defect. Based on these data, a new
classification for lissencephaly is proposed that incorporates both pathologic
and genetic findings.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of desflurane on A-line ARX Index (AAI), QEEG, 
MAP and HR, and to investigate the feasibility of AAI, QEEG, MAP and HR in
monitoring the depth of anesthesia with desflurane.
METHODS: Thirty patients classified as ASA physical status I approximately II
were scheduled for elective lower abdominal surgery. Anesthesia was induced with 
propofol and vecuronum. After the tracheal intubation, the lungs were ventilated 
with desflurane in oxygen. End-tidal desflurane concentrations were maintained at
0.8, 1.0 and 1.3 MAC for 20 minutes, respectively. The parameters of record
included AAI, BIS (bispectral index), SEF (95% spectral edge freqency), MF
(midian freqency), MAP and HR.
RESULTS: AAI, BIS, SEF and MF significantly decreased in a linear manner (r =
0.830, 0.930, 0.803, and 0.885, respectively, P < 0.01) with increasing end-tidal
concentration of desflurane range of 0.8 approximately 1.3 MAC. MAP and HR did
not change much. HR increased significantly at concentration 1.3 MAC than that of
1.0 MAC.
CONCLUSION: Within end-tidal desflurane concentration range 0.8 approximately 1.3
MAC, both AAI and parameters derived from EEG (such as BIS, SEF, MF) can serve as
parameters in monitoring the depth of anesthsia with desflurane, while MAP and HR
can not.

Genetic determinants of pancreatic epsilon-cell development.

Recently, the expression of the peptide hormone ghrelin was detected in
alpha-cells of the islets of Langerhans as well as in epsilon-cells, a newly
discovered endocrine cell type, but it remains unclear how the latter is related 
in lineage to the four classical islet cell types, alpha-, beta-, delta-, and
PP-cells. Here, we provide further evidence that ghrelin is predominantly
produced in the alpha-cells of mouse islets but also in single hormone
ghrelin-secreting epsilon-cells. We additionally demonstrate that pancreatic
epsilon-cells derive from Neurogenin3-expressing precursor cells and their
genesis depends on Neurogenin3 activity. Furthermore, our data indicate that the 
number of ghrelin-producing cells is differentially regulated during pancreas
morphogenesis by the homeodomain-containing transcription factors Arx, Pax4, and 
Pax6. Arx mutants lack ghrelin+ glucagon+ alpha-cells whereas Pax4 mutants
develop an excess of these cells. Importantly, the ghrelin+ glucagon-
epsilon-cell population is not affected following Arx or Pax4 disruption. In
contrast, the loss of Pax6 provokes an unexpected increase of the ghrelin+
glucagon- epsilon-cell number which is not due to increased proliferation. Thus, 
we demonstrate that the development of ghrelin-producing cells is differentially 
dependent on Neurogenin3 in different domains of the gastrointestinal tract and
that, in the endocrine pancreas, epsilon-cell genesis does not require Arx or
Pax4 activities but is antagonized by Pax6.

Mental retardation is more common in males than females in the population,
assumed to be due to mutations on the X chromosome. The prevalence of the 24
genes identified to date is low and less common than expansions in FMR1, which
cause Fragile X syndrome. Systematic screening of all other X linked genes in X
linked families with mental retardation is currently not feasible in a clinical
setting. The phenotypes of genes causing syndromic and non-syndromic mental
retardation (NLGN3, NLGN4, RPS6KA3(RSK2), OPHN1, ATRX, SLC6A8, ARX, SYN1, AGTR2, 
MECP2, PQBP1, SMCX, and SLC16A2) are first discussed, as these may be the focus
of more targeted mutation analysis. Secondly, the relative prevalence of genes
causing only non-syndromic mental retardation (IL1RAPL1, TM4SF2, ZNF41, FTSJ1,
DLG3, FACL4, PAK3, ARHGEF6, FMR2, and GDI) is summarised. Thirdly, the problem of
recurrence risk where a molecular genetics diagnosis has not been made and what
proportion of the male excess of mental retardation is due to monogenic disorders
of the X chromosome are discussed.

Propofol ensures a more stable A-line ARX index than thiopental during
intubation.

Street, Kweishan, Taoyuan, Taiwan 333, R.O.C.

BACKGROUND: The A-line autoregressive modelling with exogenous input index (AAI) 
is a new method of assessing depth of anesthesia. We examined the effects of
tracheal intubation on the AAI and hemodynamics during induction of anesthesia
with propofol compared with thiopental in patients aged over 50 yr.
METHODS: 40 patients scheduled for a laminectomy, posterior spinal fusion,
vertebroplasty, or total hip replacement, ASA physical status I or II and aged
over 50 yr, were randomly divided into two groups. Thiopental 5 mg.kg(-1) iv,
fentanyl 2.5 microg.kg(-1) iv, and rocuronium 0.7 mg.kg(-1) iv were used in the
thiopental group (n = 20) for anesthetic induction; the same protocol was used in
the propofol group (n = 20) except that 2 mg.kg(-1) propofol iv was given instead
of thiopental. The AAI, non-invasive blood pressure, and heart rate were measured
every minute before induction for three minutes, at 1.5 min post-induction, and
then each minute post-intubation for eight minutes.
RESULTS: The AAI increased significantly at one and two minutes after intubation 
in the thiopental group (to 56.5 +/- 18.6 at 1 min and 44.7 +/- 18.7 at 2 min
after intubation vs 19.9 +/- 7.5 at 1.5 min after induction; P < 0.05).
Thereafter, AAI values gradually decreased three minutes after intubation. The
AAI was inhibited continuously after intubation in the propofol group, and no
significant elevation was seen.
CONCLUSION: Our results, using the AAI to monitor anesthetic depth during
induction and tracheal intubation, suggest that at equipotent doses propofol
provided a more stable level of anesthesia than did thiopental.

Combined general-epidural anesthesia decreases the desflurane requirement for
equivalent A-line ARX index in colorectal surgery.

Lu CH(1), Borel CO, Wu CT, Yeh CC, Jao SW, Chao PC, Wong CS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesiology, Tri-Service General Hospital and National
Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: The present study used the A-line ARX index, derived from auditory
evoked potential measurements, to examine the effect of epidural lidocaine on the
end-tidal concentration of desflurane during general anesthesia.
METHODS: Thirty ASA I-II patients scheduled for elective colorectal surgery were 
included and randomized, in a double-blinded fashion, to receive general
anesthesia, and 15 ml of either 2% lidocaine (group GE, n=15) or normal saline
(group GS, n=15) was administered epidurally with a maintenance infusion rate of 
6 ml h-1. After a 10-min high-flow oxygen wash-in period, desflurane was titrated
to a target A-line ARX index (AAI) of 20+/-5.
RESULTS: Epidural lidocaine reduced the end-tidal concentration of desflurane
required to maintain an adequate clinical effect by 42% compared to general
anesthesia alone (2.6% vs. 4.5%, respectively; P<0.001). The initial mean value
of AAI was 87.8 (range 78-99) in group GE and 88.13 (79-99) in group GS before
general anesthesia induction, the AAI values were approximately 19.7 (15-25) in
group GE and 20.2 (16-25) in group GS during anesthesia maintenance, and returned
to 84.53 (77-98) in group GE and 86.87 (79-98) in group GS when the patients
regained consciousness in the recovery room. No statistical difference in the AAI
values was observed either before, during, or after emergence of anesthesia. No
patient reported intraoperative awareness.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower-than-expected concentrations of volatile anesthetics are
sufficient to maintain appropriate a clinical anesthesia effect during combined
general-epidural anesthesia under auditory-evoked potential monitoring.

We describe two brothers with mental retardation (MR) due to a c.428_451dup24 in 
the ARX gene. The mother did not apparently carry the mutation, as determined by 
dHPLC and by fragment size analysis. Using semiquantitative fluorescent PCR, we
show however that 4% of her lymphocytes and 24% of her fibroblasts harbored the
duplication. We thus show that the mother displays somatic mosaicism for the
duplication thereby highlighting the need to reconsider the molecular screening
in sporadic cases of MR.

The Caenorhabditis elegans aristaless orthologue, alr-1, is required for
maintaining the functional and structural integrity of the amphid sensory organs.

(1)Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, Boulder, CO 80303, USA.

The homeobox-containing aristaless-related protein ARX has been directly linked
to the development of a number of human disorders involving mental retardation
and epilepsy and clearly plays a critical role in development of the vertebrate
central nervous system. In this work, we investigate the role of ALR-1, the
Caenorhabditis elegans aristaless orthologue, in amphid sensory function. Our
studies indicate that ALR-1 is required for maintenance of the amphid organ
structure throughout larval development. Mutant analysis indicates a progressive 
loss in the amphid neurons' ability to fill with lipophilic dyes as well as a
declining chemotactic response. The degeneration in amphid function corresponds
with a failure of the glial-like amphid socket cell to maintain its specific cell
shape and cell-cell contacts. Consistent with ALR-1 expression within the amphid 
socket cell, our results indicate a cell autonomous role for ALR-1 in maintaining
cell shape. Furthermore, we demonstrate a role for ALR-1 in the proper
morphogenesis of the anterior hypodermis. Genetic interaction tests also suggest 
that ALR-1 may function cooperatively with the cell adhesion processes in
maintaining the amphid sensory organs.

Pancreas development relies on a network of transcription factors belonging
mainly to the Homeodomain and basic Helix-Loop-Helix families. We show in this
study that, in zebrafish, sox4, a member of the SRY-like HMG-box (SOX) family, is
required for proper endocrine cell differentiation. We found that two genes
orthologous to mammalian Sox4 are present in zebrafish and that only one of them,
sox4b, is strongly expressed in the pancreatic anlage. Transcripts of sox4b were 
detected in mid-trunk endoderm from the 5-somite stage, well before the onset of 
expression of the early pancreatic gene pdx-1. Furthermore, by fluorescent double
in situ hybridization, we found that expression of sox4b is mostly restricted to 
precursors of the endocrine compartment. This expression is not maintained in
differentiated cells although transient expression can be detected in alpha cells
and some beta cells. That sox4b-expressing cells belong to the endocrine lineage 
is further illustrated by their absence from the pancreata of slow-muscle-omitted
mutant embryos, which specifically lack all early endocrine markers while
retaining expression of exocrine markers. The involvement of sox4b in cell
differentiation is suggested firstly by its up-regulation in mind bomb mutant
embryos displaying accelerated pancreatic cell differentiation. In addition,
sox4b knock-down leads to a drastic reduction in glucagon expression, while other
pancreatic markers including insulin, somatostatin, and trypsin are not
significantly affected. This disruption of alpha cell differentiation is due to
down-regulation of the homeobox arx gene specifically in the pancreas. Taken
together, these data demonstrate that, in zebrafish, sox4b is expressed
transiently during endocrine cell differentiation and plays a crucial role in the
generation of alpha endocrine cells.

X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a heterogeneous disorder that can be
classified as either non-specific (MRX), when mental retardation is the only
feature, or as syndromic mental retardation (MRXS). Genetic defects underlying
XLMR are being identified at a rapid pace, often starting from X-chromosomal
aberrations and XLMR families with a well-defined linkage interval. Here, we
present a new family with a syndromic form of XLMR, including mild mental
retardation, short stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism. Two-point linkage
analysis with 24 polymorphic markers spanning the entire X chromosome was carried
out. We could assign the causative gene to a 6 cM interval in Xp22.1-p21.3, with 
a maximum LOD score of 2.61 for markers DXS989 and DXS1061 at theta = 0.00. No
mutations were found in the presented family for two known MRX genes mapping to
this interval, ARX and IL1RAPL-1. These data indicate that the interval
Xp22.1-p21.3 contains at least one additional MRXS gene.

The performance of the activated sludge process is limited by the ability of the 
sedimentation tank (1) to separate the activated sludge from the treated effluent
and (2) to concentrate it. Apart from bad operating strategies or poorly designed
clarifiers, settling failures can mainly be attributed to filamentous bulking.
Image analysis is a promising technique that can be used for early detection of
filamentous bulking. The aim of this paper is therefore twofold. Foremost,
correlations are sought between image analysis information (i.e., the total
filament length per image, the mean form factor, the mean equivalent floc
diameter, the mean floc roundness and the mean floc reduced radius of gyration)
and classical measurements (i.e., the Sludge Volume Index (SVI)). Secondly, this 
information is both explored and exploited in order to identify dynamic ARX and
state space-type models. Their performance is compared based on two criteria.

Mutations in the CDKL5 gene (also known as STK9) have recently been shown to
cause early onset epilepsy and severe mental retardation (ISSX or West syndrome).
Patients with CDKL5 mutations sometimes also show features similar to those seen 
in Rett Syndrome (RTT). We have screened the CDKL5 gene in 94 patients with RTT
or a RTT-like phenotype who had tested negative for MECP2 mutations (13 classical
RTT female subjects, 25 atypical RTT female subjects, 40 RTT-like female and 16
RTT-like male subjects; 33 of the patients had early onset seizures). Novel
pathogenic CDKL5 mutations were identified in three girls, two of whom had
initially been diagnosed with the early onset seizure variant of RTT and the
other with early onset seizures and some features of RTT. In addition, the 33
patients with early seizures were screened for the most common mutations in the
ARX gene but none were found. Combining our three new cases with the previously
published cases, 13/14 patients with CDKL5 mutations presented with seizures
before the age of 3 months.

The follow up of patients with chronic liver diseases and the data from
multicentric clinical studies are affected by the variability of assay results
for the same parameter between the different laboratories. Today, the main
objective in clinical chemistry throughout the world is to harmonise the assay
results between the laboratories after the confirmation of their traceability, in
relation to defined reference systems. In this context, the purpose of our study 
was to verify the homogeneity of haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, total bilirubin,
GGT activity, ALAT activity results, which are combined in Fibrotest and
Actitest, between Dimension Analysers RXL, ARX and X-PAND (Dade Behring Society).
Moreover, we verified the transferability of Fibrotest and Actitest results
between the RXL, and either the BN2 (haptoglobin and apolipoprotein A1) or the
Modular DP (total bilirubin, GGT and ALAT activity concentrations). The serum
samples from 150 hospitalised patients were analysed on the different analysers. 
Specific protein assays were calibrated using solutions standardised against
reference material on Dimension and BN2 analysers. Total bilirubin assays were
performed by a diazoreaction on Dimension and Modular DP analysers. The GGT and
ALAT activity measurements on the Dimension analysers were performed in
accordance with the reference methods defined by the International Federation of 
Clinical Chemisty and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC). On the Modular, enzyme activity
measurements were performed according to the Szasz method (L-gamma-
glutamyl-4-nitroanilide as substrate) modified by Persijn and van der Slik
(L-gamma- glutamyl-3-carboxy- 4-nitroanilide as substrat) for GGT and according
to the IFCC specifications for ALAT. The methods of enzymatic activity
measurement were calibrated on the Modular only. Liver fibrosis and
necroinflammatory activity indices were determined using calculation algorithms, 
after having adjusted each component's result of Fibrotest and Actitest for
gender and age. Our study has shown, for each parameter, harmonious results
between the Dimension analysers and between RXL and BN2- Modular DP. Disregarding
alpha-2 macroglobulin which cannot be assayed on RXL, the results of Fibrotest
and Actitest were similar as performed on BN2- Modular DP and RXL.

The simultaneous loss of Arx and Pax4 genes promotes a somatostatin-producing

The specification of the different mouse pancreatic endocrine subtypes is
determined by the concerted activities of transcription factors. However, the
molecular mechanisms regulating endocrine fate allocation remain unclear. In the 
present study, we uncover the molecular consequences of the simultaneous
depletion of Arx and Pax4 activity during pancreas development. Our findings
reveal a so far unrecognized essential role of the paired-box-encoding Pax4 gene.
Specifically, in the combined absence of Arx and Pax4, an early-onset loss of
mature alpha- and beta-cells occurs in the endocrine pancreas, concomitantly with
a virtually exclusive generation of somatostatin-producing cells. Furthermore,
despite normal development of the PP-cells in the double-mutant embryos, an
atypical expression of the pancreatic polypeptide (PP) hormone was observed in
somatostatin-labelled cells after birth. Additional characterizations indicate
that such an expression of PP was related to the onset of feeding, thereby
unravelling an epigenetic control. Finally, our data provide evidence that both
Arx and Pax4 act as transcriptional repressors that control the expression level 
of one another, thereby mediating proper endocrine fate allocation.

Conidiogenesis of the type species and two additional species of the genus
Raffaelea Arx & Hennebert are described. In contrast to previous conclusions
based on light microscopy that indicate sympodial production of the conidia, we
found that conidium development was by annellidic percurrent proliferation in the
type species Raffaelea ambrosiae, as well as in Raffaelea arxii and Raffaelea
albimanens. Consequently, this mode of conidium development is similar to the
conidiogenesis of anamorphs within the Ophiostomatales, but distinguished by
sporodochia formed within the genus Raffaelea. These findings reduce the
differences between Raffaelea and other anamorphs with annellidic percurrent
proliferation of the conidiogenous cells within the Ophiostomatales to different 
conidiomata and conidiophores, and they support previous reports of the close
phylogenetic relationship between Raffaelea and Ophiostoma.

X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia as a tangential migration disorder
causing intractable epilepsy: proposal for a new term, "interneuronopathy".

Kato M(1), Dobyns WB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Yamagata University School of Medicine, Yamagata,

X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia is the first human disorder in
which deficient tangential migration in the brain has been demonstrated. Male
patients with X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia show intractable
seizures, especially clonic convulsions or myoclonus from the first day of life, 
but neither infantile spasms nor hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalograms so far. 
Brain magnetic resonance imaging shows anterior pachygyria and posterior agyria
with a mildly thick cortex, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and dysplastic basal
ganglia. ARX, a paired-class homeobox gene with four polyalanine sequences, is a 
responsible gene for X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia. The brain of
Arx knockout mice shows aberrant tangential migration and differentiation of
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons. In human X-linked lissencephaly
with abnormal genitalia, a neuropathologic study has suggested a loss of
interneurons. Meanwhile, polyalanine expansion of ARX causes symptomatic or
nonsymptomatic West's syndrome and nonsyndromic mental retardation. The striking 
epileptogenicity of X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia and West's
syndrome associated with ARX mutations i s considered to be caused by a disorder 
of interneurons involving a tangentialmigration disorder. We propose
"interneuronopathy" as a term for this.

and Psychiatry, University of Pisa and Research Institute, Stella Maris

Several malformation syndromes with abnormal cortical development have been
recognized. Specific causative gene defects and characteristic electroclinical
patterns have been identified for some. X-linked periventricular nodular
heterotopia is mainly seen in female patients and is often associated with focal 
epilepsy. FLN1 mutations have been reported in all familial cases and in about
25% of sporadic patients. A rare recessive form of periventricular nodular
heterotopia owing to ARGEF2 gene mutations has also been reported in children
with microcephaly, severe delay, and early-onset seizures.
Lissencephaly-pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia represent a
malformative spectrum resulting from mutations of either the LIS1 or the DCX
(XLIS) gene. LIS1 mutations cause a more severe malformation posteriorly. Most
children have severe developmental delay and infantile spasms, but milder
phenotypes are on record, including posterior subcortical band heterotopia owing 
to mosaic mutations of LIS1. DCX mutations usually cause anteriorly predominant
lissencephaly in male patients and subcortical band heterotopia in female
patients. Mutations of the coding region of DCX were found in all reported
pedigrees and in about 50% of sporadic female patients with subcortical band
heterotopia. Mutations of XLIS have also been found in male patients with
anterior subcortical band heterotopia and in female patients with normal brain
magnetic resonance imaging. The thickness of the band and the severity of
pachygyria correlate with the likelihood of developing severe epilepsy. Autosomal
recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia, accompanied by severe delay, 
hypotonia, and seizures, has been associated with mutations of the reelin (RELN) 
gene. X-linked lissencephaly with corpus callosum agenesis and ambiguous
genitalia in genotypic males is associated with mutations of the ARX gene.
Affected boys have severe delay and infantile spasms with suppression-burst
electroencephalograms. Early death is frequent. Carrier female patients can have 
isolated corpus callosum agenesis. Schizencephaly has a wide anatomoclinical
spectrum, including focal epilepsy in most patients. Familial occurrence is rare.
Initial reports of heterozygous mutations in the EMX2 gene have not been
confirmed. Among several syndromes featuring polymicrogyria, bilateral
perisylvian polymicrogyria shows genetic heterogeneity, including linkage to
chromosome Xq28 in some pedigrees, autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance in
others, and an association with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion in some patients.
About 65% of patients have severe epilepsy. Recessive bilateral frontoparietal
polymicrogyria has been associated with mutations of the GPR56 gene.

Neuronal migration in developmental disorders.

McManus MF(1), Golden JA.

Author information: 
(1)Neuroscience Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, USA.

Normal central nervous system development is dependent on extensive cell
migration. Cells born in the proliferative ventricular zone migrate radially
along specialized glial processes to their final locations. In contrast, most
inhibitory interneurons found in the adult mammalian cerebral cortex and some
other structures migrate along a nonradial pathway and on substrates only
recently defined. Defects in radial cell migration have been implicated in
several distinct human syndromes in which patients often present with epilepsy
and mental retardation and have characteristic cerebral abnormalities. The
identification of several genes responsible for human neural cell migration
defects has led to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular
interactions necessary for normal migration and the pathogenesis of these
disorders. The prototypic cell migration disorder in humans is type I
lissencephaly. Although type 1 lissencephaly is clearly a defect in radial cell
migration, recent data from two model systems (Lis1 and ARX mutant mice) indicate
that a defect in non-radial cell migration also exists. Thus, the result of a
LIS1 mutation appears to have broader implications than a radial cell migration
defect alone. Furthermore, it is likely that the observed defect in non-radial
cell migration contributes to the clinical phenotype observed in these patients. 
Herein we discuss the role of normal non-radial cell migration in cortical
development, as well as how perturbations in both radial and nonradial migration 
result in developmental anomalies.

CoI- and Co0-bipyridine complexes obtained by reduction of CoBr2bpy:
electrochemical behaviour and investigation of their reactions with aromatic

The electrochemical behaviour of CoBr(2)bpy (bpy=2,2'-bipyridine) catalyst
precursor in acetonitrile has been studied, revealing its possible reduction into
the corresponding Co(I) and Co(0) complexes. These low-valent cobalt species
appear to be stable on the time scale of cyclic voltammetry. In the presence of
aromatic halides, both complexes undergo oxidative addition, the latter Co(0)
species allowing the activation of poorly reactive aromatic chlorides. The
arylcobalt(III) and arylcobalt(II) obtained are reduced at the same potential as 
the original Co(II) and Co(I) complexes, respectively, resulting in the
observation of overall ECE mechanisms in both cases. The electrochemical study
shows that vinylic acetates competitively react with electrogenerated Co(0)
species, leading to a labile complex. Preparative scale electrolyses carried out 
from solutions containing aromatic halides (ArX), vinyl acetate (vinylOAc) and a 
catalytic amount of CoBr(2)bpy lead to a mixture of biaryl (Ar-Ar) and arene
(ArH) as long as the potential is set on the plateau of the Co(II) right arrow
over left arrow Co(I) reduction wave. The coupling product (Ar-vinyl) is formed
only if the electrolysis is performed on the plateau of the Co(I)/Co(0) reduction
wave. A mechanism is proposed for the overall cobalt-catalyzed coupling reaction 
between aromatic halides and allylic acetates.

BACKGROUND: Chronic periodontic-endodontic lesions are not uncommon in clinical
practice and their regenerative capacity has long been questioned. However, there
are no published studies investigating the application of guided tissue
regeneration techniques in combination with endodontic surgery using an induced
perio-endo defect model. This study evaluated the clinical, radiographic, and
histologic outcomes of three surgical procedures used to treat induced perio-endo
lesions.
METHODS: Pulpal necrosis was induced in foxhounds along with surgical removal of 
radicular buccal bone. After 4 weeks, chronic lesions were clinically and
radiographically assessed. Treatment surgery consisted of apicoectomy, root canal
instrumentation, and retrofilling with mineral trioxide aggregate. Teeth were
then assigned to one of the following treatment groups: open flap debridement
only (OFD), OFD with bioabsorbable porcine-derived collagen membrane (BG), or OFD
with BG and anorganic bovine bone matrix (BO/BG). Clinical parameters and
standardized radiographs were assessed at defect creation; treatment surgery; and
at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. Animals were sacrificed at 6 months and specimens
prepared for histometric analysis.
RESULTS: Clinical and radiographic conditions improved during the study period.
Mean epithelial attachment was similar between all groups. Mean connective tissue
attachment for groups OFD, BG, and BO/BG was 3.79 mm, 2.63 mm, and 1.75 mm,
respectively, and mean radicular bone height was 2.16 mm, 3.24 mm, and 3.45 mm,
respectively. Statistically significant increases in the amount of new cementum
were observed in groups BG and BO/BG when compared with OFD (P <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of combined induced perio-endo lesions using bioabsorbable
collagen membranes alone or in combination with anorganic bovine bone matrix
resulted in increased amounts of bone, periodontal ligament, and significant
increases in the amount of new cementum when compared to open flap debridement in
a canine model.

BACKGROUND: X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is the leading cause of mental
retardation in males. Mutations in the ARX gene in Xp22.1 have been found in
numerous families with both nonsyndromic and syndromic XLMR. The most frequent
mutation in this gene is a 24 bp duplication in exon 2. Based on this fact, a
panel of XLMR families linked to Xp22 was tested for this particular ARX
mutation.
METHODS: Genomic DNA from XLMR families linked to Xp22.1 was amplified for exon 2
in ARX using a Cy5 labeled primer pair. The resulting amplicons were sized using 
the ALFexpress automated sequencer.
RESULTS: A panel of 11 families with X-linked mental retardation was screened for
the ARX 24dup mutation. Four nonsyndromic XLMR families - MRX29, MRX32, MRX33 and
MRX38 - were found to have this particular gene mutation.
CONCLUSION: We have identified 4 additional XLMR families with the ARX dup24
mutation from a panel of 11 XLMR families linked to Xp22.1. This finding makes
the ARX dup24 mutation the most common mutation in nonsyndromic XLMR families
linked to Xp22.1. As this mutation can be readily tested for using an automated
sequencer, screening should be considered for any male with nonsyndromic MR of
unknown etiology.

Isolation and antifungal activity of kakuol, a propiophenone derivative from
Asarum sieboldii rhizome.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Bioscience and Technology, College of Life and Environmental
Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-713, Korea.

An antifungal substance active against Colletotrichum orbiculare (Berk & Mont)
Arx was isolated from the methanol extracts of Asarum sieboldii (Miq) Maek
rhizomes. High-resolution MS, NMR and UV spectral data confirmed that the
antifungal substance is kakuol, 2-hydroxy-4,5-methylenedioxypropiophenone.
Colletotrichum orbiculare was most sensitive to kakuol, with MIC of 10 microg
ml(-1). Kakuol also completely inhibited the mycelial growth of Botrytis cinerea 
Pers ex Fr and Cladosporium cucumerinum Ellis & Arthur at 50 microg ml(-1) and 30
microg ml(-1), respectively. However, no antimicrobial activity was found against
yeast and bacteria even at 100 microg ml(-1). Kakuol exhibited a protective
activity against the development of anthracnose disease on cucumber plants. The
control efficacy of kakuol against the anthracnose disease was in general
somewhat less than that of the commercial fungicide chlorothalonil. This is the
first report to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of kakuol
against C. orbiculare infection.

A parametric feature extraction and classification strategy for brain-computer
interfacing.

Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland. david.burke@ucd.ie

Parametric modeling strategies are explored in conjunction with linear
discriminant analysis for use in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based
brain-computer interface (BCI). A left/right self-paced typing exercise is
analyzed by extending the usual autoregressive (AR) model for EEG feature
extraction with an AR with exogenous input (ARX) model for combined filtering and
feature extraction. The ensemble averaged Bereitschafts potential (an event
related potential preceding the onset of movement) forms the exogenous signal
input to the ARX model. Based on trials with six subjects, the ARX case of
modeling both the signal and noise was found to be considerably more effective
than modeling the noise alone (common in BCI systems) with the AR method yielding
a classification accuracy of 52.8+/-4.8% and the ARX method an accuracy of
79.1+/-3.9 % across subjects. The results suggest a role for ARX-based feature
extraction in BCIs based on evoked and event-related potentials.

FVEPs in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease: waveforms and interaction with the periodic
EEG pattern assessed by single sweep analysis.

Celoria 11, 20133 Milan, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To characterise flash visual evoked potentials (FVEPs) in 20 patients 
with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), and assess the relationships between
spontaneous EEG patterns and the responses to individual stimuli.
METHODS: We analysed the shape and time course of periodic sharp wave complexes
(PSWCs) and responses to 1 Hz flashes. In nine patients, we applied an algorithm 
based on an autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX) to estimate responses
to individual random flashes and their interaction with PSWCs.
RESULTS: The FVEPs included P1 and N1 components in all patients, and the P2 peak
in 18. Eight patients showed giant FVEPs (N1-P2>60 V), all of whom had an MM
polymorphism in codon 129 of the prion protein gene; in seven cases, the presence
of giant FVEPs correlated with a prominent and almost continuous periodic EEG
pattern. Giant N1-P2 abnormally spread on the anterior scalp regions, and had a
different waveform distribution from that of the PSWCs. In five patients with a
normal or slightly enlarged average N1-P2 amplitude, single sweep (ARX) analysis 
revealed a period of relative refractoriness following individual PSWCs. In four 
patients with 'giant' FVEPs, the individual responses occurred regardless of the 
interval between the stimulus and previous PSWC, but their amplitude had an
inverse relationship with the interval length.
CONCLUSIONS: Giant responses to flash stimuli are a common finding in CJD
patients (40% of our cases). Single sweep ARX analysis showed that PSWCs were
followed by a period of partial refractoriness, which prevented most of the
individual responses to flashes, but not giant FVEPs. The association between
prominent spontaneous paroxysms and giant FVEPs suggests that both are due to a
common hyperexcitable change favouring neuronal synchronisation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our data contribute to clarifying the debated problem of the
occurrence of giant FVEPs in CJD and their relationships with the spontaneous
periodic EEG pattern.

Regulation of chemosensory and GABAergic motor neuron development by the C.
elegans Aristaless/Arx homolog alr-1.

Melkman T(1), Sengupta P.

Author information:

02454, USA.

Mutations in the highly conserved Aristaless-related homeodomain protein ARX have
been shown to underlie multiple forms of X-linked mental retardation. Arx
knockout mice exhibit thinner cerebral cortices because of decreased neural
precursor proliferation, and also exhibit defects in the differentiation and
migration of GABAergic interneurons. However, the role of ARX in the observed
behavioral and developmental abnormalities is unclear. The regulatory functions
of individual homeodomain proteins and the networks in which they act are
frequently highly conserved across species, although these networks may be
deployed in different developmental contexts. In Drosophila, aristaless mutants
exhibit defects in the development of terminal appendages, and Aristaless has
been shown to function with the LIM-homeodomain protein LIM1 to regulate leg
development. Here, we describe the role of the Aristaless/Arx homolog alr-1 in C.
elegans. We show that alr-1 acts in a pathway with the LIM1 ortholog lin-11 to
regulate the development of a subset of chemosensory neurons. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the differentiation of a GABAergic motoneuron subtype is
affected in alr-1 mutants, suggesting parallels with ARX functions in
vertebrates. Investigating ALR-1 functions in C. elegans may yield insights into 
the role of this important protein in neuronal development and the etiology of
mental retardation.

Recombineered Xenopus tropicalis BAC expresses a GFP reporter under the control
of Arx transcriptional regulatory elements in transgenic Xenopus laevis embryos.

Kelly LE(1), Davy BE, Berbari NF, Robinson ML, El-Hodiri HM.

(1)Center for Molecular and Human Genetics, Columbus Children's Research
Institute, Columbus, Ohio 43205, USA.

The aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) gene is expressed in a dynamic pattern in
the developing vertebrate forebrain. We identified a bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) containing the Xenopus tropicalis Arx gene and replaced a
portion of the first coding exon with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)
expression cassette by homologous recombination in bacteria (recombineering).
Transgenic X. laevis embryos obtained by microinjecting the modified BAC
expressed GFP in the developing forebrain in a pattern identical to that of the
endogenous Arx gene. Thus, this BAC contains transcriptional regulatory elements 
necessary for regulating proper expression in transgenic frogs. This work
demonstrates that transgenesis using recombineered BACs is a viable technique in 
Xenopus.

Republic of China.

A series of 2-oxocycloalkylsulfonylureas (2) have been synthesized in a six-step,
three-pot reaction sequence from readily available cyclododecanone,
cycloheptanone, and cyclohexanone. Their structures were confirmed by IR, 1H NMR,
and elemental analysis. The bioassay indicated that some of them possess certain 
fungicidal activity against Gibberella zeae Petch. In general, compounds
containing a 12-membered ring (2A) are more active than those containing a 6- or 
7-membered ring (2B, 2C). In the series 2A, the compounds in which R is a
disubstituted phenyl or pyrimidyl showed better activity than those in which R is
a monosubstituted phenyl or pyrimidyl, and aryl-substituted compounds have
somewhat higher activity than those substituted by pyrimidyl. The further
bioassay showed that the representative of 2A, 2A15, has good fungicidal
activities against not only G. zeae Petch but also Botrytis cinerea Pers,
Colletotrichum orbiculare Arx, Pythium aphanidermatum Fitzp, Fusarium oxysporum
Schl. f. sp. Vasinfectum, etc.

Efficacy of A-line AEP Monitor as a tool for predicting acceptable tracheal
intubation conditions during sevoflurane anaesthesia.

alpiger@dadlnet.dk

BACKGROUND: It is essential for the clinical anaesthetist to know whether
patients are sufficiently anaesthetized to tolerate direct laryngoscopy and
endotracheal intubation. Because of the lack of an accurate objective method to
determine the level of general anaesthesia, under- or overdosing of anaesthetics 
may occur. Auditory evoked potential (AEP) is one of several physiological
parameters under investigation. We aimed to determine the clinically required
depth of anaesthesia, measured by the A-line AEP Monitor and expressed as A-Line 
ARX Index (AAI) for 90% probability of acceptable conditions for endotracheal
intubation.
METHODS: We studied 108 patients anaesthetized by mask with increasing
concentration of sevoflurane in 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide. Fentanyl 1.5
microg kg(-1) and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg were administered intravenously
immediately before starting induction of anaesthesia. The monitor was programmed 
to give an alarm at AAI 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 according to randomization. When the
alarm sounded, the end-expiratory sevoflurane concentration was registered and
endotracheal intubation was attempted. Intubation conditions were assessed by an 
observer blinded to the AAI.
RESULTS: At AAI 10 we found acceptable conditions in 91% (confidence interval [CI
72-99%]) of patients. The prediction probability value P(K) of AAI was 0.69 (CI
0.59-0.79) and the P(K) of end-expiratory sevoflurane concentration was 0.93 (CI 
0.87-0.99). ED(90) (the AAI with a 90% probability of acceptable intubation
conditions) was calculated as 8.5 (CI 0-17.5).
CONCLUSIONS: AAI indicates the depth of anaesthesia necessary for acceptable
endotracheal intubation conditions. Under the conditions of the present study,
end-expiratory sevoflurane concentration was a better predictor and may turn out 
to be more useful in the clinical setting.

Mutations in the ARX gene can result in many different phenotypes, including
phenotypes associated with severe brain malformations and less severe phenotypes 
associated with syndromic or non-syndromic forms of XLMR. There seems to be a
consistent genotype-phenotype correlation and both interfamilial and
intrafamilial variability of expression of some of the mutations, particularly
the common 428-451dup(24 bp) mutation. Familiarity with the phenotypic spectrum
of ARX mutations is helpful in determining when to request ARX mutation analysis.

Siena, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, almost
exclusively affecting females and characterised by a wide spectrum of clinical
manifestations. Both the classic form and preserved speech variant of Rett
syndrome are due to mutations in the MECP2 gene. Several other variants of Rett
syndrome have been described. In 1985, Hanefeld described a variant with the
early appearance of convulsions. In this variant, the normal perinatal period is 
soon followed by the appearance of seizures, usually infantile spasms. We have
observed two patients with signs of Rett syndrome showing acquired microcephaly
and stereotypic midline hand movements. The disease started with generalised
convulsions and myoclonic fits at 1.5 months in the first patient and with spasms
at 10 days in the other, suggesting a diagnosis of the Hanefeld variant. In these
patients, MECP2 point mutations and gross rearrangements were excluded by
denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and real time quantitative PCR.
The ARX and CDKL5 genes have been associated with West syndrome (infantile
spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and mental retardation).
METHODS: Based on the clinical overlap between the Hanefeld variant and West
syndrome, we analysed ARX and CDKL5 in the two girls.
RESULTS: We found frameshift deletions in CDKL5 in both patients; one in exon 5
(c.163_166delGAAA) and the other in exon 18 (c.2635_2636delCT). CDKL5 was then
analysed in 19 classic Rett and 15 preserved speech variant patients, all MECP2
negative, but no mutations were found.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that CDKL5 is responsible for a rare variant of Rett
syndrome characterised by early development of convulsions, usually of the spasm 
type.

The vertebrate ortholog of Aristaless is regulated by Dlx genes in the developing
forebrain.

Author information: 
(1)Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology, Department of
Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California

The Dlx transcription factors have a central role in controlling the development 
of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in the forebrain. However, little
is known about how they control the properties of GABAergic neurons. One
candidate is the Aristaless (Arx) homeobox gene, which lies genetically
downstream of the fly Dlx gene (Distal-less, Dll). The expression of Arx in the
mouse forebrain includes Dlx-expressing territories, such us the ventral
thalamus, parts of the hypothalamus, and the ganglionic eminences and their
derivatives in the subpallial telencephalon, and is expressed, as with the Dlx
genes, in cortical GABAergic neurons. By using gain-of-function and
loss-of-function assays in mouse and chicken embryos, we show that the Dlx genes 
have a conserved role in regulating the expression of Arx in the forebrain of
vertebrates. Ectopic expression of Dlx genes with electroporation in brain slices
from mouse embryos and in the neural tube of chick embryos shows that Dlx genes
are sufficient to induce Arx ectopically. Moreover, we provide evidence that the 
Dlx genes exert a functionally relevant role in regulating Arx in vivo, as shown 
by the severe reduction in the expression of Arx in Dlx1/2 double-knockout mice. 
Therefore, our results suggest evolutionarily conserved functions of Dlx genes in
regulating Arx expression between Drosophila and vertebrates.

Foxa2 is required for the differentiation of pancreatic alpha-cells.

Lee CS(1), Sund NJ, Behr R, Herrera PL, Kaestner KH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics and Penn Diabetes Center, University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine, 415 Curie Boulevard, CRB 560 Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

The differentiation of insulin-producing beta-cells has been investigated in
great detail; however, little is known about the factors that delineate the
second-most abundant endocrine lineage, the glucagon-producing alpha-cell. Here
we utilize a novel YAC-based Foxa3Cre transgene to delete the winged helix
transcription factor Foxa2 (formerly HNF-3beta) in the pancreatic primordium
during midgestation. The resulting Foxa2(loxP/loxP); Foxa3Cre mice are severely
hypoglycemic and die within the first week of life. Mutant mice are
hypoglucagonemic secondary to a 90% reduction of glucagon expression. While the
number of mature glucagon-positive alpha-cells is dramatically reduced,
specification of alpha-cell progenitors is not affected by Foxa2 deficiency. By
marker gene analysis, we show that the expression of the alpha-cell transcription
factors Arx, Pax6, and Brn4 does not require Foxa2 in the transcriptional
hierarchy governing alpha-cell differentiation.

Arx homeobox gene is essential for development of mouse olfactory system.

The olfactory system provides an excellent model in which to study cell
proliferation, migration, differentiation, axon guidance, dendritic
morphogenesis, and synapse formation. We report here crucial roles of the Arx
homeobox gene in the developing olfactory system by analyzing its mutant
phenotypes. Arx protein was expressed strongly in the interneurons and weakly in 
the radial glia of the olfactory bulb, but in neither the olfactory sensory
neurons nor bulbar projection neurons. Arx-deficient mice showed severe
anatomical abnormalities in the developing olfactory system: (1) size reduction
of the olfactory bulb, (2) reduced proliferation and impaired entry into the
olfactory bulb of interneuron progenitors, (3) loss of tyrosine
hydroxylase-positive periglomerular cells, (4) disorganization of the layer
structure of the olfactory bulb, and (5) abnormal axonal termination of olfactory
sensory neurons in an unusual axon-tangled structure, the fibrocellular mass.
Thus, Arx is required for not only the proper developmental processes of
Arx-expressing interneurons, but also the establishment of functional olfactory
neural circuitry by affecting Arx-non-expressing sensory neurons and projection
neurons. These findings suggest a likely role of Arx in regulating the expression
of putative instructive signals produced in the olfactory bulb for the proper
innervation of olfactory sensory axons.

Does the A-line ARX-lndex provide a reasonable assessment of anaesthetic depth in
dogs undergoing routine surgery?

The monitoring of anaesthetic depth is usually based on the subjective assessment
of the patient. An objective assessment of anaesthesia has only recently become
possible. The auditory-evoked response has predictable changes in response to
increasing doses of anaesthetic agents. Recent advances have brought about a
regression model with exogenous input of the auditory-evoked response, the A-line
ARX-Index (AAI Index). The AAI Index is a dimensionless number between 0 and 100.
This technology has been incorporated into the AEP (auditory-evoked potential)
monitor that is utilised to assess anaesthetic depth in humans. This study was
undertaken to determine if the AEP monitor was useful in dogs. Ten dogs were
enrolled in the study. After a full clinical and otoscopic examination, dogs were
premedicated with acetylpromazine and morphine. Anaesthesia was induced with
thiopentone and maintained with halothane. End-tidal carbon dioxide, temperature,
pulse oximetry, blood pressure and the electrocardiogram were monitored and
recorded every 5 minutes. Anaesthetic depth was assessed as either being adequate
or inadequate by the anaesthetist during surgery. An AEP monitor was attached to 
the patient and automatically collected AAI Index data. The anaesthetist was
blinded to the AEP monitor. Following the completion of the surgical procedure,
the patient was allowed to wake up with the AEP monitor attached. The AAI Index
was analysed to compare adequate with inadequate anaesthesia during the period of
surgery and awake with sleep data during recovery. All AAI Index values
associated with inadequate anaesthesia were greater than 31 while adequate values
were less than 35. The difference between the groups was statistically
significant and the power was 0.97. Statistically, the awake and sleep values
were significantly different with a power of 0.99. From this study it can be
concluded that the AAI Index shows good prospect for the evaluation of
anaesthetic depth in dogs undergoing surgery. A larger study is needed to confirm
these results.

Localization of human X chromosomal mental retardation (MRX) genes in chicken and
comparison with the chicken genome sequence data.

In an ongoing study human X chromosomal mental retardation genes (MRX) were
mapped in the chicken genome. Up to now the homologs of 13 genes were localized
by FISH techniques. Four genes from HSAXp (TM4SF2, RSK2/RPS6KA3, NLGN4, ARX) map 
to GGA1q13-->q31, and seven genes from HSAXq (OPHN1, AGTR2, ARHGEF6, PAK3,
FACL4/ACS4, FMR2, ATRX) to GGA4p. The gene-rich region of HSAXq28 proved to be
much less conserved. GDI1 localized to GGA1pter and SLC6A8 to a mid-sized
microchromosome. The order of the genes was determined from the newly available
genome sequence data from chicken, which reveals exact colinearity between the
genes in HSAXp and GGA1q13-->q31, but completely scrambled gene order between the
genes with common synteny from HSAXq and GGA4p. This result supports the
hypothesis that the human X chromosome is a real ancient autosomal linkage group.

Monoligated palladium species as catalysts in cross-coupling reactions.

Christmann U(1), Vilar R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.

Palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions are attractive organometallic
transformations for the generation of C--C, C--N, C--O, and C--S bonds. Despite
being widely employed in small-scale syntheses, cross-coupling reactions have not
found important industrial applications because until recently, only reactive
aryl bromides and iodides could be used as substrates. These substrates are
generally more expensive and less widely available than their chloride
counterparts. Over the past few years, new catalytic systems with the ability to 
activate unreactive and sterically hindered aryl chlorides have been developed.
The new catalysts are based on palladium complexes that contain electron-rich and
bulky phosphine or carbene ligands. The enhanced reactivity observed with these
new systems has been attributed to the formation of unsaturated and reactive
[PdL] species which can readily undergo oxidative addition reactions with ArX to 
yield [Pd(Ar)X(L)].

Xenopus aristaless-related homeobox (xARX) gene product functions as both a
transcriptional activator and repressor in forebrain development.

Institute, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.

Mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene have been found in
patients with a variety of X-linked mental retardation syndromes with forebrain
abnormalities, including lissencephaly. Arx is expressed in the developing mouse,
Xenopus, and zebrafish forebrain. We have used whole-mount in situ hybridization,
overexpression, and loss-of-function studies to investigate the involvement of
xArx in Xenopus brain development. We verified that xArx is expressed in the
prospective diencephalon, as the forebrain is patterned and specified during
neural plate stages. Expression spreads into the ventral and medial telencephalon
as development proceeds through neural tube and tadpole stages. Overexpression of
xArx resulted in morphological abnormalities in forebrain development, including 
loss of rostral midline structures, syn- or anophthalmia, dorsal displacement of 
the nasal organ, and ventral neural tube hyperplasia. Additionally, there is a
delay in expression of many molecular markers of brain and retinal development.
However, expression of some markers, dlx5 and wnt8b, was enhanced in
xArx-injected embryos. Loss-of-function experiments indicated that xArx was
necessary for normal forebrain development. Expansion of wnt8b expression
depended on xArx function as a transcriptional repressor, whereas ectopic
expression of dlx5, accompanied by development of ectopic otic structures,
depended on function of Arx as a transcriptional activator. These results suggest
that Arx acts as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator in brain development.

Recent rate data for very fast cleaving of aryl chloride and bromide anion
radicals may be accommodated satisfactorily within rate constant versus ArX/ArX*-
standard potential existing correlations provided the standard potential is
determined experimentally. Cyclic voltammetry is used for this purpose, taking
careful account of the electron transfer/fragmentation reaction mixed character
of the kinetics. The ensuing activation/driving force relationships allow the
determination of the intrinsic barriers, the magnitude of which are discussed in 
the framework of a new Morse curve model that includes and emphasizes the role of
bond bending.

A polyalanine tract expansion in Arx forms intranuclear inclusions and results in
increased cell death.

(1)Neuroscience Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,
Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

A growing number of human disorders have been associated with expansions of a
tract of a single amino acid. Recently, polyalanine (polyA) tract expansions in
the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) protein have been identified in a subset of
patients with infantile spasms and mental retardation. How alanine expansions in 
ARX, or any other transcription factor, cause disease have not been determined.
We generated a series of polyA expansions in Arx and expressed these in cell
culture and brain slices. Transfection of these constructs results in nuclear
protein aggregation, filamentous nuclear inclusions, and an increase in cell
death. These inclusions are ubiquitinated and recruit Hsp70. Coexpressing Hsp70
decreases the percentage of cells with nuclear inclusions. Finally, we show that 
expressing mutant Arx in mouse brains results in neuronal nuclear inclusion
formation. Our data suggest expansions in one of the ARX polyA tracts results in 
nuclear protein aggregation and an increase in cell death; likely underlying the 
pathogenesis of the associated infantile spasms and mental retardation.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused, in most
classic cases, by mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene
(MECP2). A large degree of phenotypic variation has been observed in patients
with RTT, both those with and without MECP2 mutations. We describe a family
consisting of a proband with a phenotype that showed considerable overlap with
that of RTT, her identical twin sister with autistic disorder and
mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a brother with profound
intellectual disability and seizures. No pathogenic MECP2 mutations were found in
this family, and the Xq28 region that contains the MECP2 gene was not shared by
the affected siblings. Three other candidate regions were identified by
microsatellite mapping, including 10.3 Mb at Xp22.31-pter between Xpter and
DXS1135, 19.7 Mb at Xp22.12-p22.11 between DXS1135 and DXS1214, and 16.4 Mb at
Xq21.33 between DXS1196 and DXS1191. The ARX and CDKL5 genes, both of which are
located within the Xp22 region, were sequenced in the affected family members,
and a deletion of nucleotide 183 of the coding sequence (c.183delT) was
identified in CDKL5 in the affected family members. In a screen of 44 RTT cases, 
a single splice-site mutation, IVS13-1G-->A, was identified in a girl with a
severe phenotype overlapping RTT. In the mouse brain, Cdkl5 expression
overlaps--but is not identical to--that of Mecp2, and its expression is
unaffected by the loss of Mecp2. These findings confirm CDKL5 as another locus
associated with epilepsy and X-linked mental retardation. These results also
suggest that mutations in CDKL5 can lead to a clinical phenotype that overlaps
RTT. However, it remains to be determined whether CDKL5 mutations are more
prevalent in specific clinical subgroups of RTT or in other clinical
presentations.

The most significant progresses in the understanding of human brain functions
have been possible due to the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), which when used in combination with other standard neuroimaging
techniques (i.e., EEG) provides researchers with a potential tool to elucidate
many biophysical principles, established previously by animal comparative
studies. However, to date, most of the methods proposed in the literature seeking
fMRI signs have been limited to the use of a top-down data analysis approach,
thus ignoring a pool of physiological facts. In spite of the important
contributions achieved by applying these methods to actual data, there is a
disproportionate gap between theoretical models and data-analysis strategies
while trying to focus on several new prospects, like for example fMRI/EEG data
fusion, causality/connectivity patterns, and nonlinear BOLD signal dynamics. In
this paper, we propose a new approach which will allow many of the abovementioned
hot topics to be addressed in the near future with an underlying interpretability
based on bottom-up modeling. In particular, the theta-MAP presented in the paper 
to test brain activation corresponds very well with the standardized t test of
the SPM99 toolbox. Additionally, a new Impulse Response Function (IRF) has been
formulated, directly related to the well-established concept of the hemodynamics 
response function (HRF). The model uses not only the information contained in the
signal but also that in the structure of the background noise to simultaneously
estimate the IRF and the autocorrelation function (ACF) by using an
autoregressive (AR) model with a filtered Poisson process driving the dynamics.
The short-range contributions of voxels within the near-neighborhood are also
included, and the potential drift was characterized by a polynomial series. Since
our model originated from an immediate extension of the hemodynamics approach
[Friston, K.J., Mechelli, A., Turner, R., Price C.J. (2000a). Nonlinear responses
in fMRI: the balloon model, volterra kernels, and other hemodynamics. NeuroImage 
12, 466-477.], a natural interpretability of the results is feasible.

Mouse orthologue of ARX, a gene mutated in several X-linked forms of mental

Mutations in the human ARX gene show unusually heterogeneous clinical
presentations, including syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation, myoclonic
epilepsy with spasticity, and lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, that are
believed to arise from an impairment of the embryonic mechanisms building the
anterior central nervous system structures. Here, we show that the murine
ortholog Arx has a highly dynamic expression pattern during both early shaping of
the forebrain vesicle and later major events of neural migrations and cell-type
specification. Early on, the Arx gene is specifically activated in anterior
forebrain anlage. Afterward, Arx expression is confined to the telencephalic
vesicles and is enhanced during differentiation of the subpallial structures of
the ganglionic eminences, overlapping with Dlx2, Dlx5, and Gad1 transcriptional
domains. Tangentially migrating neurons reaching the cortical plate are also
Arx-positive at all embryonic stages analyzed. RNA-protein colabeling staining
shows that Arx expression is maintained in the mature cortical interneurons,
suggesting its involvement in the different functions of the gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)ergic neurons settled into the adult cerebral cortex. Finally, Arx
expression is detected in the anterior subventricular layer of the adult brain,
where neural stem cells have been shown to be located. Of interest, Arx
expression is highly up-regulated during in vitro differentiation of pure neural 
stem cell cultures retrieved from adult brain. All together, these findings
suggest Arx as a gene involved in the commitment of proliferating neuroblasts
into a GABAergic neuronal fate. In conclusion, our mouse Arx expression data
provide important further insights into the puzzling complexity of the human ARX 
mutation pleiotropy.

Monogenic X-linked mental retardation: is it as frequent as currently estimated? 
The paradox of the ARX (Aristaless X) mutations.

Mental retardation affects 30 to 50% more males than females, and X-linked mental
retardation (XLMR) is thought to account for the major part of this sex bias.
Nonsyndromic XLMR is very heterogeneous, with more than 15 genes identified to
date, each of them accounting for a very small proportion of nonsyndromic
families. The Aristaless X (ARX) gene is an exception since it was found mutated 
in 11 of 136 such families, with a highly recurrent mutation (dup24) leading to
an expansion of a polyalanine tract in the protein. The rather high frequency of 
dup24 reported in families with clear X-linked MR (6.6%) contrasts with the very 
low prevalence of this mutation observed in sporadic male MR (0.13%). We conclude
that monogenic XLMR has much lower prevalence in male MR (< 10%) than the 23%
that would be required to account for a 30% male excess of mental retardation.

Is the ARX index a more sensitive indicator of anesthetic depth than the
bispectral index during sevoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia?

BACKGROUND: During general anesthesia, hypnotic components have been monitored
with electroencephalogram. The bispectral index is derived from a cortical
electroencephalogram, but the A-line ARX index is the electroencephalographic
response to auditory stimuli. The purpose of this study was to compare the
changes of the A-line ARX index and the bispectral index during sevoflurane -
nitrous oxide anesthesia.
METHODS: One hundred females aged 30-60 years, and scheduled for partial
mastectomy, were divided into two groups. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane
5% and nitrous oxide in oxygen for 3 min. A laryngeal mask airway was inserted,
and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1-2% and nitrous oxide in oxygen. 
During surgery, the sevoflurane end-tidal concentration was kept at 0.5%, 1%, or 
2% for 5 min before each measurement. Blood pressure, heart rate, and the A-line 
ARX index (n = 50), and the bispectral index (n = 50) were measured.
RESULTS: Blood pressure and heart rate increased following laryngeal mask airway 
insertion and blood pressure decreased at 2% sevoflurane in both groups
similarly. The A-line ARX index, but not the bispectral index, increased
significantly by laryngeal mask airway insertion and skin incision. The A-line
ARX index decreased at 2% sevoflurane compared with 0.5%, while the bispectral
index remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: During sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, the A-line ARX index
might be a more sensitive indicator of anesthetic depth than the bispectral
index.

X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) is a rare disorder caused
by mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene. We report on the
clinical data of a boy with a 1-bp deletion (790 delC) resulting in a frame shift
in the ARX gene and prolonged survival until age 18 months. Similar to other
patients, the boy showed postnatal microcephaly, hypothalamic dysfunction,
intractable neonatal seizures, and chronic diarrhoea. In addition, he suffered
from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and renal phosphate wasting became
apparent from age 5 months, both of which have not been described previously in
XLAG. This allows us to speculate that the phenotype of XLAG is more complex than
hitherto known and may include renal phosphate wasting which might not have been 
observed in other patients due to early death.

Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are associated with a
broad spectrum of disorders including X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal
genitalia (XLAG) and absent corpus callosum. Here, we describe a family with two 
male infants suffering from agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), intractable
epilepsy, and abnormal genitalia. The phenotype of both affected patients
differed in severity of the cerebral malformation with one showing no obvious
evidence for lissencephaly. Both infants lacked any psychomotor development and
died at the age of 17 weeks and 18 months, respectively. Genetic analysis of the 
ARX gene revealed a novel frameshift mutation in exon 4 (nt1419_1420insAC)
leading to a shortened protein lacking the aristaless domain. In summary,
analysis of the ARX gene should not only be considered in male patients with
typical features of XLAG but also in those presenting with early onset epilepsy, 
ACC, and abnormal genitalia without obvious neuroradiological features of
lissencephaly.

Efficacy of the A-line AEP monitor as a tool for predicting successful insertion 
of a laryngeal mask during sevoflurane anesthesia.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesiology, Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.
alpiger@dadlnet.dk

BACKGROUND: The use of clinical signs for assessing depth of anesthesia is
unreliable during periods with little noxious stimulation. A patient may appear
adequately anesthetized at one moment at a given level of stimulation, but may
later, when facing other more intense stimuli, show signs of insufficient
anesthesia. In order to prevent under- or overdosing of anesthetics, an
anesthesia depth monitor that is able to predict responses to noxious stimulation
would therefore be useful. Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) is one of several
physiological parameters under investigation. The method has been improved by
rapid extraction and conversion of the AEP curve into an index (A-Line ARX Index 
= AAI). We aimed to determine the clinically required depth of anesthesia,
measured by the A-line AEP Monitor, for at least 90% probability of acceptable
insertion conditions for a laryngeal mask airway (LMA).
METHODS: We studied 112 patients anesthetized by mask with increasing
concentration of sevoflurane in oxygen. The monitor was programmed to give an
alarm at AAI between 15 and 40 according to randomization. When the alarm
sounded, the end-expiratory sevoflurane concentration was recorded and the LMA
inserted. Insertion conditions were assessed by an observer blinded to the AAI.
RESULTS: The ED(95) and prediction probability (P(K)) for AAI were 14.5 (CI
7.4-21.6) and 0.76 (0.66-0.86), respectively, while the ED(95) and P(K) for
expiratory sevoflurane concentration were 4.36% (CI 3.73-4.98) and 0.95
(0.91-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: AAI indicates the level of depth of anesthesia necessary for
acceptable laryngeal mask insertion conditions. End-expiratory sevoflurane
concentration was the better predictor.

BACKGROUND: Acute rejection (aRx) has a major impact on the long-term outcome of 
renal allografts, and its diagnosis is contingent on the invasive procedure of
allograft biopsy. New immunosuppressive protocols have reduced the incidence but 
have not abolished this problem. Moreover, aRx is now more frequently seen
several weeks after transplantation in outpatients. A noninvasive diagnostic test
for predicting aRx could improve the management and outcome. The recently
described measurement of urinary mRNA expression offers a new noninvasive
approach.
METHODS: In this study, the authors monitored the urinary mRNA expression (221
specimens from 26 patients) of various immune molecules by real-time
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for up to 3 months after kidney
transplantation. Most of the patients received anti-interleukin (IL)-2 receptor
monoclonal antibody induction and tacrolimus-based maintenance immunosuppression,
which resulted in a low incidence of aRx. To verify the "rejection" markers, an
additional nine samples of patients with aRx were analyzed.
RESULTS: Granulysin mRNA increase (vs. 95% confidence interval of 159 urine
samples from nonrejecting patients) was detected during 11 of 14 aRx episodes,
and follow-up studies showed its predictive value for delayed aRx episodes, even 
weeks before enhanced serum creatinine was observed. Granulysin induction was
associated with enhanced regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and
secreted (RANTES) mRNA expression in 8 of 11 samples. Other cytotoxic effector
molecules (granzyme B, perforin, FasL), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
RANTES, IL-2, IL-10, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta), CD3, and
CCR1 showed less specificity and sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data illustrate that the noninvasive kinetic mRNA
expression measurement of defined markers in urinary cells of renal allograft
recipients allows the early noninvasive detection of ongoing aRx.

Spectral entropy as an electroencephalographic measure of anesthetic drug effect:
a comparison with bispectral index and processed midlatency auditory evoked
response.

Vanluchene AL(1), Vereecke H, Thas O, Mortier EP, Shafer SL, Struys MM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesia, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: The authors compared the behavior of two calculations of
electroencephalographic spectral entropy, state entropy (SE) and response entropy
(RE), with the A-Line ARX Index (AAI) and the Bispectral Index (BIS) and as
measures of anesthetic drug effect. They compared the measures for baseline
variability, burst suppression, and prediction probability. They also developed
pharmacodynamic models relating SE, RE, AAI, and BIS to the calculated propofol
effect-site concentration (Ceprop).
METHODS: With institutional review board approval, the authors studied 10
patients. All patients received 50 mg/min propofol until either burst suppression
greater than 80% or mean arterial pressure less than 50 mmHg was observed. SE,
RE, AAI, and BIS were continuously recorded. Ceprop was calculated from the
propofol infusion profile. Baseline variability, prediction of burst suppression,
prediction probability, and Spearman rank correlation were calculated for SE, RE,
AAI, and BIS. The relations between Ceprop and the electroencephalographic
measures of drug effect were estimated using nonlinear mixed effect modeling.
RESULTS: Baseline variability was lowest when using SE and RE. Burst suppression 
was most accurately detected by spectral entropy. Prediction probability and
individualized Spearman rank correlation were highest for BIS and lowest for SE. 
Nonlinear mixed effect modeling generated reasonable models relating all four
measures to Ceprop.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BIS and AAI, both SE and RE seem to be useful
electroencephalographic measures of anesthetic drug effect, with low baseline
variability and accurate burst suppression prediction. The ability of the
measures to predict Ceprop was best for BIS.

Three families with X-linked mental retardation caused by a 24 base-pair
duplication in ARX[428-451dup(24 bp)] are reported. The clinical features in
these and six other published families are reviewed. In general, the clinical
picture is variable. Mental retardation ranges from mild to severe. Infantile
spasms (West syndrome) occurred in 12.5% and other less severe forms of seizures 
in 37.5%. Characteristic dystonic movements of the hands were seen in 63% and
dysarthria in 54%. The focal dystonia, in association with mental retardation,
may prove to be diagnostic of this mutation.

syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of mental retardation. It seems that the less
severe forms are due to polyalanine expansions and missense mutations in the
gene. We screened 682 developmentally retarded males for polyalanine expansions
in ARX in order to examine the contribution of ARX mutations to the causes of
developmental retardation. We also reinvestigated 11 putative MRX and three MR
families where no cause of mental retardation had been found, by mutational
analysis of ARX. Mutational analysis was also performed in 11 probands with
autism from families with two or more affected males. We find that previously
described polyalanine expansions of ARX are not a common cause of mental
retardation.

The A-line ARX index may be a more sensitive detector of arousal than the
bispectral index during propofol-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia: a preliminary
investigation.

Nishiyama T(1), Hanaoka K.

PURPOSE: To compare changes in the A-line ARX index (AAI) by the Alaris AEP
monitor(TM) with those of the bispectral index (BIS) during
propofol-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia.
METHODS: Eighty female patients undergoing partial mastectomy were randomly
allocated to AAI or BIS (40 per group). Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg
x kg(-1) and fentanyl 3 micro g x kg(-1) during the inhalation of oxygen. A
laryngeal mask airway (LMA) #3 was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with
propofol 4 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1), fentanyl 1 micro g x kg(-1) given at the start
of surgery, and nitrous oxide 4 L x min(-1) in oxygen 2 L x min(-1). Blood
pressure, heart rate, and AAI or BIS were monitored, including recovery time of
the index after disturbance by electrocautery.
RESULTS: The AAI but not the BIS increased significantly with LMA insertion and
skin incision, while blood pressure and heart rate did not change. The BIS
decreased from 87 +/- 7 to 30-60 while the AAI decreased from 75 +/- 8 to 10-25
during anesthesia. The increase of the AAI was larger than that of the BIS at
recovery from anesthesia. The variation of the index was smaller in the AAI than 
in the BIS. Recovery time of the index after electrocautery was significantly
longer in the BIS group (21 +/- 9 sec) than that in the AAI group (5 +/- 3 sec).
CONCLUSIONS: During propofol-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia, the AAI responded
to LMA insertion or surgical incision, but not the BIS, and the AAI had smaller
variations. The AAI recovered faster from the disturbance by electrocautery than 
the BIS. Thus, the AAI may be a more sensitive and useful detector of arousal
than the BIS.

The WASP-Arp2/3 pathway: genetic insights.

Vartiainen MK(1), Machesky LM.

Author information:

Laboratories, Transcription Laboratory, London, WC2A 3PX, UK.

Arp2/3 complex nucleates the formation of dendritic actin filament arrays, which 
are especially prominent at the leading edges of motile cells. Recent genetic and
other loss-of-function studies have highlighted the importance of the Arp2/3
complex for normal cell functions, and especially for cell motility. WASP/Scar
family proteins regulate the activity of the Arp2/3 complex, and also link it to 
several signaling pathways. Recent studies suggest that Scar is a more important 
regulator of Arp2/3 activity in actin-dependent morphological processes than
WASP, which may have a more restricted role in specialized cellular events. It
has also become clear that precise regulation of both Scar and WASP activity is
of the utmost importance for their physiological functions.

Faster dissociation: measured rates and computed effects on barriers in aryl
halide radical anions.

Takeda N(1), Poliakov PV, Cook AR, Miller JR.

Author information: 
(1)Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, USA.

Carbon-halogen bond dissociation rates for a series of aryl halide radical anions
(ArX-: X = Cl, Br) in NMP were measured at room temperature by pulse radiolysis
with 10-11 s time resolution. To obtain accurate dissociation rates, care was
taken to measure and correct for competing decay channels. The observed rates
correlated well with activation energies computed in the gas phase by density
functional (DFT) calculations. The rates did not correlate well with electron
affinities or dissociation energies obtained by the same computational methods,
although such correlations are reported in the literature and are expected on the
basis of simple models. The calculations also found that the transition state
structures had bent carbon-halogen bonds. Bending enables large reductions of the
activation energies by an electronic effect involving mixing of phi* and sigma*
states. This bending-induced mixing is computed to increase the dissociation
rates by a few orders of magnitude and is thus essential to understanding these
reactions.

Genetics of the epilepsies.

Gutierrez-Delicado E(1), Serratosa JM.

Author information: 
(1)Epilepsy Unit, Neurology Service, Fundación Jiménez Díaz and Department of
Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the most significant advances in the
field of genetics of the epilepsies during the past year, with emphasis on newly 
identified genes and functional studies leading to new insights into the
pathophysiology of epilepsy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCN2 have been
associated with the most common forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsies. A
mutation in the ATP1A2 sodium potassium ATPase pump gene has been described in a 
family in which familial hemiplegic migraine and benign familial infantile
convulsions partly co-segregate. The leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 gene
(LGI1) (also known as epitempin) was found to be responsible for
autosomal-dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in additional families. The
serine-threonine kinase 9 gene (STK9) was identified as the second gene
associated with X-linked infantile spasms. Mutations in the Aristaless-related
homeobox gene (ARX) have been recognized as a cause of X-linked infantile spasms 
and sporadic cryptogenic infantile spasms. A second gene underlying progressive
myoclonus epilepsy of Lafora, NHLRC1, was shown to code for a putative E3
ubiquitin ligase.
SUMMARY: Genes associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies remain within
the ion channel family. Mutations in non-ion channel genes are responsible for
autosomal-dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, a form of idiopathic focal
epilepsy, malformations of cortical development, and syndromes that combine
X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy. Most genetic epilepsies have a complex 
mode of inheritance, and genes identified so far account only for a minority of
families and sporadic cases. Functional studies are leading to a better
understanding of the mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability and seizures.

Neuroanatomical distribution of ARX in brain and its localisation in GABAergic
neurons.

Recent human genetics approaches identified the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX)
gene as the causative gene in X-linked infantile spasms, Partington syndrome, and
non-syndromic mental retardation as well as in forms of lissencephaly with
abnormal genitalia. The ARX predicted protein belongs to a large family of
homeoproteins and is characterised by a C-terminal Aristaless domain and an
octapeptide domain near the N-terminus. In order to learn more about ARX
function, we have studied in detail Arx expression in the central nervous system 
during mouse embryonic development as well as in the adult. During early stages
of development, Arx is expressed in a significant proportion of neurons in the
cortex, the striatum, the ganglionic eminences and also in the spinal cord. In
the adult, expression of Arx is still present and restricted to regions that are 
known to be rich in GABAergic neurons such as the amygdala and the olfactory
bulb. A possible role for Arx in this type of neurons is further reinforced by
the expression of Arx in a subset of GABAergic interneurons in young and mature
primary cultures of cortical neuronal cells as well as in vivo. Moreover, these
data could explain the occurrence of seizures in the great majority of patients
with an ARX mutation, due to mislocalisation or dysfunction of GABAergic neurons.
We also performed ARX wild-type and mutant over-expression experiments and found 
that the different ARX mutations tested did not modify the morphology of the
cells. Moreover, no abnormal cell death or protein aggregation was observed,
hence suggesting that more subtle pathogenic mechanisms are involved.

We recently identified mutations of ARX in nine genotypic males with X-linked
lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), and in several female relatives
with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). We now report 13 novel and
two recurrent mutations of ARX, and one nucleotide change of uncertain
significance in 20 genotypic males from 16 families. Most had XLAG, but two had
hydranencephaly and abnormal genitalia, and three males from one family had Proud
syndrome or ACC with abnormal genitalia. We obtained detailed clinical
information on all 29 affected males, including the nine previously reported
subjects. Premature termination mutations consisting of large deletions,
frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations in exons 1 to 4 caused
XLAG or hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia. Nonconservative missense
mutations within the homeobox caused less severe XLAG, while conservative
substitution in the homeodomain caused Proud syndrome. A nonconservative missense
mutation near the C-terminal aristaless domain caused unusually severe XLAG with 
microcephaly and mild cerebellar hypoplasia. In addition, several less severe
phenotypes without malformations have been reported, including mental retardation
with cryptogenic infantile spasms (West syndrome), other seizure types, dystonia 
or autism, and nonsyndromic mental retardation. The ARX mutations associated with
these phenotypes have included polyalanine expansions or duplications, missense
mutations, and one deletion of exon 5. Together, the group of phenotypes
associated with ARX mutations demonstrates remarkable pleiotropy, but also
comprises a nearly continuous series of developmental disorders that begins with 
hydranencephaly, lissencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum, and ends
with a series of overlapping syndromes with apparently normal brain structure.

Time-series profiles of gene expression generated by DNA microarrays possess
sufficient information for building dynamic models of transcriptional behavior.
This, however, requires properly designed experiments and sufficient independent 
data to validate such models. Here we report the use of AutoRegressive with
eXogenous input (ARX) models to fit dynamic gene expression data obtained by
subjecting cultures of the photosynthetic bacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 to
consecutive light-to-dark transitions. Autoregressive with exogenous input models
of appropriate complexity were selected by applying Akaike's information
criterion (AIC) such as to maximize agreement between model predictions with
experimental data without overfitting. These models were subsequently used to
design the experimental profile of an optimal validating data set. Predictions
from these models were tested in a second experiment and were found to match well
with the validation data. Additionally, the models with the least error in
predicting the expression profiles of the validation data set exactly match the
model complexity predicted by AIC. Such models offer insights into cellular
responses to environmental conditions and form the basis for hypothesizing and
quantifying relationships that are presently poorly understood at the level of
fundamental mechanisms.

Alaris AEP monitor's "Click Detection" does not help to detect inadvertent
disconnection of headphones during anesthesia.

    Anesth Analg. 2004 Sep;99(3):948-9; author reply 949.

Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be suppressed by anesthetics dose
dependently, but may fail to be registered because of the absence of adequate
auditory stimuli. The Alaris AEP monitor includes the "Click Detection" (CD)
(generating the message "NO AEP" or "LOW AEP") to detect the loss of auditory
stimuli. We investigated the accuracy of the CD in 17 patients awake (AWAKE) and 
during anesthesia (ANESTHESIA) with accurately placed headphones (HP) and after
disconnected HP (No HP) over 5 min each, respectively. Alaris AEP ARX index, CD, 
and Bispectral Index were recorded each minute. Changes were evaluated with the
Friedman and Wilcoxon test. Sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) and receiver 
operating characteristic curve were analyzed for the accuracy of the CD. During
AWAKE after disconnection of the HP, Alaris AEP ARX index decreased significantly
(P < 0.05). The CD was able to detect No HP after 2 min with a SEN of 88% and a
SPE of 97%. During ANESTHESIA, no changes were found after HP disconnection. CD
detected No HP with a SEN of 100% and a SPE of 20%. The CD of the Alaris AEP
monitor is not able to detect unnoticed disconnection of HP during
ANESTHESIA.IMPLICATIONS: Signal transmission of auditory evoked potentials can be
suppressed by anesthetics, but also by disconnection of headphones. In the
present study, we demonstrate that even the Alaris AEP monitor with the very new 
feature "Click Detection" was not able to detect the loss of headphones during
general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil.

Balancing different types of actin polymerization at distinct sites: roles for
Abelson kinase and Enabled.

Grevengoed EE(1), Fox DT, Gates J, Peifer M.

Author information: 
(1)University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, USA.

The proto-oncogenic kinase Abelson (Abl) regulates actin in response to cell
signaling. Drosophila Abl is required in the nervous system, and also in
epithelial cells, where it regulates adherens junction stability and actin
organization. Abl acts at least in part via the actin regulator Enabled (Ena),
but the mechanism by which Abl regulates Ena is unknown. We describe a novel role
for Abl in early Drosophila development, where it regulates the site and type of 
actin structures produced. In Abl's absence, excess actin is polymerized in
apical microvilli, whereas too little actin is assembled into pseudocleavage and 
cellularization furrows. These effects involve Ena misregulation. In abl mutants,
Ena accumulates ectopically at the apical cortex where excess actin is observed, 
suggesting that Abl regulates Ena's subcellular localization. We also examined
other actin regulators. Loss of Abl leads to changes in the localization of the
Arp2/3 complex and the formin Diaphanous, and mutations in diaphanous or capping 
protein beta enhance abl phenotypes.

Neuromuscular block with vecuronium reduces the rapidly extracted auditory evoked
potentials index during steady state anesthesia.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesiology, Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated Shanghai
First People'Hospital, Shanghai, China. steeroncn@yahoo.com.cn

PURPOSE: During clinical monitoring, vecuronium appeared to reduce the rapidly
extracted auditory evoked potentials index (A-line ARX index or AAI) to some
extent. A prospective and randomized study was designed to analyze this
phenomenon.
METHODS: Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery were studied. After
tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with an end-tidal isoflurane
concentration (F(ET)ISO) of 1.0% for 20 min, then a 10-mL dose of either
vecuronium 0.05 mg*kg(-1), 0.1 mg*kg(-1), 0.2 mg*kg(-1) or saline was
administered in a randomized, double-blind design. The AAI and bispectral index
(BI(hx)) were monitored throughout the study and analyzed off-line.
RESULTS: BI(hx) was unaltered after the administration of saline or vecuronium.
The mean of the averaged (per patient) AAI values recorded from two minutes to
ten minutes after the administration of saline or vecuronium 0.05 mg*kg(-1) did
not differ significantly from the corresponding mean recorded from 15 min to 20
min after F(ET)ISO maintained 1.0% (P = 0.678, 0.169), however after the
administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg*kg(-1) or 0.2 mg*kg(-1), AAI was reduced from
18.3, 18.0 to 14.8, 13.4 (P = 0.016, 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular block with vecuronium reduces AAI in patients during
steady state anesthesia without surgical stimuli, while BI(hx) is unaltered. The 
cut-off values of AAI for events should be determined according to the level of
neuromuscular blockade when monitoring the depth of anesthesia/sedation.

The ARX story (epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and cerebral malformations):
one gene leads to many phenotypes.

Sherr EH(1).

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Neurology and Pediatrics, University of California, San
Francisco, California 94143-0748, USA. esherr@itsa.ucsf.edu

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Infantile spasms, mental retardation, autism, and dystonia
represent disabling diseases for which little etiologic information is available.
Mutations in the Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX) have been found in
patients with these conditions. This discovery provides important genetic
information and may ultimately offer treatment options for these patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work has demonstrated that mutations in ARX cause
X-linked West syndrome, X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with spasticity and
intellectual disability, Partington syndrome (mental retardation, ataxia, and
dystonia), as well as nonsyndromic forms of mental retardation. Patients with
these aforementioned diseases and ARX mutations were not reported to have brain
imaging abnormalities. In contrast, mutations in ARX mutations have also been
found in X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, which typically includes
severe brain malformations (lissencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and
midbrain malformations), intractable seizures, and a severely shortened lifespan.
ARX knockout mice manifest defects in overall neuroblast proliferation as well as
selective abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneuron migration.
Consistent with these findings in mice, phenotype/genotype studies in humans
suggest that truncating mutations cause X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal
genitalia, and insertion/missense mutations result in epilepsy and mental
retardation without cortical dysplasia.
SUMMARY: Mutations in the homeobox gene, ARX, cause a diverse spectrum of disease
that includes cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and in another group of patients
severe cortical malformations. Although the precise prevalence of ARX mutations
is unclear, ARX may rival Fragile X as a cause of mental retardation and epilepsy
in males.

Opposing actions of Arx and Pax4 in endocrine pancreas development.

Gruss P.

(1)Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical
Chemistry, D-37077 Göttingen, Germany.

Genes encoding homeodomain-containing proteins potentially involved in endocrine 
pancreas development were isolated by combined in silico and nested-PCR
approaches. One such transcription factor, Arx, exhibits Ngn3-dependent
expression throughout endocrine pancreas development in alpha, beta-precursor,
and delta cells. We have used gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells to
generate Arx loss-of-function mice. Arx-deficient animals are born at the
expected Mendelian frequency, but develop early-onset hypoglycemia, dehydration, 
and weakness, and die 2 d after birth. Immunohistological analysis of pancreas
from Arx mutants reveals an early-onset loss of mature endocrine alpha cells with
a concomitant increase in beta-and delta-cell numbers, whereas islet morphology
remains intact. Our study indicates a requirement of Arx for alpha-cell fate
acquisition and a repressive action on beta-and delta-cell destiny, which is
exactly the opposite of the action of Pax4 in endocrine commitment. Using
multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), we demonstrate an accumulation of
Pax4 and Arx transcripts in Arx and Pax4 mutant mice, respectively. We propose
that the antagonistic functions of Arx and Pax4 for proper islet cell
specification are related to the pancreatic levels of the respective transcripts.

input-derived auditory evoked potentials, and predicted propofol concentrations
to measure patient responsiveness during anesthesia with propofol and
remifentanil.

BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare the performance accuracy of the
independent variables Bispectral Index (BIS), A-Line ARX index (AAI), and
predicted propofol effect-site concentration (CePROP) to measure the dependent
variables of loss of responses to different stimulation defined as loss of
response to verbal command (LORverbal), eyelash reflex (LORlash), and noxious
stimulus (LORnoxious) during stepwise increased levels of propofol infusion with 
and without remifentanil.
METHODS: Forty-five patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups (0,
2, and 4 ng/ml remifentanil) to receive graded CePROP and predicted effect
compartment controlled remifentanil (CeREMI). At every step, the ability to
respond to verbal command using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation
Scale (OAA/S), eyelash reflex, and electrical tetanic noxious stimulus were
compared against BIS, AAI, and CePROP. Prediction probability and
sensitivity/specificity were calculated.
RESULTS: Increasing CeREMI increased BIS and AAI values at LORverbal and LORlash 
and decreased CePROP. Similar findings were found for LORnoxious. The overall
prediction probability to measure the hypnotic component of anesthesia remained
accurate in the three groups for BIS, AAI, and CePROP. Combined information from 
CePROP, CeREMI, and BIS or AAI increased the overall prediction probability for
predicting the OAA/S scale and LORlash. Less accuracy to LORnoxious was found in 
all independent variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Although BIS, AAI, and CePROP were influenced by remifentanil during
propofol administration, their ability to detect OAA/S and LORlash remained
accurate. Improved performance is obtained when BIS and AAI are measured in
conjunction with drug targeted effect-site concentrations. Remifentanil decreases
the ability of these independent variables to detect LORnoxious.

Molecular requirements for actin-based lamella formation in Drosophila S2 cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California,
San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

Cell migration occurs through the protrusion of the actin-enriched lamella. Here,
we investigated the effects of RNAi depletion of approximately 90 proteins
implicated in actin function on lamella formation in Drosophila S2 cells. Similar
to in vitro reconstitution studies of actin-based Listeria movement, we find that
lamellae formation requires a relatively small set of proteins that participate
in actin nucleation (Arp2/3 and SCAR), barbed end capping (capping protein),
filament depolymerization (cofilin and Aip1), and actin monomer binding (profilin
and cyclase-associated protein). Lamellae are initiated by parallel and partially
redundant signaling pathways involving Rac GTPases and the adaptor protein Nck,
which stimulate SCAR, an Arp2/3 activator. We also show that RNAi of three
proteins (kette, Abi, and Sra-1) known to copurify with and inhibit SCAR in vitro
leads to SCAR degradation, revealing a novel function of this protein complex in 
SCAR stability. Our results have identified an essential set of proteins involved
in actin dynamics during lamella formation in Drosophila S2 cells.

Acupuncture facilitates neuromuscular and oculomotor responses to skin incision
with no influence on auditory evoked potentials under sevoflurane anaesthesia.

nina.kvorning@helsingborgslasrett.se

BACKGROUND: More sevoflurane was recently found to be required to prevent
movement in response to surgical incision in anaesthetized patients subjected to 
electro-acupuncture (EA) than to sham procedures. The present study was designed 
to compare differences in movement, dilatation of the pupils, divergence of the
eye axes and activity of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) between patients given
and those not given EA under standardized sevoflurane anaesthesia.
METHODS: Neuromuscular, oculomotor and AEP responses to skin incision were
assessed with and without a bilateral 2-Hz burst EA in patients under
steady-state anaesthesia maintained with 1.8% of sevoflurane. Forty-five healthy 
patients, scheduled for laparoscopic sterilization, were randomized for EA (n =
22) or sham (n = 23) procedures between induction of anaesthesia and start of
surgery. Middle latency AEP activity was recorded and interpreted by the A-line
ARX (autoregression with exogenous input) index (AAI).
RESULTS: More acupuncture than sham patients were found to respond to skin
incision with movement of the neck or limbs (77% vs. 43%; P = 0.021), dilatation 
of the pupils (77% vs. 39%; P = 0.001) and divergence of the eye axes (72% vs.
39%; P = 0.023), whereas there was no difference in AAI response.
CONCLUSION: Electro-acupuncture facilitates physiological responses to
nociceptive stimulation under sevoflurane anaesthesia. Differences in
neuromuscular and oculomotor responses between acupuncture and sham patients
under general anaesthesia are probably not associated with interaction between EA
and the depth of anaesthesia, as AEP activity was similar in the two groups.

We evaluated the effects of a bolus (0.4 mg.kg-1) and continuous infusion (1
mg.kg-1.h-1) of ketamine on Bispectral Index (BIS) and A-Line(R) ARX Index (AAI) 
during propofol anaesthesia. We included 15 ASA I patients scheduled for general 
anaesthesia. Induction was performed by infusion of propofol at 100 ml.h-1 until 
loss of consciousness. Both BIS and AAI monitors responded appropriately at that 
time. The calculated effect site concentration of propofol at loss of
consciousness was maintained by means of a computer controlled infusion system. A
'pseudo' steady-state effect site concentration was reached after 4 min. After 1 
min of baseline measurements, ketamine was administered. BIS values increased
from the 3rd to the 8th min after the administration of ketamine. The AAI showed 
no significant increase or decrease, but between-patient variability increased.

Crystal structures of engrailed homeodomain mutants: implications for stability
and dynamics.

Cambridge CB2 1GA, United Kingdom.

We report the crystal structures and biophysical characterization of two
stabilized mutants of the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain that have been
engineered to minimize electrostatic repulsion. Four independent copies of each
mutant occupy the crystal lattice, and comparison of these structures illustrates
variation that can be partly ascribed to networks of correlated conformational
adjustments. Central to one network is leucine 26 (Leu26), which occupies
alternatively two side chain rotameric conformations (-gauche and trans) and
different positions within the hydrophobic core. Similar sets of conformational
substates are observed in other Engrailed structures and in another homeodomain. 
The pattern of structural adjustments can account for NMR relaxation data and
sequence co-variation networks in the wider homeodomain family. It may also
explain the dysfunction associated with a P26L mutation in the human ARX
homeodomain protein. Finally, we observe a novel dipolar interaction between a
conserved tryptophan and a water molecule positioned along the normal to the
indole ring. This interaction may explain the distinctive fluorescent properties 
of the homeodomain family.

Isolation and in vitro and in vivo activity against Phytophthora capsici and
Colletotrichum orbiculare of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa strain GC-B26.

Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.

The bacterial strain GC-B26, which showed strong antifungal and anti-oomycete
activity against some plant pathogens, was isolated from a grassland soil in
Korea. Based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics,
GC-B26 was identical to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula. The antibiotic
G26A, active against Phytophthora capsici Leonian and Colletotrichum orbiculare
(Berk & Mont) van Arx, was isolated from the culture filtrates of Ps aeruginosa
strain GC-B26 using various chromatographic procedures. The EI mass and UV
spectral results indicated that G26A is an analogue of phenazines, having
molecular formula C13H8N2O2 (M+, m/z 224.0664). On the basis of NMR spectral
data, G26A was confirmed as phenazine-1-carboxylic acid. C orbiculare, P capsici 
and Pythium ultimum Trow were most sensitive to G26A, with MIC values of
approximately 5 microg ml(-1). However, no antimicrobial activity was found
against yeasts and bacteria, even at a concentration of over 100 microg ml(-1).
Treatment with the antibiotic gave highly significant protective activity against
the development of Phytophthora disease on pepper and anthracnose on cucumber
plants. The disease control efficacy was only slightly less than that of the
commercial fungicides metalaxyl and chlorothalonil.

Dynamic cerebral autoregulation assessment using an ARX model: comparative study 
using step response and phase shift analysis.

Liu Y(1), Birch AA, Allen R.

Author information: 
(1)Signal Processing & Control Group, Institute of Sound & Vibration Research,
University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.

Middle cerebral arterial blood velocity (MCAv) response to spontaneous and
manipulated changes of arterial blood pressure (ABP) was studied in eight
subjects using a linear autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model. ABP and 
MCAv were measured non-invasively by photoplethysmograph and transcranial Doppler
ultrasound, respectively. Data were recorded at rest (spontaneous changes in ABP)
and during thigh cuff (step-wise changes) and lower body negative pressure
(sinusoidal changes of 1/12 Hz) tests in both normocapnia and hypercapnia (5%
CO2). Since autoregulation is modulated by CO2, respiratory CO2 was
simultaneously monitored to allow comparison of cerebral autoregulation status
with different CO2 levels. ABP and MCAv were fitted by ARX models and dynamic
cerebral autoregulation was estimated by analysing both the step responses and
phase shift at the 1/12 Hz of the corresponding ARX models. The ARX model
consistently modelled the phase lead of MCAv to ABP and it showed that the phase 
shift at 1/12 Hz of ARX model is consistent with the real phase shift of the data
(p=0.59). Strong linear relationships between pCO2 and gradient of the step
response (r=-0.58, p<0.0001) and between pCO2 and phase shift (r=-0.76, p<0.0001)
were observed, which suggests that cerebral autoregulation can be assessed by
step response or phase shift analysis of the ARX model fitted to ABP and MCAv
data with spontaneous changes.

BACKGROUND: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound has been extensively used to study
cerebral hemodynamics, and yet the basic characteristics of the input/output
system of blood pressure/velocity are little known. We examine whether this
system can best be considered linear or non-linear.
METHODS: We assessed the adequacy of linear modeling in four ways: (1) Known
properties of cerebral blood flow were reviewed and analyzed from a systems
standpoint; (2) 1100 ARX & OE model types were tested with data from 29 normal
subjects, with and without lowpass filtering; (3) time-frequency analysis was
used to identify nonstationary behavior and markers of non-linearity (such as
bifurcations, chirps, and intermittent autoregulatory impairment) in the same
data sets; (4) simple computer models of autoregulation incorporating time delays
and non-linear elements were tested for production of spontaneous oscillations.
RESULTS: (1) Several aspects of cerebral hemodynamics are poorly described by
linear models, (2) the ARX & OE models performed poorly, (3) time-frequency
analysis showed non-linear and nonstationary behavior, (4) the computer models
produced spontaneous oscillations similar to those observed in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that the blood pressure/velocity system is 
non-linear.

Stabilization of CoI by ZnII in pure acetonitrile and its reaction with aryl
halides.

Université Paris 12, 2 - 8 rue H. Dunant, 94320 Thiais, France.

The study of the electrochemical behavior of cobalt(II) bromide (CoBr(2)) in pure
acetonitrile allowed us to demonstrate that Co(2+) is the catalyst precursor
involved in the electrochemical and chemical conversions of arylhalides, ArX, to 
arylzinc compounds in that solvent. The reduction of Co(2+) leads to the Co(+)
species, which disproportionates too rapidly to react further with aryl halides. 
However, the presence of zinc(II) bromide allows us to stabilize the
electrogenerated cobalt(I) and to observe it on the timescale of slow cyclic
voltammetry. Under such conditions, the Co(I) species has time to react with aryl
halides and produce [Co(III)ArX](+) complexes that are reduced into [Co(II)ArX]
by a single electron uptake at the same potential at which Co(2+) is reduced.
Rate constants for the oxidative addition of ArX to Co(I) have been determined
for various aryl halides and compared to the values obtained in an acetonitrile
(ACN)/pyridine (9:1, v/v) mixture. It is shown that Co(I) is stabilized more by
ZnBr(2) than by pyridine. A transmetallation reaction between [Co(II)ArX] and
ZnBr(2) has also been observed. We finally propose a mechanism for the
cobalt-catalyzed electrochemical conversion of aryl bromides into organozinc
species in pure acetonitrile.

X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) is a distinct form of
lissencephaly associated with absent corpus callosum. Recently, forms of
syndromic and nonspecific X-linked mental retardation have been found to be
associated with mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene ARX. The
authors assessed ARX as a candidate gene for XLAG in a genetic analysis of
neuronal migration disorders and found two different point mutations in two XLAG 
pedigrees affecting the homeodomain of the protein, confirming that ARX is a
causative gene for XLAG.

A new commercial auditory evoked potential (AEP) monitor (A-line AEP monitor) was
developed to calculate an index (ARX AEP index; AAI) by automatically using the
amplitudes and latencies of the AEP. We investigated 30 patients before spine
surgery. AAI; bispectral index (BIS); relative (%) delta, theta, alpha, and beta;
spectral edge frequency; median frequency; mean arterial blood pressure; heart
rate; and oxygen saturation were obtained simultaneously during stepwise (1.0
micro g/mL) induction of target-controlled propofol concentration until 5.0 micro
g/mL, followed by an infusion of 0.3 micro g. kg(-1). min(-1) of remifentanil.
Every minute, the patients were asked to squeeze the observer's hand. Prediction 
probability (Pk), receiver operating characteristic, and logistic regression were
used to calculate the probability to predict the conditions AWAKE,
UNCONSCIOUSNESS (first loss of hand squeeze), and steady-state ANESTHESIA (5.0
micro g/mL of propofol and 0.3 micro g. kg(-1). min(-1) of remifentanil).
Although a statistically significant difference among the conditions was observed
for AAI, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, median frequency, and %alpha, only
AAI and BIS were able to distinguish UNCONSCIOUSNESS versus AWAKE and ANESTHESIA 
versus AWAKE with better than Pk = 0.90. The modern electroencephalographic
variables AAI and BIS were superior to the classic electroencephalographic and
hemodynamic variables to distinguish the observed anesthetic
conditions.IMPLICATIONS: The modern electroencephalographic ARX-derived auditory 
evoked potential index and the bispectral index were superior to the classic
electroencephalographic and hemodynamic variables for predicting anesthetic
conditions. Variables derived from the auditory evoked potential did not provide 
an advantage over variables derived from spontaneous electroencephalogram.

Mental retardation (MR) is a symptom in a large group of clinical conditions and 
affects around 3% of the population. MR is divided into syndromic, if it is
characterized by distinctive clinical features and nonspecific when mental
retardation is the only defining manifestation. Although genetic causes of
X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) are heterogenous and complex, recent findings 
have led to the identification of an increasing number of genes involved in these
conditions. Eight genes involved in nonspecific X-linked mental retardation have 
been identified so far, including FMR2, GDI1, OPHN1, PAK3, ARHGEF6, IL1RAPL,
TM4SF2, and FACL4. Four other MECP2, RSK2, ARX, ATR-X are involved in syndromic
and nonspecific forms of MR. Recent research has shown that these genes encode
for proteins involved in signaling pathways which regulate cytoskeleton
organization, synaptic vesicle transport and establishment of connections between
neuronal cells. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of
crucial processes for the development of intellectual and cognitive functions.

X-linked West syndrome, also called "X-linked infantile spasms" (ISSX), is
characterized by early-onset generalized seizures, hypsarrhythmia, and mental
retardation. Recently, we have shown that the majority of the X-linked families
with infantile spasms carry mutations in the aristaless-related homeobox gene
(ARX), which maps to the Xp21.3-p22.1 interval, and that the clinical picture in 
these patients can vary from mild mental retardation to severe ISSX with
additional neurological abnormalities. Here, we report a study of two severely
affected female patients with apparently de novo balanced X;autosome
translocations, both disrupting the serine-threonine kinase 9 (STK9) gene, which 
maps distal to ARX in the Xp22.3 region. We show that STK9 is subject to
X-inactivation in normal female somatic cells and is functionally absent in the
two patients, because of preferential inactivation of the normal X. Disruption of
the same gene in two unrelated patients who have identical phenotypes (consisting
of early-onset severe infantile spasms, profound global developmental arrest,
hypsarrhythmia, and severe mental retardation) strongly suggests that lack of
functional STK9 protein causes severe ISSX and that STK9 is a second
X-chromosomal locus for this disorder.

BACKGROUND: The rapidly extracted auditory evoked potentials index (A-lineTM ARX 
Index or AAI) has been proposed as a method to measure the depth of anesthesia. A
prospective study was designed to assess the performance of AAI to detect the
recovery and loss of wakefulness in anesthetized and paralyzed patients.
METHODS: Fourteen adult patients undergoing elective surgery were anesthetized
with propofol 1.5 mg kg-1, vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 and further propofol 1.0 mg
kg-1. Wakefulness was measured by the ability of the patient to respond to
command using the isolated forearm technique (IFT). After the patient responded, 
propofol was infused at 10 mg kg-1. h-1 until wakefulness (responsiveness) was
lost. The AAI was recorded continuously throughout the study and analyzed
off-line.
RESULTS: The AAI showed a significant difference between the values registered
during, 30 s before and 30 s after the recovery, and also between 30 s before and
30 s after the loss of wakefulness. The prediction probability (Pk) values for
AAI were 0.786 and 0.864 during the transitions from unresponsiveness to
responsiveness and from responsiveness to unresponsiveness. The area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve for the responsive and unresponsive
values was 0.926 (SE 0.002, 95% CI 0.922-0.931), and the AAI values of
approximately 5%, 50% and 95% predicted probability of wakefulness were 19, 29
and 39, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The AAI may be a good predictor of recovery and loss of wakefulness
for anesthetized and paralyzed patients.

X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy: pathogenetic significance of ARX
mutations.

Mental retardation (MR) and epilepsy are both heterogeneous syndromes based on
dysfunction in the brain and they are often closely associated. Hence, there
should be some overlap in the underlying pathomechanisms, particularly when both 
syndromes result from genetic abnormalities, either polygenic or monogenic. Some 
50 monogenic causes of MR have been found in genes localized on the X-chromosome 
and are responsible for X-linked MR. In contrast, monogenic causes of about 30
epilepsy syndromes are transmitted as an autosomal trait. Early this year, an
X-chromosome-linked, Aristaless-related, homeobox gene, ARX, was found to be
associated with both X-linked MR and epilepsy. The epilepsy phenotypes included
West syndrome and other epilepsy phenotypes, indicating the genetic basis of the 
X-linked West syndrome. Another report implied that the ARX molecule plays a
crucial role in cognitive function. These findings provide solid evidence for the
relationship between MR and epilepsy at a molecular level, opening a new avenue
for understanding the pathogeneses of MR associated with epilepsy.

Lissencephaly and the molecular basis of neuronal migration.

Kato M(1), Dobyns WB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Human Genetics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637,
USA.

Migration of post-mitotic neurons from the ventricular zone to the cortical plate
during embryogenesis comprises one of the most critical stages in brain
development. Deficiency of this process often results in major brain
malformations, including human lissencephaly (smooth brain). Since discovery of
the first genetic cause of lissencephaly, deletions of chromosome 17p13.3 in
Miller-Dieker syndrome, rapid progress in our understanding of neuronal migration
has been made based on advances in both brain imaging technology and molecular
genetics. This progress has resulted in a new system of classification that began
with pathological descriptions and has evolved to include patterns on brain
imaging, causative genes and most recently the molecular pathways and proposed
modes of migration involved. In this review, we summarize current knowledge
regarding five genes that cause or contribute to human lissencephaly, including
LIS1, 14-3-3 epsilon, DCX, RELN and ARX. Each of these is associated with a
characteristic pattern of malformation that involves the cerebral cortex and
sometimes other brain structures. Based on detailed genotype-phenotype analysis, 
we can now infer the most likely causative gene based on brain imaging and other 
clinical findings, and inversely are becoming able to predict clinical severity
based on the specific mutations detected. We also hypothesize, for the first
time, a relationship between the specific type of lissencephaly observed and
deficiency of specific modes of neuronal migration.

Channelopathies as a genetic cause of epilepsy.

jmulley@bionomics.com.au

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes the significant number of new gene
associations with epilepsy syndromes that have emerged during the past year,
together with additional mutations and new electrophysiological data relating to 
previously known gene associations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Autosomal dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy was demonstrated 
to be a channelopathy associated with a GABA(A) receptor, alpha1 subunit
mutation. Benign familial neonatal infantile seizures were delineated as another 
channelopathy of infancy, by molecular characterization of sodium channel, alpha2
subunit defects. A sodium channel, alpha2 subunit defect was previously found to 
be associated with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. Similarly,
the clinical spectrum associated with potassium channel, KQT-like mutations was
extended to include the channelopathy myokymia and neonatal epilepsy. Mutations
in the non-ion channel genes, leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 gene and
Aristaless related homeobox gene, have emerged as important causes of their
specific syndromes, with mutations in the latter gene frequently underlying
X-linked mental retardation with epilepsy.
SUMMARY: All but one of the idiopathic epilepsies with a known molecular basis
are channelopathies. Where the ion channel defects have been identified, however,
they generally account for a minority of families and sporadic cases with the
syndrome in question. The data suggest that ion channel mutations of large effect
are a common cause of rare monogenic idiopathic epilepsies, but are rare causes
of common epilepsies. Additive effects of genetic variation, perhaps within the
same ion channel gene families, are likely to underlie the common idiopathic
generalized epilepsies with complex inheritance. The genetics of epilepsy is
progressing rapidly toward a more detailed molecular dissection and definition of
syndromes.

The novel Aristaless related homeobox gene, ARX, is widely expressed in the brain
and is thought to play a key role in the regulation of brain development.
Neurological phenotypes caused by ARX mutations have recently started to unfold. 
We describe a 72 year old man with X-linked mental retardation due to a 24 bp
duplication mutation in exon 2 of the ARX gene. Cerebral MRI showed bilateral
cystic-like cavities in both the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. No
retraction or expansion in neighbouring parenchyma was observed, there was no
history of acute neurological impairment, and no risk factors for cerebrovascular
disease were found. The lesions appeared to be congenital and represented benign 
developmental cysts, possibly caused by the ARX mutation.

Essential role of the C. elegans Arp2/3 complex in cell migration during ventral

Migration of cells through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is
essential for morphogenesis of multicellular animals. In a cell culture system,
the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex functions as a nucleation core for
actin polymerization when activated by the members of the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein) family. However, the regulation of cell motility in vivo
remains poorly understood. Here we report that homologues of the mammalian Arp2/3
complex and N-WASP in Caenorhabditis elegans play an important role in hypodermal
cell migration during morphogenesis, a process known as ventral enclosure. In the
absence of one of any of the C. elegans Arp2/3 complex subunits (ARX-1, ARX-2,
ARX-4, ARX-5, ARX-6 or ARX-7) or of N-WASP (WSP-1), hypodermal cell migration led
by actin-rich filopodia formation is inhibited during ventral enclosure owing to 
the reduction of filamentous actin formation. However, there is no effect on
differentiation of hypodermal cells and dorsal intercalation. Disruption of the
function of ARX-1 and WSP-1 in hypodermal cells also resulted in hypodermal cell 
arrest during ventral enclosure, suggesting that their function is cell
autonomous. WSP-1 protein activated Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization in
vitro. Consistent with these results, the Arp2/3 complex and WSP-1 colocalized at
the leading edge of migrating hypodermal cells. The stable localization of WSP-1 
was dependent on the presence of Arp2/3 complex, suggesting an interaction
between the Arp2/3 complex and WSP-1 in vivo.

It is unclear whether opioid-induced changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) or
auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) reliably correspond with consciousness. We
examined the correlation between 1) the clinically assessed state of
consciousness, 2) implicit and explicit memory (by use of word pairs), and 3)
various measures of EEG and AEP-bispectral index (BIS), A-Line ARX AEP index,
spectral entropy, and entropy of the singular value decomposition (SVDEN; a
measure of the complexity of the EEG). We studied 21 women during a two-stage
awakening (sevoflurane washout followed by remifentanil washout) after anesthesia
for gynecological surgery. All were amnesic, and 19 were unresponsive to verbal
command with remifentanil alone. In six patients, BIS decreased paradoxically as 
the remifentanil concentration decreased; this was caused by a low-amplitude EEG,
which was misinterpreted by the Aspect algorithm as burst suppression. Most of
the EEG/AEP variables were sensitive to the decrease in sevoflurane and the
recovery of consciousness, but not to the effects of decreasing remifentanil
concentrations. SVDEN was the only variable that demonstrated significant
increases for both the sevoflurane and remifentanil washout phases. With the
prediction probability statistic during remifentanil washout, SVDEN = 0.79,
spectral entropy = 0.81, A-Line ARX AEP index = 0.63, and BIS = 0.58. Entropy
measures appear to be worthy of further clinical evaluation in a larger series of
patients. SVDEN may be a useful variable for assessing anesthetic and analgesic
effects on the central nervous system.IMPLICATIONS: During the recovery phase
from a remifentanil-based anesthetic, the bispectral index is not reliably
predictive of the depth of consciousness, because of suppression ratio artifacts.
Entropy measures of the electroencephalogram show promise, but there is still no 
gold standard to estimate anesthetic depth.

The human aristaless-related homeobox ( ARX) gene is mutated in several patients 
with X-linked mental retardation and/or other neurologic pathologies. We report
the isolation and expression pattern of a Xenopus arx gene. Similar to other
vertebrate arx genes, Xenopus arx is expressed in the developing telencephalon,
diencephalon, and floor plate.

A Formin Homology protein and a profilin are required for cytokinesis and
Arp2/3-independent assembly of cortical microfilaments in C. elegans.

BACKGROUND: F-actin is enriched at the cortex of embryonic cells in the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans and is required for multiple processes that include the
establishment of an anterior-posterior (A-P) axis and cytokinesis. However, the
mechanisms that regulate cortical microfilament (MF) assembly remain poorly
understood.
RESULTS: We show here that a profilin called PFN-1 accumulates at the cortex
independent of the actin cytoskeleton and is required for the assembly or
maintenance of cortical MFs and myosin. Reducing PFN-1 levels by RNAi results in 
cytokinesis and A-P polarity defects. PFN-1 binds to the Formin Homology (FH)
protein CYK-1, which also is required for cortical MFs. In contrast to PFN-1 and 
CYK-1, the Arp2/3 complex appears to be dispensable for the assembly of cortical 
MFs, for A-P polarity, and for cytokinesis. Instead, the Arp2/3 complex is
required for cell migrations that occur during gastrulation and may also be
involved in cellular rearrangements required for epidermal enclosure prior to
elongation of ovoid embryos into vermiform larvae.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the FH protein CYK-1 and the profilin PFN-1 mediate
the Arp2/3-independent assembly of MFs and are required for cytokinesis in the
early embryo. These data suggest that CYK-1 and PFN-1 may nucleate MFs, as has
recently been shown for an FH protein and a profilin in yeast.

Analysis of dynamic cerebral autoregulation using an ARX model based on arterial 
blood pressure and middle cerebral artery velocity simulation.

Liu Y(1), Allen R.

Author information: 
(1)Signal Processing & Control Group, Institute of Sound & Vibration Research,
University of Southampton, UK.

The study aimed to model the cerebrovascular system, using a linear ARX model
based on data simulated by a comprehensive physiological model, and to assess the
range of applicability of linear parametric models. Arterial blood pressure (ABP)
and middle cerebral arterial blood flow velocity (MCAV) were measured from 11
subjects non-invasively, following step changes in ABP, using the thigh cuff
technique. By optimising parameters associated with autoregulation, using a
non-linear optimisation technique, the physiological model showed a good
performance (r=0.83+/-0.14) in fitting MCAV. An additional five sets of measured 
ABP of length 236+/-154 s were acquired from a subject at rest. These were
normalised and rescaled to coefficients of variation (CV=SD/mean) of 2% and 10%
for model comparisons. Randomly generated Gaussian noise with standard deviation 
(SD) from 1% to 5% was added to both ABP and physiologically simulated MCAV
(SMCAV), with 'normal' and 'impaired' cerebral autoregulation, to simulate the
real measurement conditions. ABP and SMCAV were fitted by ARX modelling, and
cerebral autoregulation was quantified by a 5 s recovery percentage R5% of the
step responses of the ARX models. The study suggests that cerebral autoregulation
can be assessed by computing the R5% of the step response of an ARX model of
appropriate order, even when measurement noise is considerable.

Male embryonic mice with mutations in the X-linked aristaless-related homeobox
gene (Arx) developed with small brains due to suppressed proliferation and
regional deficiencies in the forebrain. These mice also showed aberrant migration
and differentiation of interneurons containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic
interneurons) in the ganglionic eminence and neocortex as well as abnormal
testicular differentiation. These characteristics recapitulate some of the
clinical features of X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) in
humans. We found multiple loss-of-function mutations in ARX in individuals
affected with XLAG and in some female relatives, and conclude that mutation of
ARX causes XLAG. The present report is, to our knowledge, the first to use
phenotypic analysis of a knockout mouse to identify a gene associated with an
X-linked human brain malformation.

Changes in the rapidly extracted auditory evoked potentials index and the
bispectral index during sedation induced by propofol or midazolam under epidural 
block.

200080, China.

BACKGROUND: The bispectral index (BIS) and the rapidly extracted auditory evoked 
potentials index (A-line ARX Index or AAI) have been proposed as methods to
measure the depth of sedation. A prospective study was designed to assess the
performance of both these methods for measuring the depth of sedation induced by 
propofol or midazolam under epidural block.
METHODS: Thirty-two ASA I and II adult patients undergoing elective
gynaecological surgery under low-thoracolumbar epidural block were studied.
Eighteen patients received propofol (Group P: 20 mg bolus every 3 min) and 14
received midazolam (Group M: 0.5 mg bolus every 5 min) until an observer's
assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale score of 1 was achieved. AAI and
BIS were monitored for different OAA/S scores.
RESULTS: AAI and BIS decreased and increased following the changes on the
patients' OAA/S scores and correlated with sedation significantly. During the
onset phase, the coefficients of Spearman's rank correlation for AAI and BIS were
respectively 0.958 and 0.898 (P < 0.001) for Group P, and 0.973 and 0.945 (P <
0.001) for Group M. During the recovery phase in Group P, the coefficients were
respectively 0.946 and 0.702 (P < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that 
both AAI and BIS were linearly related to the OAA/S scores. The coefficients of
Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression for AAI were all greater than
those for BIS (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Both AAI and BIS correlated well with the depth of sedation induced 
by propofol or midazolam under epidural block. AAI may be more valuable when
monitoring depth of sedation.

Two families, originally diagnosed as having nonsyndromic X-linked mental
retardation (NSXLMR), were reviewed when it was shown that they had a 24-bp
duplication (428-45 1dup(24bp)) in the ARX gene [Stromme et al., 2002: Nat Genet 
30:441-445]. This same duplication had also been found in three other families:
one with X-linked infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia (X-linked West syndrome,
MIM 308350) and two with XLMR and dystonic movements of the hands (Partington
syndrome, MIM 309510). On review, manifestations of both West and Partington
syndromes were found in some individuals from both families. In addition, it was 
found that one individual had autism and two had autistic behavior, one of whom
had epilepsy. The degree of mental retardation ranged from mild to severe. A GCG 
trinucleotide expansion (GCG)10+7 and a deletion of 1,517 bp in the ARX gene have
also been found in association with the West syndrome, and a missense mutation
(1058C>T) in a family with a newly recognized form of myoclonic epilepsy, severe 
mental retardation, and spastic paraplegia [Scheffer et al., 2002: Neurology, in 
press]. Evidently all these disorders are expressions of mutations in the same
gene. It remains to be seen what proportions of patients with infantile spasms,
focal dystonia, autism, epilepsy, and nonsyndromic mental retardation are
accounted for by mutations in the ARX gene.

Arx is a homeobox-containing gene with a high degree of sequence similarity
between mouse and zebrafish. Arx is expressed in the forebrain and floor plate of
the developing central nervous systems of these vertebrates and in the
presumptive cortex of fetal mice. Our goal was to identify genes in Xp22.1-p21.3 
involved in human neuronal development. Our in silico search for candidate genes 
noted that annotation of a human Xp22 PAC (RPCI1-258N20) sequence (GenBank
Accession No. AC002504) identified putative exons consistent with an Arx
homologue in Xp22. Northern blot analysis showed that a 3.3kb human ARX
transcript was expressed at high levels in fetal brain. A 5.9kb transcript was
expressed in adult heart, skeletal muscle, and liver with very faint expression
in other adult tissues, including brain. In situ hybridization of ARX in human
fetal brain sections at various developmental stages showed the highest
expression in neuronal precursors in the germinal matrix of the ganglionic
eminence and in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon. Expression was also
observed in the hippocampus, cingulate, subventricular zone, cortical plate,
caudate nucleus, and putamen. The expression pattern suggests that ARX is
involved in the differentiation and maintenance of specific neuronal cell types
in the human central nervous system. We also mapped the murine Arx gene to the
mouse genome using a mouse/hamster radiation hybrid panel and showed that Arx and
ARX are orthologues. Therefore, investigations in model vertebrates may provide
insight into the role of ARX in development. The recent identification of ARX
mutations in patients with various forms of mental retardation make such studies 
in model organisms even more compelling.

The study of the electrochemical behavior of cobalt bromide, CoBr2, in the
presence of zinc bromide, ZnBr2, and aryl halides, ArX, in a dimethylformamide
(DMF)/pyridine (9:1, v/v) mixture allowed us to complete the study of the
mechanism of the electrochemical conversion of aryl halides into arylzinc
compounds by using cobalt catalysis. The last step of the catalytic process has
been shown to be a transmetalation reaction between the arylcobalt(II) species
and zinc ions that regenerates the cobalt(II) catalyst. The effect of zinc
bromide on each step of the catalytic cycle has been studied. It is especially
shown that the presence of ZnBr2 stabilizes the electrogenerated Co1 but has no
effect on the rate constant of the oxidative addition of aryl halides, ArX, to
Co1. Rate constants for the disproportionation reaction of Co1 and the oxidative 
addition have been determined in the presence of ZnBr2 and compared with the
values obtained in its absence.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a new syndrome of X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with
generalized spasticity and intellectual disability (XMESID) and identify the gene
defect underlying this disorder.
METHODS: The authors studied a family in which six boys over two generations had 
intractable seizures using a validated seizure questionnaire, clinical
examination, and EEG studies. Previous records and investigations were obtained. 
Information on seizure disorders was obtained on 271 members of the extended
family. Molecular genetic analysis included linkage studies and mutational
analysis using a positional candidate gene approach.
RESULTS: All six affected boys had myoclonic seizures and TCS; two had infantile 
spasms, but only one had hypsarrhythmia. EEG studies show diffuse background
slowing with slow generalized spike wave activity. All affected boys had moderate
to profound intellectual disability. Hyperreflexia was observed in obligate
carrier women. A late-onset progressive spastic ataxia in the matriarch raises
the possibility of late clinical manifestations in obligate carriers. The
disorder was mapped to Xp11.2-22.2 with a maximum lod score of 1.8. As recently
reported, a missense mutation (1058C>T/P353L) was identified within the
homeodomain of the novel human Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX).
CONCLUSIONS: XMESID is a rare X-linked recessive myoclonic epilepsy with
spasticity and intellectual disability in boys. Hyperreflexia is found in carrier
women. XMESID is associated with a missense mutation in ARX. This disorder is
allelic with X-linked infantile spasms (ISSX; MIM 308350) where polyalanine tract
expansions are the commonly observed molecular defect. Mutations of ARX are
associated with a wide range of phenotypes; functional studies in the future may 
lend insights to the neurobiology of myoclonic seizures and infantile spasms.

Comparison of conventional averaged and rapid averaged, autoregressive-based
extracted auditory evoked potentials for monitoring the hypnotic level during
propofol induction.

Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. hlitvan@hsp.santpau.es

BACKGROUND: The extraction of the middle latency auditory evoked potentials
(MLAEP) is usually done by moving time averaging (MTA) over many sweeps (often
250-1,000), which could produce a delay of more than 1 min. This problem was
addressed by applying an autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX) that
enables extraction of the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) within 15 sweeps. The 
objective of this study was to show that an AEP could be extracted faster by ARX 
than by MTA and with the same reliability.
METHODS: The MTA and ARX methods were compared with the Modified Observer's
Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAAS) in 15 patients scheduled for
cardiac surgery and anesthetized with propofol. The peak amplitudes and latencies
were recorded continuously for the MTA- and ARX-extracted AEP. An index, AAI, was
derived from the ARX-extracted AEP as well.
RESULTS: The best predictors of the awake and anesthetized states, in terms of
the prediction probability, Pk, were the AAI (Pk [SE] = 0.93 [0.01]) and Na-Pa
amplitude (MTA, Pk [SE] = 0.89 [0.02]; ARX, Pk [SE] = 0.87[0.02]). When comparing
the AAI at the MOAAS levels 5-3 versus 2-0, significant differences were
achieved. During the transitions from awake to asleep, the ARX-extracted AEP were
obtained with significantly less delay than the MTA-extracted AEP (28.4 s vs. 6
s).
CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that the MLAEP peaks and the AAI correlate well 
to the MOAAS, whether extracted by MTA or ARX, but the ARX method produced a
significantly shorter delay than the MTA.

Hospital, North Adelaide, SA 5006, Australia. petter.stromme@rikshospitalet.no

Clinical data from 50 mentally retarded (MR) males in nine X-linked MR families, 
syndromic and non-specific, with mutations (duplication, expansion, missense, and
deletion mutations) in the Aristaless related homeobox gene, ARX, were analysed. 
Seizures were observed with all mutations and occurred in 29 patients, including 
one family with a novel myoclonic epilepsy syndrome associated with the missense 
mutation. Seventeen patients had infantile spasms. Other phenotypes included mild
to moderate MR alone, or with combinations of dystonia, ataxia or autism. These
data suggest that mutations in the ARX gene are important causes of MR, often
associated with diverse neurological manifestations.

Sensorless estimation of pressure head and flow of a continuous flow artificial
heart based on input power and rotational speed.

Author information:

Center, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.

The present study has proposed a new method for estimating the pressure head
(P(t)[mm Hg]) and flow (Q(t)[L/min]) of a centrifugal pump on the basis of
voltage (V(t)[V]), current (I(t)[A]), and rotational speed (N(t)[k(rpm)]) of the 
DC motor for a pump without any additional sensors. In the proposed estimation
method, two auto-regressive exogenous (ARX) models are employed. One ARX model
has an output, P(t) or Q(t), and three inputs, VI(t) = V(t)I(t) and N(t) and the 
steady state gain (K) of the system from VI(t) to N(t). It can be assumed that K 
may include the information on viscosity of blood. The coefficient parameters of 
this ARX model are identified in an off-line fashion before implantation of the
pump. After implantation, P(t) or Q(t) is estimated by the same ARX model with
the already identified parameters. The other ARX model is used to identify Kon
the basis of VI(t) and N(t) in an on-line fashion every time the viscosity of
blood may change. In the experiment, a mock circulatory system consisting of a
centrifugal pump and a reservoir with 37% glycerin or water was employed. The
root mean square error between measured Q(t) and its estimate obtained from the
proposed method was 1.66L/min. On the other hand, a different method based on a
single ARX model with inputs of VI(t) and N(t), but without the additional input 
of K, yielded the corresponding estimation error of 2.22L/min. This means that
the proposed method can reduce its estimation error by about 25% in comparison
with a method that cannot cope with the change in blood viscosity.

Investigation of a critical region for an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR)
locus led us to identify a novel Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX ).
Inherited and de novo ARX mutations, including missense mutations and in frame
duplications/insertions leading to expansions of polyalanine tracts in ARX, were 
found in nine familial and one sporadic case of MR. In contrast to other genes
involved in XLMR, ARX expression is specific to the telencephalon and ventral
thalamus. Notably there is an absence of expression in the cerebellum throughout 
development and also in adult. The absence of detectable brain malformations in
patients suggests that ARX may have an essential role, in mature neurons,
required for the development of cognitive abilities.

BACKGROUND: Autoregressive modeling with exogenous input of middle-latency
auditory evoked potential (A-Line autoregressive index [AAI]) has been proposed
for monitoring anesthetic depth. The aim of the current study was to compare the 
accuracy of this new index with the Bispectral Index (BIS), predicted effect-site
concentration of propofol, and hemodynamic measures.
METHODS: Twenty female patients scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgery
received effect compartment controlled infusion of propofol. Target effect-site
concentration was started at 1.5 microg/ml and increased every 4 min by 0.5
microg/ml. At every step, sedation level was compared with monitoring values
using different clinical scoring systems and reaction to noxious stimulus.
RESULTS: Bispectral Index, AAI, and predicted propofol effect-site concentration 
were accurate indicators for the level of sedation and loss of consciousness.
Hemodynamic variables were poor indicators of the hypnotic-anesthetic status of
the patient. BIS correlated best with propofol effect-site concentration,
followed by AAI. Hemodynamic measurements did not correlate well. No indicators
predicted reaction to noxious stimulus. Poststimulus, BIS and AAI showed an
increase as a result of arousal. This reaction occurred more rapidly with the AAI
than with BIS.
CONCLUSION: Bispectral Index, AAI, and predicted propofol effect-site
concentration revealed information on the level of sedation and loss of
consciousness but did not predict response to noxious stimulus.

Formation of the neural tube plays a primary role in establishing the body plan
of the vertebrate embryo. Here we describe the phenotype and physical mapping of 
a highly penetrant X-linked male-lethal murine mutation, exma (exencephaly,
microphthalmia/anophthalmia), that specifically disrupts development of the
rostral neural tube and eye. The mutation arose from the random insertion of a
transgene into the mouse X Chromosome (Chr). Eighty-three percent of transgenic
male embryos display an open, disorganized forebrain and lack optic vesicles. No 
transgenic males survive beyond birth. Hemizygous females show a variable
phenotype, including reduced viability and occasional exencephaly and/or
microphthalmia. Altered or reduced expression patterns of Otx2, Pax6, Six3, and
Mrx, known markers of early forebrain and eye development, confirmed the highly
disorganized structure of the forebrain and lack of eye development in affected
exma male embryos. Physical mapping of the transgene by FISH localized a single
insertion site to the interval between Dmd and Zfx on the X Chr. A 1-Mb contig of
BAC clones was assembled by using sequences flanking the transgene and revealed
that the insertion lies close to Pola1 and Arx, a gene encoding a highly
conserved homeobox protein known to be expressed in the developing forebrain of
the mouse. Data from Southern blots of normal and transgenic DNA demonstrated
that a large segment of DNA encompassing Arx and including part of Pola1 was
duplicated as a result of the transgene insertion. From the physical mapping
results, we propose a model of the gross rearrangements that accompanied
transgene integration and discuss its implications for evaluating candidate genes
for exma.

Effect of sevoflurane on the mid-latency auditory evoked potentials measured by a
new fast extracting monitor.

Hospital, Odense, Denmark. alpiger@dadlnet.dk

BACKGROUND: Mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) are widely suppressed 
during general anesthesia and may therefore be useful for assessment of the depth
of anesthesia. However, interpretation of amplitudes and latencies in the AEP
signal is time consuming. A new monitor (A-line) that quantifies the MLAEP into
an index has therefore been developed. The present study aimed to assess the
precision of a prototype of the new monitor and to test the hypothesis that the
depth of anesthesia index shows a graded response with changing steady-state
end-expiratory concentrations of sevoflurane.
METHODS: We studied 10 ASA physical status I or II patients undergoing elective
hysterectomy under combined epidural and general anesthesia by sevoflurane.
Baseline auditory evoked potentials were recorded in the conscious patient
immediately before induction of general anesthesia. Depth of anesthesia indices
were recorded before anesthesia and at decreasing end-expiratory steady-state
sevoflurane concentrations of 2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.5%. All indices were
recorded in duplicate 6 s apart. By use of an autoregressive model with exogenous
input (ARX-model), the monitor extracted the AEP within 6 s. The depth of
anesthesia AEP index calculated in this way was defined as the A-line ARX index
(AAI).
RESULTS: Approximately 95% of the differences between repeated recordings were 5 
AAI-units or less. A wide interindividual variation was observed at each
observation point. AAI at 1%, 1.5% and 2% end-expiratory concentration was
significantly less than the baseline AAI obtained before induction of anesthesia 
(P < 0.001). AAI did not change significantly in the 1-2% concentration range.
CONCLUSION: The new monitor was precise. Attenuation of the A-line ARX-index
(AAI) for mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) during general
anesthesia was profound. However, the monitor did not show a graded response with
changing end-expiratory steady-state concentrations of sevoflurane.

Catalonia, Spain. hlitvan@hsp.santpau.es

BACKGROUND: Extraction of the middle latency auditory evoked potentials (AEP) by 
an auto regressive model with exogenous input (ARX) enables extraction of the AEP
within 1.7 s. In this way, the depth of hypnosis can be monitored at almost
real-time. However, the identification and the interpretation of the appropriate 
signals of the AEP could be difficult to perform during the anesthesia procedure.
This problem was addressed by defining an index which reflected the peak
amplitudes and latencies of the AEP, developed to improve the clinical
interpretation of the AEP. This index was defined as the A-line Arx Index (AAI).
METHODS: The AEP and AAI were compared with the Modified Observers Assessment of 
Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAAS) in 24 patients scheduled for cardiac
surgery, anesthetized with propofol or sevoflurane.
RESULTS: When comparing the AEP peak latencies and amplitudes and the AAI,
measured at MOAAS level 5 and level 1, significant differences were achieved.
(mean(SD) Nb latency: MOAAS 5 51.1 (7.3) ms vs. MOAAS 1: 68.6 (8.1) ms; AAI:
MOAAS 5 74.9 (13.3) vs. MOAAS 1 20.7 (4.7)). Among the recorded parameters, the
AAI was the best predictor of the awake/anesthetized states.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that both the AAI values and the AEP peak latencies and
amplitudes correlated well with the MOAAS levels 5 (awake) and 1 (anesthetized).

A discrete-time nonlinear Wiener model for the relaxation of soft biological
tissues.

Engineering, Politecnico Di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, 32, 20133 Milano,
Italy. quaglini@stru.polimi.it

The present paper is devoted to introducing discrete-time models for the
relaxation function of soft biological tissues. Discrete-time models are suitable
for the analysis of sampled data and for digital simulations of continuous
systems. Candidate models are searched for within both linear ARX structures and 
nonlinear Wiener models, consisting of an ARX element followed in cascade by a
polynomial function. Both these discrete-time models correspond to sampling
continuous-time exponential function series, thus preserving physical
interpretation for the proposed relaxation model. The estimation data set
consists of normalized stress relaxation curves drawn from experiments performed 
on samples of bovine pericardium. The normalized relaxation curves are found to
be almost insensitive to both the magnitude of strain and the loading direction, 
and so a single model for the whole relaxation curves is assumed. In order to
identify the parameters of the Wiener model an iterative algorithm is purposely
designed. Over the ARX one, the nonlinear Wiener model exhibits higher capability
of representing the experimental relaxation curves over the whole observation
period. The stability of the solution for the iterative algorithm is assessed,
and hence physical interpretation as material properties can be attached to the
parameters of the nonlinear model. Suitable features of the Wiener model for
computational application are also briefly presented.

Mental retardation and epilepsy often occur together. They are both heterogeneous
conditions with acquired and genetic causes. Where causes are primarily genetic, 
major advances have been made in unraveling their molecular basis. The human X
chromosome alone is estimated to harbor more than 100 genes that, when mutated,
cause mental retardation. At least eight autosomal genes involved in idiopathic
epilepsy have been identified, and many more have been implicated in conditions
where epilepsy is a feature. We have identified mutations in an X
chromosome-linked, Aristaless-related, homeobox gene (ARX), in nine families with
mental retardation (syndromic and nonspecific), various forms of epilepsy,
including infantile spasms and myoclonic seizures, and dystonia. Two recurrent
mutations, present in seven families, result in expansion of polyalanine tracts
of the ARX protein. These probably cause protein aggregation, similar to other
polyalanine and polyglutamine disorders. In addition, we have identified a
missense mutation within the ARX homeodomain and a truncation mutation. Thus, it 
would seem that mutation of ARX is a major contributor to X-linked mental
retardation and epilepsy.

Novel analogs of antisauvagine-30 (aSvg-30), a specific antagonist for
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor, type 2 (CRF(2)), have been
synthesized and characterized in vitro and in vivo. The N-terminal amino acid
D-phenylalanine in aSvg-30 was replaced by a D-tyrosine residue for specific
radioactive labeling with 123I. Additionally, Met(17) of aSvg-30 was substituted 
by norleucine and the N-terminus of the peptide was acetylated to increase in
vivo metabolic stability. The aSvg-30 analogs were tested for their ability to
displace [125I-Tyr(0)]Svg in binding experiments and to inhibit Svg-stimulated
adenylate cyclase activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, permanently
transfected with cDNA coding for the human CRF(1) (hCRF(1)), hCRF(2alpha) and
hCRF(2beta) receptor. Ac-[D-Tyr(11), His(12), Nle(17)Svg(11-40), named K31440,
showed high specific binding to hCRF(2alpha) (K(i) = 1.48 +/- 0.34 nM) and
hCRF(2beta) (K(i) = 2.05 +/- 0.61 nM) but not the hCRF(1) receptor (K(i) = 288
+/- 13 nM) and decreased Svg-stimulated cAMP activity in hCRF(2)-expressing cells
in a similar fashion as aSvg-30. In biodistribution studies specific uptake of
123I-K31440 was detected after 1 h in small intestine of BALB/c nude mice. These 
data demonstrate that 123I-K31440 may serve as a useful tool to detect native
CRF(2) receptors and elucidate their role in gastrointestinal disorders and
diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome or cancer.

Salt-excreting leaves of Atriplex halimus plants harvested in the central Negev
Highlands of Israel were screened for yeasts inhabiting their surfaces. Several
aerobic, moderately salt- and alkali-tolerant yeasts were isolated. One of the
isolates (tentatively designated S-8) was identified as Yarrowia lipolytica
(Wick.) van der Walt and Arx, on the basis of its morphological,
biochemical/physiological characteristics, and of quantitative chemotaxonomic and
molecular marker analyses. However, the strain is distinguished from the known
members of the type Y. lipolytica strain by its pronounced osmo-, salt-, and pH
tolerance. Cells displayed a unique capacity to grow over a wide pH range (from
3.5 to 11.5) with a pH optimum at 4.5 to 7.5. It is proposed that the S-8 strain 
be assigned to a single Y. lipolytica species as its anamorpha, or as a new
variety, Y. lipolytica var. alkalitolerance. The ecophysiological properties and 
biotechnological potentials of the new strain are discussed.

The "ligandless" palladium acetate-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of
ArX with aryl- and vinylboronic acids in water without organic cosolvent in the
presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide is reported. Aryl bromides give high
yields and considerably accelerate the coupling. A wide variety of functional

Middle-latency auditory evoked potentials during induction of thiopentone
anaesthesia in pigs.

Physiology, Frederiksberg C, Denmark. lmar@kvl.dk

A method is described for measuring middle-latency auditory evoked potentials
(MLAEP) in consciously awake, non-sedated pigs during the induction of
thiopentone anaesthesia (0.6 ml/kg, 2.5% thiopentone solution). It was done by
using autoregressive modelling with an exogenous input (ARX). The ability to
perceive pain during the induction was compared with (1) the changes in latencies
and amplitudes of the MLAEP, (2) the change in a depth of anaesthesia index based
on the ARX-model and (3) the change in the 95% spectral edge frequency. The
pre-induction MLAEP was easily recordable and looked much like the one in man,
dogs and rats. The temporal resolution in the ARX method was sufficiently high to
describe the fast changes occurring during induction of thiopentone anaesthesia. 
As previously reported from studies in man, dogs and rats, induction of
thiopentone anaesthesia resulted in significantly increased latencies and
decreased amplitudes of the MLAEP trace as well as in a significantly reduced
depth of anaesthesia index and spectral edge frequency. None of the changes,
however, related well to the ability to react to a painful stimulus. Whether an
ARX-based depth of anaesthesia index designed especially for pigs might be better
than the present index (designed for man) for assessing depth of anaesthesia must
await the results of further studies.

ICP-MS with hexapole collision cell for isotope ratio measurements of Ca, Fe, and
Se.

Boulyga SF(1), Becker JS.

Author information: 
(1)Radiation Physics and Chemistry Problems Institute, Minsk, Belarus.

To avoid mass interferences on analyte ions caused by argon ions and argon
molecular ions via reactions with collision gases, an rf hexapole filled with
helium and hydrogen has been used in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS), and its performance has been studied. Up to tenfold improvement in
sensitivity was observed for heavy elements (m > 100 u), because of better ion
transmission through the hexapole ion guide. A reduction of argon ions Ar+ and
the molecular ions of argon ArX+ (X = O, Ar) by up to three orders of magnitude
was achieved in a hexapole collision cell of an ICP-MS ("Platform ICP",
Micromass, Manchester, UK) as a result of gas-phase reactions with hydrogen when 
the hexapole bias (HB) was set to 0 V; at an HB of 1.6 V argon, and argon-based
ions of masses 40 u, 56 u, and 80 u, were reduced by approximately four, two, and
five orders of magnitude, respectively. The signal-to-noise ratio 80Se/ 40Ar2+
was improved by more than five orders of magnitude under optimized experimental
conditions. Dependence of mass discrimination on collision-cell properties was
studied in the mass range 10 u (boron) to 238 u (uranium). Isotopic analysis of
the elements affected by mass-spectrometric interference, Ca, Fe, and Se, was
performed using a Meinhard nebulizer and an ultrasonic nebulizer (USN). The
measured isotope ratios were comparable with tabulated values from IUPAC.
Precision of 0.26%, 0.19%, and 0.12%, respectively, and accuracy of 0.13% 0.25%, 
and 0.92%, respectively, was achieved for isotope ratios 44Ca/ 40Ca and 56Fe/57Fe
in 10 microg L(-1) solution nebulized by means of a USN and for 78Se/80Se in 100 
microg L(-1) solution nebulized by means of a Meinhard nebulizer.

Identification and control of dissolved oxygen in hybridoma cell culture in a
shear sensitive environment.

Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA.

The productivity of mammalian cells can be enhanced by facilitating adequate
oxygen transfer into the cultivation medium. However, current methods of
controlling dissolved oxygen (DO) fail to account for alterations in medium
composition during the course of the fermentation. These changes, which directly 
affect gas solubility and overall mass transfer coefficient, may be significant
and deteriorate controller's performance in the long run. In this paper, the
applications of Generalized Predictive Controllers (GPC) to DO control were
investigated in a shear sensitive environment and compared to PID and Model
Predictive Controllers (MPC). Input and output data for system identification
were initially generated by varying the composition of oxygen fed into the
bioreactor from 0 to 0.21 mol % while keeping the total inlet gas flow rate at
8.75 vvm. The process was identified using an AutoRegressive model with
eXogeneous inputs (ARX) model and tested on different data sets. The model
parameters were then correlated with the overall mass transfer coefficients. In
simulation tests, the output of the PID controller switched from minimum to
maximum values while more continuous control signals were obtained with the MPC
and GPC controllers. When tested in a cell-free medium, all three controllers
were able to track setpoint changes with some chattering observed in the control 
signals. The GPC outperformed the MPC and PID controllers when applied to the
cultivation of hybridoma cells.

A novel cis-acting element regulates HES-1 gene expression in P19 embryonal

The regulatory mechanisms of mammalian hairy and Enhancer of split homologue-1
(HES-1) genes were examined in mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (P19 cells).
Undifferentiated P19 stem cells expressed a basal level of the HES-1 gene,
whereas the expression of this gene was increased upon induction of the cells to 
a neural cell lineage using retinoic acid (RA). Reporter co-transfection analysis
identified an activating region within the upstream promoter region of HES-1 from
nucleotides -201 to -172. This activating region, called activating region X
(ARX), shows a high GC content and contains both an AP-2 binding motif and a
CCAAT box. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear proteins
extracted from P19 cells showed that ARX forms a specific DNA-protein complex.
Importantly, ARX-dependent transcription, as well as ARX-binding activity, was
significantly increased in P19 cells treated with RA. These results indicate that
ARX transduces signals that up-regulate HES-1 gene expression in response to
RA-treatment. Thus, a novel cis-acting element involved in HES-1 gene regulation 
that plays a role in RA-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells has been
identified.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) from the auditory system were investigated in 28 
post-operative cardiac patients in order to assess their relevance in the
monitoring of patient sedation level. Midazolam (17 patients) and propofol (11
patients) were the sedative agents used. The auditory ERP components of N100
(HAB100) and mismatch negativity (MMN) were considered. A single sweep method
based on the AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (ARX) model, which is able to
enhance the evoked responses to each single stimulus, was used to process each
sweep and to compute traditional parameters on a sweep-by-sweep basis.
Differences in the measured parameters were related to variations in the patient 
sedation levels classified through Ramsay score. Significant differences (P<0.05)
in both MMN and HAB100 parameters were found between light sedation (LS) and deep
sedation (DS) levels.

Changes in rapidly extracted auditory evoked potentials during tracheal
intubation.

Urhonen E(1), Jensen EW, Lund J.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Clinical Research, Odense University, Denmark. urhonen@email.dk

BACKGROUND: One of the problems encountered in assessment of the hypnotic level
during anesthesia is the extraction of a consistent and reliable measure online
and close to real time. Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and blood
pressure are not, at least with the traditional single parameter versus time
presentation, adequate for ensuring an optimal level of anesthesia, especially
when using neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). In the literature, it has been
demonstrated that auditory evoked potentials (AEP) are able to provide two
aspects relevant to determining level of anesthesia: firstly, they have
identifiable anatomical significance and, secondly, their characteristics reflect
the way the brain perceives a stimulus.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the AEP index based on a system
identification model, the autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX-model), 
and to compare it to the classical method, the moving time average (MTA). The ARX
enables the extraction within 15-25 sweeps, depending on the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), whereas MTA typically needs 250-500 sweeps. The hypothesis of the
present study was that since the ARX-model extracts the AEP faster than the
MTA-model, the former should be able to detect changes during the brief, intense 
stimulus of endotracheal intubation. Twelve female patients scheduled for
gynecological surgery were included in the study. Anesthesia was initiated with
thiopentone and maintained with isoflurane and alfentanil. The AEP was mapped
into an index (AEP-index) normalized to 100 when the individual was awake and
decreasing to an average of 25 during thiopentone induced anaesthesia. The
results were compared to those obtained by MTA-extracted AEP.
RESULTS: During tracheal intubation 9 patients showed an increase in the
ARX-extracted AEP-index larger than 15, and 6 of these patients showed an
increase larger than 25 (mean increase=33, SD=18). The MTA-extracted AEP-index
showed only one patient with an increase larger than 15. The ARX-extracted AEP
changed significantly faster than the MTA-extracted AEP.
CONCLUSION: The ARX-extracted AEP-index increases during tracheal intubation.
There is a significant difference between the ARX-extracted AEP and the
traditional MTA-extracted AEP, in terms of response time. In order to trace
short-lasting changes in the hypnotic level by AEP, the AEP should be extracted
by a method with a fast response such as the ARX-model.

High-affinity binding of urocortin and astressin but not CRF to G
protein-uncoupled CRFR1.

Rühmann A(1), Bonk I, Köpke AK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Neuroendocrinology, Max Planck Institute for
Experimental Medicine, Göttingen, Germany. arx@ansto.gov.au

The structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the recently identified
neuropeptide urocortin (Ucn) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor,
type 1 (CRFR1), has been investigated. To this end, rat Ucn (rUcn), ovine CRF
(oCRF) and chimeric peptides of rUcn and oCRF were synthesized and tested for
their binding affinity and potency to stimulate cAMP production in human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding rat CRFR1 
(rCRFR1). In binding studies with [125I-TyrO]oCRF or [3H-Leu9]rUcn as
radioligand, it was observed that rUcn but not oCRF bound in a similar fashion as
the CRF antagonist astressin with high affinity to rCRFR1 coupled to G protein or
uncoupled from G protein by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS).
Consequently, rUcn was found to exert a significantly lower potency than oCRF to 
stimulate cAMP accumulation in transfected cells. CD spectroscopic investigations
and reverse-phase HPLC (RPHPLC) retention behavior of the peptides suggested a
more pronounced amphipatic alpha-helical character of rUcn when compared to oCRF 
and the chimeric peptides.

Comparison of orthogonal search and canonical variate analysis for the
identification of neurobiological systems.

Wu YT(1), Sun M, Krieger D, Sclabassi RJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Computer Science, National Chi-Nan University, Taiwan.

In this paper, we investigate two general methods of modeling and prediction
which have been applied to neurobiological systems, the orthogonal search (OS)
method and the canonical variate analysis (CVA) approach. In these methods,
nonlinear autoregressive moving average with observed inputs (ARX) and state
affine models are developed as one step predictors by minimizing the
mean-squared-error. An unknown nonlinear time-invariant system is assumed to have
the Markov property of finite order so that the one step predictors are finite
dimensional. No special assumptions are made about model terms, model order or
state dimensions. Three examples are presented. The first is a numerical example 
which demonstrates the differences between the two methods, while the last two
examples are computer simulations for a bilinear system and the Lorenz attractor 
which can serve as a model for the EEG. These two methods produce comparable
results in terms of minimizing the mean-square-error; however, the OS method
produces an ARX model with fewer terms, while the CVA method produces a state
model with fewer state dimensions.

Modelling the relationship between peripheral blood pressure and blood volume
pulses using linear and neural network system identification techniques.

Allen J(1), Murray A.

Author information: 
(1)Regional Medical Physics Department, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne,
UK. j.allen@ncl.ac.uk

The relationships between peripheral blood pressure and blood volume pulse
waveforms can provide valuable physiological data about the peripheral vascular
system, and are the subject of this study. Blood pressure and volume pulse
waveforms were collected from 12 normal male subjects using non-invasive optical 
techniques, finger arterial blood pressure (BP, Finapres: Datex-Ohmeda) and
photoelectric plethysmography (PPG) respectively, and captured to computer for
three equal (1 min) measurement phases: baseline, hand raising and hand elevated.
This simple physiological challenge was designed to induce a significant drop in 
peripheral blood pressure. A simple first order lag transfer function was chosen 
to study the relationship between blood pressure (system input) and blood volume 
pulse waveforms (system output), with parameters describing the dynamics (time
constant, tau) and input-output gain (K). Tau and K were estimated for each
subject using two different system identification techniques: a recursive
parameter estimation algorithm which calculated tau and K from a linear
auto-regressive with exogenous variable (ARX) model, and an artificial neural
network which was trained to learn the non-linear process input-output
relationships and then derive a linearized ARX model of the system. The
identification techniques allowed the relationship between the blood pressure and
blood volume pulses to be described simply, with the neural network technique
providing a better model fit overall (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon). The median falls in
tau following the hand raise challenge were 26% and 31% for the linear and neural
network based techniques respectively (both p < 0.05, Wilcoxon). This preliminary
study has shown that the time constant and gain parameters obtained using these
techniques can provide physiological data for the clinical assessment of the
peripheral circulation.

aortic pressure by radial tonometry.

Aortic pressure can be estimated noninvasively by applying a transfer function
(TF) to radial tonometry signals. This study compares the performance of prior
approaches, based on Fourier transform and inverted aortic-to-radial model, with 
direct radial-to-aortic autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model. Simultaneous
invasive aortic pressure and radial tonometry pressure were recorded during rest 
in 39 patients in the supine position. Individual radial-aortic TF's were
estimated from 20 patients, and the average TF was used to predict aortic
pressures in the remaining 19 patients. The direct average TF yielded accurate
aortic systolic pressure estimation (error 0.4 +/- 2.9 mmHg) and good
reproduction of the aortic pressure waveform (root mean squared error 2.2 +/- 0.9
mmHg). The inverted reverse TF (aortic radial) yielded comparable results, while 
the Fourier-based TF had worse performance. Individual direct TF provided
improved predictive accuracy only for indexes which are based on higher frequency
components of the waveform (augmentation index, systolic time period). An ARX
average TF can be used to accurately estimate central aortic pressure waveform
parameters from noninvasive radial pulse tracings, and its performance is
superior to previous techniques.

Spatial and temporal distribution enhancement of movement-related brain
macropotentials.

Engineering, Università La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.

Conventional brain maps suffer from severe limitations due to both the spatial
blur of potential distributions and the dependence on electrical reference. The
surface Laplacian (SL) has been used to deblur movement-related brain
macropotentials (MRBM) since it acts as a high-pass spatial filter that reduces
the head volume conductor effects. Moreover, the method usually employed to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the well-known synchronized average.
However, this method is no longer valid when the object of the study is the
sweep-by-sweep variability. In this case, the SNR of original and
Laplacian-transformed single-sweep MRBM can be improved by autoregressive with
exogenous input (ARX) filtering. In our study, isolated or combined ARX and SL
are applied to enhance the spatial distributions of single-sweep MRBM associated 
with unilateral voluntary self-paced finger movements in humans. It shows that
single-sweep brain mappings are more coherent to physiological findings when ARX 
is first used followed by SL.

Evaluation of linear diaphragm-chest expansion models for magnetic resonance
imaging motion artifact correction.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA,
USA.

The efficacy of Fourier analysis, autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) and
adaptive models to estimate diaphragm position from respiratory belt signal (a
measure of chest expansion) was evaluated for the purpose of correcting
respiratory motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Respiratory
belt signal and diaphragm position data were obtained simultaneously during
one-dimensional MRI scans with sampling intervals of 100 ms for 128 s (1280
samples). The models were trained using the first 512 data samples for the
Fourier method and the first 640 samples for the ARX and adaptive methods. The
remaining samples were used as a test set for evaluating the models. Both ARX and
adaptive methods produced more accurate results than the Fourier method as
reflected by the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and correlation coefficient 
(R) between the estimated and actual diaphragm position during normal breathing
(P < 0.05). However, all three models had difficulty modeling diaphragm positions
during breathing plateaus.

Identification of causal relations between haemodynamic variables, auditory
evoked potentials and isoflurane by means of fuzzy logic.

Author information: 
(1)Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Dep. ESAII, Centre de Recerca en
Enginyería Biomèdica, Barcelona, Spain.

The aim of this study was to identify a possible relationship between
haemodynamic variables, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and inspired fraction of
isoflurane (ISOFl). Two different models (isoflurane and mean arterial pressure) 
were identified using the fuzzy inductive reasoning (FIR) methodology. A fuzzy
model is able to identify non-linear and linear components of a causal
relationship by means of optimization of information content of available data.
Nine young female patients undergoing hysterectomy under general anaesthesia were
included. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), end-tidal expired carbon
dioxide (CO2ET), AEP and ISOFl were monitored with a sampling time of 10 s. The
AEP was extracted using an autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX model) 
which decreased the processing time compared with a moving time average. The AEP 
was mapped into a scalar, termed the depth of anaesthesia index (DAI) normalized 
to 100 when the patient was awake and descending to an average of 25 during loss 
of consciousness. The FIR methodology identified those variables among the input 
variables (MAP, HR, CO2ET, DAI or ISOFl) that had the highest causal relation
with the output variables (ISOFl and MAP). The variables with highest causal
relation constitute the ISOFl and MAP models. The isoflurane model predicted the 
given anaesthetic dose with a mean error of 12.1 (SD 10.0)% and the mean arterial
pressure model predicted MAP with a mean error of 8.5 (7.8)%.

On-line analysis of middle latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) for
monitoring depth of anaesthesia in laboratory rats.

Biomedical Engineering, Barcelona, Spain. eweber@iri.upc.es

In laboratory animals as well as in human beings a depth of anaesthesia, where
the subject has no pain or recall of events from the surgery, should be provided.
Haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure are not a guarantee
for an optimal depth of anaesthesia, especially when using neuromuscular blocking
agents (NMBA). A number of studies suggest that the Middle Latency Auditory
Evoked Potentials (MLAEP) contain information about the state of consciousness in
humans. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the AEP could serve as
an indicator of depth of anaesthesia in rats. The AEP was elicited with a click
stimulus and monitored in an 80 ms window synchronised to the stimulus. The AEP
was extracted applying an Auto Regressive Model with Exogenous Input (ARX-model) 
from which a Depth of Anaesthesia Index (DAI) was calculated. DAI was normalised 
to 100 while awake and decreasing gradually to a level between 50 and 20 as the
rat was anaesthetised. Nine rats were anaesthetised and included in the study.
Four doses of Hypnorm vet. and Dormicum were given as a total, each with 5
minutes interval. Clinical signs of the level of anaesthesia were observed
simultaneously with the AEP. The results showed that in four rats DAI decreased
to a level below 30 while anaesthetised. In the remaining five rats the AEP was
only decreased to a level below 45. The results indicated that a simple dosing
regimen based on weight was unable to give the same depth of anaesthesia in
individual rats. The decrease in the DAI correlated well with the loss of
stimulus response. In conclusion, MLAEP could be used as an indicator of depth of
anaesthesia in rats during Hypnorm vet. and Dormicum administration. However
studies applying other anaesthetic drugs should be carried out, before a
conclusion of the general utility of the method can be made.

Adaptive pole placement control algorithm for DO-control in beta-lactamase
production.

Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA.

The dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important variable in aerobic fermentations and
affects the cell growth and product formation. Dissolved oxygen control is
difficult in batch fermentations because of the time-varying conditions, time
delays, and the probe dynamics. Modeling of the various patterns of biological
activity in fermentations and their impact on the DO process dynamics is
essential to both achieve a satisfactory control and to track the aforementioned 
patterns. An adaptive pole placement algorithm with time-delay compensation was
used for controlling the DO, coupled with system identification using recursively
estimated autoregressive models with exogeneous inputs (ARX). The flow rate of O2
in a constant flow rate gas inlet mixture is used as the manipulated variable.
Supervision and coordination techniques are applied to improve the control
performance. The control performance is affected by the accuracy of the model
prediction and the selected time delay. The effect of DO level on the
productivity of beta-lactamase using Bacillus subtilis under oxygen-limited
conditions is investigated. Beta-lactamase stability is improved under prolonged 
growth conditions with low DO levels.

A modulator of neurite outgrowth, designated S19159, was isolated from the
fermentation broth of fungal strain 19159. This fungus was identified as the
loculoascomycete, Preussia aemulans (Rehm) von Arx. In the presence of S19159,
the number of neurites extending from the cell bodies of cerebral cortical
neurons was markedly reduced. The effect of S19159 was observed specifically in
neurons from the central nervous system. The compound exhibited similar
activities on cultured cortical, hippocampal and cerebeller neurons but was
without detectable effect on dorsal root ganglion neurons and PC12 cells.

Achieving and monitoring adequate depth of anaesthesia is a challenge to the
anaesthetist. With the introduction of muscle relaxing agents, the traditional
signs of awareness are often obscured or difficult to interpret. These signs
include blood pressure, heart rate, pupil size, etc. However, these factors do
not describe the depth of anaesthesia, (DA), in a cerebral activity sense, hence 
there is a desire to achieve a better measure of the DA. Auditory Evoked
Potentials (AEP) provide two aspects relevant to anaesthesia: (1) they have
identifiable anatomical significance and, (2) their characteristics reflect the
way in which the brain reacts to a stimulus. However, AEP is embedded in noise
from the ongoing EEG background activity. Hence, processing is needed to improve 
the signal to noise ratio. The methods applied were moving time averaging (MTA)
and ARX-modeling. The EEG was collected from the left hemisphere and analysed by 
FFT to 1 sec epochs and the spectral edge frequency was calculated. Both the
changes in ARX extracted AEP and the spectral edge frequency of the EEG
correlated well with the time interval between propofol induction and onset of
anaesthesia measured by clinical signs (i.e., cessation of eye-lash reflex). The 
MTA extracted AEP was significantly slower in tracing the transition from
consciousness to unconsciousness.

The Brx1 homeobox gene has been isolated and shown to be expressed in the zona
limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) of the mouse embryo. Brx1 is a member of the Brx
gene family and comprises the genes for Brx1a and Brx1b, which differ in the
sequence in the region located on the 5'-terminal side of the homeobox. The
complete amino acid sequences of the open reading frame of Brx1a and Brx1b were
determined and each was found to be similar to that of Rgs, the mouse homologue
of the Rieger syndrome associated human RIEG gene (RGS), to the extent that the
sequence of Rgs has been clarified. Brx1 was strongly expressed in the mammillary
area as well as in the ZLI of the mouse embryonic brain. Homologues of Brx1a and 
Brx1b were isolated in chick in which the expression of Brx1 in the ventral
diencephalon was well conserved. The expression of Brx1 along with that of Sonic 
hedgehog (Shh), Nkx2.2, Dlx1 and Arx was examined at the time of the formation of
ZLI in mouse embryos. The expression of Shh was initially noted in the
ventricular zone of the presumptive ZLI and was then replaced by that of Brx1 at 
the time of radial migration of the neuroepithelial cells. Nkx2.2 was widely
expressed in the ventricular zone of presumptive ZLI and also as a narrow band in
the mantle zone. The expression of Dlx1 and Arx in the presumptive ventral
thalamus extended as far as ZLI and overlapped with that of Brx1. The Dlx1- and
Arx-expressing cells in ZLI, which extended towards the lateral (pial) surface of
the diencephalic wall, differed from those expressing Nkx2.2 and Brx1. The
embryonic ventral lateral geniculate nucleus present in the visual pathway was
eventually formed from these cells. Each homeobox gene was also expressed
regionally in the nucleus, suggesting that the nucleus is comprised of
subdivisions.

Israel.

A 7.4-kilobase (kb) DNA plasmid was isolated from Glomerella musae isolate 927
and designated pGML1. Exonuclease treatments indicated that pGML1 was a linear
plasmid with blocked 5' termini. Cell-fractionation experiments combined with
sequence-specific PCR amplification revealed that pGML1 resided in mitochondria. 
The pGML1 plasmid hybridized to cesium chloride-fractionated nuclear DNA but not 
to A + T-rich mitochondrial DNA. An internal 7.0-kb section of pGML1 was cloned
and did not hybridize with either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA from G. musae.
Sequence analysis revealed identical terminal inverted repeats (TIR) of 520 bp at
the ends of the cloned 7.0-kb section of pGML1. The occurrence of pGML1 did not
correspond with the pathogenicity of G. musae on banana fruit. Four additional
isolates of G. musae possessed extrachromosomal DNA fragments similar in size and
sequence to pGML1.

Analysis of abnormal signals within the QRS complex of the high-resolution
electrocardiogram.

Author information:

Venezuela.

This paper presents a new, quantitative approach to measuring abnormal intra-QRS 
signals, using the high-resolution electrocardiogram (HRECG). These signals are
conventionally known as QRS "notches and slurs." They are measured qualitatively 
and form the basis for the ECG identification of myocardial infarction. The HRECG
is used for detection of ventricular late potentials (LP), which are linked with 
the presence of a reentry substrate for ventricular tachycardia (VT) after a
myocardial infarction. LP's are defined as signals from areas of delayed
conduction which outlast the normal QRS period. Our objective is to quantify very
low-level abnormal signals that may not outlast the normal QRS period. In this
work, abnormal intra-QRS potentials (AIQP) were characterized by removing the
predictable, smooth part of the QRS from the original waveform. This was
represented as the impulse response of an ARX parametric model, with model order 
selected empirically from a training data set. AIQP were estimated using the
residual of the modeling procedure. Critical AIQP parameters to separate VT and
non-VT subjects were obtained using discriminant functions. Results suggest that 
AIQP indexes are a new predictive index of the HRECG for VT. The concept of
abnormal intra-QRS potentials permits the characterization of pathophysiological 
signals contained wholly within the normal QRS period, but related to
arrhythmogenesis. The new method may have other applications, such as detection
of myocardial ischemia and improved ECG identification of the site of myocardial 
infarction, particularly in the absence of Q waves.

Expression of a novel aristaless related homeobox gene 'Arx' in the vertebrate
telencephalon, diencephalon and floor plate.

Author information: 
(1)Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Machida-shi, Tokyo, Japan.

We have isolated a novel homeobox gene that is expressed in the vertebrate
central nervous system and which shows striking similarity to the Drosophila al
gene in the homeodomain (85% identity) and in a 17 amino acid-sequence near the
carboxyl-terminus. This gene was designated Arx (aristaless related homeobox
gene) in consideration of its structural similarity to the al gene. Arx was
highly conserved between mouse and zebrafish. Neuromeric expression in the
forebrain and longitudinal expression in the floor plate were observed in mouse
and zebrafish. The expression of Arx in the ganglionic eminence and ventral
thalamus overlapped regionally with that of Dlx1, but the cell layer where Arx is
expressed differed from that of the Dlx1. This gene was also found to be
expressed in the dorsal telencephalon (presumptive cerebral cortex) of mouse
embryos. The structure and expression pattern of Arx with respect to any possible
relationship to al and Dlx1, as well as the function of Arx in the floor plate
are discussed.

Parametric and non-parametric estimation of speech formants: application to
infant cry.

Fort A(1), Ismaelli A, Manfredi C, Bruscaglioni P.

Author information: 
(1)Electronic Engineering Department, University of Florence, Italy.

The present paper addresses the issue of correctly estimating the peaks in the
speech envelope (formants) occurring in newborn infant cry. Clinical studies have
shown that the analysis of such spectral characteristics is a helpful noninvasive
diagnostic tool. In fact it can be applied to explore brain function at very
early stage of child development, for a timely diagnosis of neonatal disease and 
malformation. The paper focuses on the performance comparison between some
classical parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques particularly well
suited for the present application, specifically the LP, ARX and cepstrum
approaches. It is shown that, if the model order is correctly chosen, parametric 
methods are in general more reliable and robust against noise, but exhibit a less
uniform behaviour than cepstrum. The methods are compared also in terms of
tracking capability, since the signals under study are nonstationary. Both
simulated and real signals are used in order to outline the relevant features of 
the proposed approaches.

Autoregressive modeling with exogenous input of middle-latency auditory-evoked
potentials to measure rapid changes in depth of anesthesia.

Jensen EW(1), Lindholm P, Henneberg SW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Odense University Hospital,
Denmark.

Obtaining an adequate depth of anesthesia is a continuous challenge to the
anesthetist. With the introduction of muscle-relaxing agents the traditional
signs of awareness are often obscured, or difficult to interpret. These signs
include blood pressure, heart rate, pupil size, etc. However, these factors do
not describe the depth of anesthesia (DA) in a cerebral activity sense. Hence, a 
better measure of the DA is required. It has been suggested that Auditory-Evoked 
Potentials (AEP) can provide additional information about the DA. The general
method of extracting AEP is by use of a Moving Time Average (MTA). However, the
MTA is time consuming because a large number of repetitions is needed to produce 
an estimate of the AEP. Hence, changes occurring over a small number of sweeps
will not be detected by the MTA average. We describe a system-identification
method, an autoregressive model with exogeneous input (ARX) model, to produce a
sweep-by-sweep estimate of the AEP. The method was clinically evaluated in 10
patients anesthetized with alfentanil and propofol. The time interval between
propofol induction and the time when the Na-Pa amplitude was decreased to 25% of 
the initial amplitude was measured. These measurements showed that ARX-estimated 
compared to MTA-estimated AEP was significantly faster in tracing transition from
consciousness to unconsciousness during propofol induction (p < 0.05).

Learning temporal probabilistic causal models from longitudinal data.

Riva A(1), Bellazzi R.

Author information: 
(1)Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Università di Pavia, Italy.

Medical problems often require the analysis and interpretation of large
collections of longitudinal data in terms of a structural model of the underlying
physiological behavior. A suitable way to deal with this problem is to identify a
temporal causal model that may effectively explain the patterns observed in the
data. Here we will concentrate on probabilistic models, that provide a convenient
framework to represent and manage underspecified information; in particular, we
will consider the class of Causal Probabilistic Networks (CPN). We propose a
method to perform structural learning of CPNs representing time-series through
model selection. Starting from a set of plausible causal structures and a
collection of possibly incomplete longitudinal data, we apply a learning
algorithm to extract from the data the conditional probabilities describing each 
model. The models are then ranked according to their performance in
reconstructing the original time-series, using several scoring functions, based
on one-step ahead predictions. In this paper we describe the proposed methodology
through an example taken from the diabetes monitoring domain. The selection
process is applied to a set of input-output models that generalize the class of
ARX models, where the inputs are the insulin and meal intakes and the outputs are
the blood glucose levels. Although the physiological process underlying this
particular application is characterized by strong non-linearities and low data
reliability, we show that it is possible to obtain meaningful results, in terms
of conditional probability learning and model ranking power.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity-like mechanisms dominate late acute rejection
episodes in renal allograft recipients.

Ode-Hakim S(1), Docke WD, Kern F, Emmrich F, Volk HD, Reinke P.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Medical Immunology, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.

Episodes of acute rejection (aRx) may occur in functional renal allografts even
at a very late stage post-Tx. Histopathology in early and late aRx looks quite
similar--however, there is a slower deterioration of graft function in late aRx, 
suggesting that pathogenetic immune mechanisms are different. In order to
investigate this phenomenon we studied the gene expression pattern (IL-1beta, 2, 
4, 8, 10, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, GrnA, IL-2R p55/p75) in PBMC and core biopsies from
long-term renal allograft recipients with histologically proven late aRx and
compared it with transplant and non-transplant controls using a semiquantitative 
RT-PCR technique. PBMC and graft-infiltrating cells of patients with late aRx
showed an upregulation, especially of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and TNFalpha
transcripts. While IL-2 mRNA was only detected in PBMC of two patients with late 
aRx who were not on cyclosporine, upregulation of intragraft IL-2 mRNA allowed
the best discrimination between aRx and the other groups (sensitivity: 83%,
specificity: 93%). In contrast to several reports on early Rx we did not notice
an elevation of granzyme A transcripts in comparison with the controls,
suggesting that cell-mediated inflammatory processes (CD4+ T cell-mediated DTH)
dominate the late aRx, while early aRx is characterized by the additional
involvement of cytotoxic T cell response. This may explain the distinct clinical 
course. Additionally, in a pilot study we successfully treated late aRx in 10/12 
patients with the anti-CD 4 mAb, 16H5. Our encouraging therapeutic results
underline the pathogenetic role of CD4+ T cells and support our hypothesis on
DTH-like mechanisms in late aRx.

A robust parametric estimator for single-trial movement related brain potentials.

Lange DH(1), Inbar GF.

Author information: 
(1)Electrical Engineering Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology,
Haifa. lange@tx.technion.ac.il

Current estimators for single-trial evoked potentials (EP's) require a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB or better to obtain high quality estimations,
yet many types of EP's suffer from substantially lower SNR's. This paper presents
a robust-evoked-potential-estimator (REPE) facilitating high quality estimations 
of single movement related EP's with a relatively low SNR. The estimator is based
on a standard ARX model, enhanced to support estimation under poor SNR
conditions. The REPE was tested successfully on a computer simulated data set
giving reliable single-trial estimations for the low SNR range of around -20 dB. 
THe REPE was also applied to experimental data, producing clear single-trial
estimations of movement related brain signals recorded in a classic scenario of
self-paced finger tapping experiment.

An efficient approach to ARMA modeling of biological systems with multiple inputs

Author information: 
(1)Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Division of Health Sciences and
Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA. perrott@mit.edu

This paper presents a new approach to AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA or ARX)
modeling which automatically seeks the best model order to represent investigated
linear, time invariant systems using their input/output data. The algorithm seeks
the ARMA parameterization which accounts for variability in the output of the
system due to input activity and contains the fewest number of parameters
required to do so. The unique characteristics of the proposed system
identification algorithm are its simplicity and efficiency in handling systems
with delays and multiple inputs. We present results of applying the algorithm to 
simulated data and experimental biological data In addition, a technique for
assessing the error associated with the impulse responses calculated from
estimated ARMA parameterizations is presented. The mapping from ARMA coefficients
to impulse response estimates is nonlinear, which complicates any effort to
construct confidence bounds for the obtained impulse responses. Here a method for
obtaining a linearization of this mapping is derived, which leads to a simple
procedure to approximate the confidence bounds.

The project we describe here is aimed at assisting out-patients affected by
Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus. Our approach exploits the usual scheme of
diabetic patients management, based on (i) a periodic evaluation of patients'
metabolic control performed by the physician, and (ii) patient-tailored tables
for self-adjustments of insulin dosages. Following this scheme we have defined a 
system built on a two-level architecture. The High Level Module exploits both
medical knowledge and clinical information in order to assess an insulin
protocol, defined in terms of insulin timing, type, and total amount. The High
Level Module exchanges information with the Low Level Module in order to define
the control actions to be taken at the low level, as well as to periodically
evaluate protocol adequacy on the basis of patient data. The goal of the Low
Level Module, whose characteristics can be adaptively modified by the High Level 
Module, is to suggest the next insulin dosage, depending on the actual blood
glucose measurement and a certain pre-defined insulin delivery protocol. The
Level Control Module is based on an adaptive controller, consisting of a Fuzzy
Set Controller and an ARX (Autoregressive eXogenous input) Model. The scheme here
presented may be conveniently viewed in a telemedicine context, in which the low 
level controller is implemented on a portable device communicating to the high
level controller, implemented on a remote computer. A preliminary assessment has 
been performed, analyzing a data set of 60 patients provided by the American
Association of Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
Subgroup, and the implementation of the system is currently in progress.

Sweep by sweep analysis of event-related potentials (ERP) of the human scalp
represents a reliable tool for both the diagnosis of neurologic diseases and the 
study of the central nervous system during cognitive tasks. The off-line
procedure based on stochastic parametric identification and filtering herewith
described, allows an accurate analysis of single-sweep ERP and a drastic
reduction of ocular artefacts variously propagating through the skull. Moreover, 
the spatial distribution of the recorded ERP in bidimensional form was enhanced
by using the Laplacian operator in order to get an estimate of the source current
density (SCD) flow from the skull into the scalp. Complete single-trial signals
were filtered according to an autoregressive model of signal generation with 2
exogenous inputs (ARX2). The ARX2 procedure models the recorded signal as the sum
of three signals: (a) the background EEG activity, modelled as an autoregressive 
process driven by a white noise; (b) a filtered version of a reference signal
carrying the average information contained in each sweep; (c) a signal due to the
ocular artefact propagation. The evaluation of the effect of artefact suppression
on those channels close to the eyes was compared with standard ordinary least
squares method (OLS) based on a linear model of the influence of EOG on ERP.
Finally, the better results obtainable through ARX filtering on sweep-by-sweep
brain mappings are also presented.

Sonic noise between 300 and 1600 Hz is introduced into the mouths of 11 healthy
adult male subjects at resting lung volume and is detected over the anterior
extrathoracic trachea and at three sites on the right posterior chest wall. To
overcome the difficulties associated with non-parametric phase unwrapping due to 
thoracic anti-resonances, the phase delay tau(f) of propagation between the
trachea and the chest wall is estimated using a linear parametric ARX-type
statistical model with the non-parametric magnitude spectra as a guide. The
resulting tau(f) estimates are unambiguous and reliable, and show a clear trend
of decreasing tau(f) with increasing frequency, indicating that sound at higher
frequencies reaches the chest wall faster than that at lower frequencies. This
finding indicates that respiratory sound transmission is highly dispersive, most 
probably owing to frequency-dependent airway and parenchymal wavespeeds.

Analysis of single trial movement-related brain macropotential.

Chiarenza GA(1), Cerutti S, Liberati D.

Author information: 
(1)Istituto di Neuropsichiatria Infantile, Università di Milano, Ospedale di Rho,
Italy.

A parametric method of identification of movement-related brain macropotentials
on a single trial basis through an ARX (autoregressive with exogenous inputs)
algorithm is presented. The basic estimation of the information contained in the 
single trial is taken from an average carried out on a sufficient number of
trials, while the noise sources, EEG and EOG are characterized as exogenous
inputs in the model. The simulations as well as the experimental results confirm 
the capability of the model to drastically improve the signal/noise ratio in each
single trial and to satisfactorily identify the contributions of signal and noise
in the overall recording. This way, using the same algorithm, a particularly
efficient reduction of ocular artifacts is also achieved. The movement-related
brain macropotentials recorded in three subjects show a high degree of
variability from trial and this effect seems to be related to programming
processes and evaluation of errors.

A technique of stochastic parametric identification and filtering is applied to
the analysis of single-sweep event-related potentials. This procedure, called
AutoRegressive with n eXogenous inputs (ARXn), models the recorded signal as the 
sum of n+1 signals: the background EEG activity, modeled as an autoregressive
process driven by white noise, and n signals, one of which represents a filtered 
version of a reference signal carrying the average information contained in each 
sweep. The other (n-1) signals could represent various sources of noise (i.e.,
artifacts, EOG, etc.). An evaluation of the effects of both artifact suppression 
and accurate selection of the average signal on mono- or multi-channel scalp
recordings is presented.

For many applications in biomedical engineering, and especially for precise
dosimetry in photodynamic therapy, it is essential to determine the absorption
and scattering of light in biological tissue very precisely. At present it is not
possible to measure the absorption and scattering coefficient separately by using
an endoscopic sensor based upon the backscattering phenomenon. In this paper, we 
propose a solution to this problem. We present a new model derived from Kubelka
and Munk's theory, which is known to be suitable for the description of optical
phenomena in tissue. Then we apply an algorithm often used in signal processing, 
the Auto Regressive with eXternal input or ARX model, which allows us to
determine both optical coefficients separately. A first validation is done by
numerical simulation, then measurements with phantoms were done. The results of
both tests prove the model to be reliable and effective.

Single-sweep visual evoked potential analysis would be useful in clinical
electrophysiology practice because it would make possible the evaluation of
transient phenomena, but recording single-sweep visual evoked potentials is
difficult because of the low signal-noise ratio. To increase this ratio we used a
filter based on an autoregressive with exogenous input model. We studied a group 
of 12 diabetic patients matched with a control group of 14 normal subjects. The
model, in most cases, allowed us to extrapolate the P100 component from each
single sweep of visual evoked potential. The visual evoked potential values
obtained by means of averaging were not significantly different in the groups
studied, but single-sweep analysis showed different distribution of the P100
component amplitude. The preliminary results of our study evidenced differences
in the amplitude and latency distribution of normal and diabetic subjects, thus
confirming the power of this new technique and its ability to obtain some
information that is masked by the averaging method.

Adaptive buffering of breath-by-breath variations of end-tidal CO2 of humans.

We have designed and implemented a computer-controlled system that uses an
adaptive control algorithm (generalized minimum variance) to buffer the
breath-by-breath variations of the end-tidal CO2 fraction (FETCO2) that occur
spontaneously or are exaggerated in certain experimental protocols (e.g., induced
hypoxia, any type of induced variations in the ventilatory pattern). Near the end
of each breath, FETCO2 of the following breath is predicted and the inspired CO2 
fraction (FICO2) of the upcoming breath is adjusted to minimize the difference
between the predicted and desired FETCO2 of the next breath. The one-breath-ahead
prediction of FETCO2 is based on an adaptive autoregressive with exogenous inputs
(ARX) model: FETCO2 of a given breath is related to FICO2, FETCO2 of the previous
breath, and inspiratory ventilation. Adequacy of the prediction is demonstrated
using data from experiments in which FICO2 was varied pseudorandomly in
wakefulness and sleep. The algorithm for optimally buffering changes in FETCO2 is
based on the coefficients of the ARX model. We have determined experimentally the
frequency of FETCO2 variations that can be buffered adequately by our controller,
testing both spontaneous variations in FETCO2 and variations induced by hypoxia
in young awake human subjects. The controller is most effective in buffering
variations of FETCO2 in the frequency range of <0.1 cycle/breath. Some potential 
applications are discussed.

[The "Lifecare Concept" of "ecological cancer prevention". Report No. 29].

[Article in German]

Hauser SP(1), Deplazes G.

Author information: 
(1)Schweizerische Krebsliga, Bern.

The Lifecare concept of ecological cancer prevention is summarized in the
Lifecare Fitness Checkup and contains: Lifecare questionnaire, Lifecare age test 
using Vincent's bioelectronic method. Lifecare reform programme according to
Kousmine and a whole food, fresh fruit and vegetable diet in accordance with the 
nutritional pyramid, personal health counselling based on the Lifecare philosophy
and ecological holistic medicine. Subjects are tested and supervised by a
Lifecare doctor who has been admitted to the Lifecare Association. Only the
prophylactic Lifecare testing and supervising would require roughly one physician
per 1000 subjects. In 1982, the equipment costs were DM 13,000.- and the test DM 
150.-. The Lifecare Association was founded as a non-profit organization in 1986 
with its headquarters in Zurich. Mrs. T. Büchi-von Arx is the initiator of the
Lifecare Association, Dr. Lietha is founding president, and the current president
is Dr. M. Vogel, Lugano. The main promotors are named as Dr. h.c. A. Vogel and
Bioforce Ltd. The association promotes a Lifecare philosophy on the basis of
ecological holistic medicine, which itself is based on the terrain theory. It is 
maintained that the cause of degenerative diseases such as cancer and rheumatism 
is an alteration in the terrain brought about by over-acidification of the tissue
resulting from metabolic disturbances. Vincent's bioelectronic test supposedly
enables changes in the terrain to be detected even before the subject becomes
manifestly ill. The aim is to exclude ecological toxins. Apparently the terrain
can be normalized by a diet rich in vital substances. No scientific
investigations are available on the hypothetical Lifecare concept of ecological
cancer prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Parametric classification of segments in ocular nystagmus.

Rey CG(1), Galiana HL.

Author information: 
(1)Biomedical Engineering Unit, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal,
P.Q., Canada.

A new method for nystagmus classification, using system identification
techniques, is presented. We formulate a system whose input is head position and 
whose output is eye position. We approximate this system with an autoregressive
with exogenous input (ARX) model which relates the input and output (transfer
function) regardless of the temporal profile for the sensory stimulation. The
system is then identified using a least squares criteria and three indicators are
produced. From these a flag is produced that marks slow and fast phases as well
as blinks and bad data segments. Tests with simulated and real data are presented
and indicate that the segment classification is remarkably insensitive to
recording noise and that it is more robust than previous techniques. Operator
intervention is minimal. We expect the method to be applicable for all types of
ocular nystagmus. Here, however, we illustrate our results only in the context of
the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). A discussion explains how this method can also 
be applied for optokinetic (OKN) or pursuit nystagmus.

Rules of molecular geometry for predicting carcinogenic activity of unsubstituted
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.

Flesher JW(1), Myers SR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Albert B. Chandler Medical Center, University of
Kentucky, Lexington 40536.

The rules of molecular geometry for predicting carcinogenic activity of
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) have been applied to a series of 50
unsubstituted PAH, and predicted carcinogenic activity is in good agreement with 
the results of testing for complete carcinogenic activity in mice and/or rats.
The rules were developed from a knowledge of the center or centers of highest
chemical or biochemical reactivity and are consistent with a unified hypothesis
which states that the first step in the metabolic activation of unsubstituted PAH
is the biochemical introduction of a methyl group. This bioalkylation reaction 1)
takes place between certain PAH and S-adenosyl-L-methionine and is catalyzed by
cytosolic methyltransferase, 2) offers a means of probing for centers of
reactivity in PAH, 3) provides a biochemical link between unsubstituted
preprocarcinogens of aromatic type ArX and alkyl-substituted procarcinogens of
aromatic type ArCH2X (where X = H), and 4) makes it possible to include compounds
of both aromatic types, in a consistent theory of aromatic hydrocarbon activation
which incorporates alkyl substitution. The present study reveals that there are
structural determinants of carcinogenicity.

The implementation of an autoregressive model with exogenous input in a single
sweep visual evoked potential analysis.

Liberati D(1), Cerutti S, Di Ponzio E, Ventimiglia V, Zaninelli L.

Author information: 
(1)CNR, Centro Teoria dei Sistemi, Milano, Italy.

Based on a model of signal-noise interaction, we present a method for
single-sweep analysis of Visual Evoked Potentials. The EEG is represented as an
autoregressive process and the single-sweep VEP as a filtered version of a
reference signal taken as the running average of 20 consecutive sweeps. The
algorithm for model identification and filtering is an ARX (AutoRegressive with
eXogenous input) which provides a fast and efficient solution by means of a least
squares approach. The choice of reference signal, as well as the complexity of
the model, is also discussed. A further advantage of this approach is parameter
reduction: all the single-sweep information is contained in 18 model coefficients
and the reference signal.

Author information:

Laval, Québec, Canada.

The distribution of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) binding sites was
investigated in the central nervous system of the frog Rana ridibunda using the
technique of in vitro receptor autoradiography by means of [125I]-labeled ANF-28.
The anatomic distribution of ANF recognition sites was determined on Kodak ARX
films apposed onto tissue sections, and their distribution was examined in
greater detail by analysis of autoradiograms generated by using emulsion-coated
sections. The highest levels of ANF binding sites were found in the olfactory
bulb, the dorsal pallium, the septum, the habenular nucleus, the dorsal
infundibular nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, and in the tectum. Moderate
levels of ANF binding sites were observed in the thalamus and throughout the
mesencephalon, whereas low levels were detected in the lateral and medial
pallium, the medial forebrain bundle, and the nucleus rotondus. In the pituitary 
gland, the neural and distal lobes were densely loaded with ANF binding sites,
whereas no autoradiographic labeling was observed in the pars intermedia. In
general, there was a good correlation between the location of ANF receptors and
the distribution of ANF-containing neurons, as previously determined by
immunocytochemistry. Together these results support the view that ANF may act as 
a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator in various regions of the frog brain.

Single sweep analysis of visual evoked potentials through a model of parametric
identification.

Cerutti S, Baselli G, Liberati D, Pavesi G.

An original method is presented for the single sweep analysis of visual evoked
potentials (VEP's). The introduced algorithm bases upon an AutoRegressive with
eXogenous input (ARX) modeling. A Least Squares procedure estimates the
coefficients of the model and allows to obtain a complete black-box description
of the signal generation mechanism, besides providing a filtered version of the
single sweep potential. The performance of the algorithm is verified on proper
simulation tests and the experimental results put into evidence the noticeable
improvement of signal-to-noise ratio with a consequent better recognition of the 
classical parameters of the peaks (latencies and amplitudes). The possibility of 
measuring these parameters on a single sweep basis enables to evaluate the
dynamics of the Central Nervous System response during the entire course of the
examination. A classification of the estimated evoked potentials in a small
number of subsets, on the basis of their morphology, is also possible.

Morphologic and physiologic studies of three dematiaceous pathogens.

Dixon DM, Salkin IF.

Uncertainty in identifying a dematiaceous mold from a human bronchial washing
precipitated a study of Dactylaria gallopava (Cooke) Bhatt et Kendrick and its
relationship to Scolecobasidium constrictum Abbott. Morphologic and physiologic
studies were conducted with representative isolates and subcultures derived from 
the isolates used to prepare the type specimens of these two fungi, as well as a 
third dark mold, Ochroconis constricta (Abbott) de Hoog et von Arx. All test
isolates were morphologically similar in that two-celled, cylindrical
blastoconidia with a rhexolytic mode of dehiscence were the predominant and most 
consistent anamorphic structures. Sympodial development of the conidiophore was
too variable to distinguish the isolates. Based on their morphologic similarity, 
we propose a new combination within the genus Dactylaria as amended by Bhatt and 
Kendrick, D. constricta (Abbott) Dixon et Salkin. However, D. constricta could be
differentiated into two groups on the basis of physiologic tests--a subgroup in
which isolates grow at 37 and 45 degrees C, give a delayed positive gelatin
reaction, and are inhibited on Mycosel agar; and a second subgroup in which
isolates grow on Mycosel agar and give a rapid positive gelatin reaction, but do 
not grow at 37 or 45 degrees C. We recommend that D. constricta be viewed as a
potential pathogen when isolated from clinical specimens.

Release of hyaluronidase and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase during in vitro
incubation of hamster sperm.

Zao PZ, Meizel S, Talbot P.

Previous studies have shown that hamster sperm release a significant amount of
hyaluronidase before and independently of the normal acrosome reaction. In this
study, we have used improved methods for in vitro incubation to investigate the
time course of the release of hyaluronidase and hexosaminidase from hamster
sperm. When hamster sperm are incubated in medium which allows capacitation, 34
to 47% of the total mechanically extractable hyaluronidase and 34 to 51% of
beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase are released into solution prior to and independently
of the normal acrosome reaction (ARx). An additional 40 to 50% of the
hyaluronidase and 34 to 51% of the hexosaminidase are released at the time of the
normal ARx. Control experiments indicate that the early release is not due to the
presence of dead sperm in culture and that the normal ARx is required for the
second release. Increasing amounts of TCA-precipitated bovine serum albumin in
the culture medium stimulated the early (1 hr) release of both enzymes. The data 
are consistent with the ideas that a significant amount of both enzymes is
released from the sperm surface by 1 hr of incubation and that about the same
amount of each enzyme is released during the normal ARx. Hyaluronidase and
hexosaminidase release at the time of the acrosome reaction was measured for the 
first time using hamster sperm. The biphasic release of these enzymes may
indicate that they have a dual function in fertilization and may help explain how
sperm can penetrate the cumulus and corona radiata without undergoing an acrosome
reaction.

The effect of foliar application of 2% urea and 0.6% benomyl on changes in
colonization of the rhizosphere by microorganisms and of roots by the fungus
Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) Arx et Olivier var. tritici Walker was followed
in vegetation glass-house experiments. Treatment with a urea solution resulted in
increased counts of bacteria (82%), Pseudomonas fluorescens (46%), Agrobacterium 
sp. (31%) and antagonistic bacteria with respect to the used fungus isolate and
in a decreased occurrence of micromycetes (63%). Treatment of wheat with a
benomyl solution resulted in an increased count of bacteria (43%) and a decreased
occurrence of P. fluorescens (16%), Agrobacterium sp. (50%) and fungi (67%).
After treatment with both compounds the infection of roots by G. graminis
considerably decreased as compared with untreated plants. The results are
discussed from the point of view of the effect of application of the studied
compounds to upper parts of wheat on the microflora colonizing its roots.

[Planimetric analysis of ventricular depolarization on Frank's corrected

loading].

[Article in Bulgarian]

Shakhov B, Urumov G.

Nineteen planimetric indices of 110 cardiac healthy subjects, 141 patient with
left ventricle loading and 136 patients with right ventricle loading are
analyzed. On the base of the variation analysis and determination of
statistically significant differences, it was established that in
right-ventricular loading the following indices deviate from the norm: ASX, AQZ, 
AQRSX, AQRSz, SAQRSx, SAQRSy, SAQRSz, SAS, SAQRSg, whereas in left-ventricular
loading -- ARx, ARz, AQRSx, AQRSz, SAQRx, SAQRSy, SAQRz, SAR, SAQRSg. At a second
stage, the sensitivity of the separate indices from the groups with left
ventricular and right-ventricular loading was amalyzed, as well as the separate
subgroups (pulmonary stenosis, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, interauricular
defect, arterial hypertension, mitral or aortic insufficiency. The results were
compared with those of axial indices, obtained from another investigation of the 
authors. The planimetric analysis was established to be more complex than the
axial and the index SAQRSg to be with the best sensitivity in the cases with
hemodynamically lightly loaded musculature.

Roots of wheat grown in unsterilized sand inoculated withGaeumannomyces graminis 
(Sacc.) von Arx and Olivier were examined by scanning electron microscopy.
Healthy roots had a mucilaginous covering and were sparsely colonized by
bacteria, but asG. graminis colonized the roots the mucilage disappeared and the 
numbers of bacteria on the surface increased. Lysis of the hyphae occurred,
apparently caused by bacteria that colonized the hyphae. Inoculation of wheat in 
axenic culture with a strain ofPseudomonas fluorescens that was antagonistic toG.
graminis in agar gave some protection against the pathogen; lysis of hyphae was
observed where protection occurred.

A volatile factor inducing transmissible lysis in Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.)

Sivasithamparam K, Stukely M, Parker CA.

Filtered water extract of Gabalong soil with a recent history of take-all in

Bdellovibrio on plate seeded with bacteria. However, there was no evidence of the
presence of bacteria, viruses, or mycoplasmas. The lytic factor was transmissible
in culture filtrates to fresh subcultures of the fungus. Exposure of young
healthy colonies to sublethal doses of ultraviolet light also induced
transmissible lysis. The lytic factor was heat-stable, passed through a 25-nm
filter, and was not affected by nuclease (enzymes) or severe irradiation with UV 
light. It also induced bysis in several other strains of G. graminis. Lysis was
always preceded by a growth-stimulatory effect on the fungus. The lytic factor
was active as a volatile chemical which induced transmissible lysis and continued
to be formed, apparently as a self-perpetuating agent, in lysing cultures of the 
fungus.
