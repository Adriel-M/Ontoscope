BACKGROUND: Activation of mast cells through FceRI plays an important role in
acute allergic reactions. However, little is known about the function of mast
cells in patients with chronic allergic inflammation or the effect of repeated
FceRI triggering occurring in such responses.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify changes in mast cell function after repeated
FceRI triggering and to correlate these changes to chronic allergic responses in 
tissue.
METHODS: Human cord blood-derived mast cells were treated for 2 weeks with
anti-IgE. The function of naive or treated mast cells was analyzed by means of
RNA sequencing, quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional assays.
Protein secretion was measured with ELISAs and multiplex assays.
RESULTS: We observed several changes in mast cell function after repeated
anti-IgE triggering. Although the acute response was dampened, we identified 289 
genes significantly upregulated after repeated anti-IgE. Most of these genes
(84%) were not upregulated after a single anti-IgE stimulus, indicating a
significantly different response mode characterized by increased antigen
presentation, response to bacteria, and chemotaxis. Changes in mast cell function
were related to changes in expression of the transcription factors RXRA and BATF 
and others. Importantly, we found a substantial overlap between genes upregulated
after repeated anti-IgE triggering and genes upregulated in tissue from patients 
with chronic allergy, in particular those of patients with chronic
rhinosinusitis.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence for intrinsic modulation of mast cell
function on repeated FceRI-mediated activation. The overlap with gene expression 
in tissues is suggestive of a direct link between repeated IgE-mediated
activation of mast cells and chronic allergy.

<U+03B3>d T lymphocytes are programmed into distinct IFN-<U+03B3>-producing CD27(+) (<U+03B3>d27(+))
and IL-17-producing CD27(-) (<U+03B3>d27(-)) subsets that play key roles in protective
or pathogenic immune responses. Although the signature cytokines are shared with 
their aß Th1 (for <U+03B3>d27(+)) and Th17 (for <U+03B3>d27(-)) cell counterparts, we dissect
in this study similarities and differences in the transcriptional requirements of
murine effector <U+03B3>d27(+), <U+03B3>d27(-)CCR6(-), and <U+03B3>d27(-)CCR6(+) <U+03B3>d T cell subsets and
aß T cells. We found they share dependence on the master transcription factors
T-bet and ROR<U+03B3>t for IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-17 production, respectively. However, Eomes is
fully dispensable for IFN-<U+03B3> production by <U+03B3>d T cells. Furthermore, the Th17 cell 
auxiliary transcription factors RORa and BATF are not required for IL-17
production by <U+03B3>d27(-) cell subsets. We also show that <U+03B3>d27(-) (but not <U+03B3>d27(+))
cells become polyfunctional upon IL-1ß plus IL-23 stimulation, cosecreting
IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, GM-CSF, and IFN-<U+03B3>. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo 
data firmly establish the molecular segregation between <U+03B3>d27(+) and <U+03B3>d27(-) T
cell subsets and provide novel insight on the nonoverlapping transcriptional
networks that control the differentiation of effector <U+03B3>d versus aß T cell
subsets.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that
regulates gene expression in many cell types, including immune cells. It requires
binding of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D3) for activation. Many autoimmune
diseases show latitude-dependent prevalence and/or association with vitamin D
deficiency, and vitamin D supplementation is commonly used in their clinical
management. 1,25D3 is regulated by genes associated with the risk of autoimmune
diseases and predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. We determined the VDR
cistrome in monocytes and monocyte-derived inflammatory (DC1) and tolerogenic
dendritic cells (DC2). VDR motifs were highly overrepresented in ChIP-Seq peaks
in stimulated monocyte (40%), DC1 (21%) and DC2 (47%), P<E(-100) for all. Of the 
nearly 11<U+2009>000 VDR-binding peaks identified across the genome in DC1s, 1317 were
shared with DC2s (91% of DC2 sites) and 1579 with monocytes (83% of monocyte
sites). Latitude-dependent autoimmune disease risk polymorphisms were highly
overrepresented within 5<U+2009>kb of the peaks. Several transcription factor
recognition motifs were highly overrepresented in the peaks, including those for 
the autoimmune risk gene, BATF. This evidence indicates that VDR regulates
hundreds of myeloid cell genes and that the molecular pathways controlled by VDR 
in these cells are important in maintaining tolerance.Genes and Immunity advance

The transcription factor BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor,
ATF-like), belongs to the AP-1 family of transcription factors and has been shown
to be predominantly expressed in cells of haematopoietic origin, especially in B 
and T cells. In studies using Batf-deficient mice, a profound defect in the
differentiation of T helper cells type 17 (Th17) and follicular T helper cells
(Tfh) was described, as well as an impairment of antibody production with
switched isotypes. More recently BATF has been described to influence also Th2
and Th9 responses in models of murine experimental asthma. In CD8(+) T cells BATF
has been found associated with anti-viral responses. This review summarizes the
role of BATF in CD4(+) T cell subsets and in CD8(+) T cells, with particular
focus on this transcription factor in the setting of allergic asthma.

of Anti-Major Histocompatibility Complex-Induced Obliterative Airway Disease.

Antibodies (Abs) against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) results in T
helper-17 (Th17)-mediated immunity against lung self-antigens (SAgs), K-a1
tubulin and collagen V and obliterative airway disease (OAD). Because B
cell-activating transcription factor (BATF) controls Th17 and autoimmunity, we
proposed that BATF may play a critical role in OAD. Anti-H2K(b) was administered 
intrabronchially into Batf (-/-) and C57BL/6 mice. Histopathology of the lungs on
days 30 and 45 after Ab administration to Batf (-/-) mice resulted in decreased
cellular infiltration, epithelial metaplasia, fibrosis, and obstruction. There
was lack of Abs to SAgs, reduction of Sag-specific interleukin (IL)-17 T cells,
IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-1ß, fibroblast growth factor-6, and CXCL12 and decreased
Janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and
retinoid-related orphan receptor <U+03B3>T. Further, micro-RNA (miR)-301a, a regulator
of Th17, was reduced in Batf (-/-) mice in contrast to upregulation of miR-301a
and downregulation of protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) in
anti-MHC-induced OAD animals. We also demonstrate an increase in miR-301a in the 
bronchoalveolar lavage cells from lung transplant recipients with Abs to human
leukocyte antigen. This was accompanied by reduction in PIAS3 mRNA. Therefore, we
conclude that BATF plays a critical role in the immune responses to SAgs and
pathogenesis of anti-MHC-induced rejection. Targeting BATF should be considered
for preventing chronic rejection after human lung transplantation.

CD99 signaling is crucial to a diverse range of biological functions including
survival and proliferation. CD99 engagement is reported to augment activator
protein-1 (AP-1) activity through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways
in a T-lymphoblastic lymphoma cell line Jurkat and in breast cancer cell lines.
In this study, we report that CD99 differentially regulated AP-1 activity in the 
human myeloma cell line RPMI8226. CD99 was highly expressed and the CD99
engagement led to activation of the MAP kinases, but suppressed AP-1 activity by 
inducing the expression of basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like
(BATF), a negative regulator of AP-1 in RPMI8226 cells. By contrast, engagement
of CD99 enhanced AP-1 activity and did not change the BATF expression in Jurkat
cells. CD99 engagement reduced the proliferation of RPMI8226 cells and expression
of cyclin 1 and 3. Overall, these results suggest novel CD99 functions in
RPMI8226 cells.

Control of chronic viral infections by CD8 T cells is critically dependent on CD4
help. In particular, helper-derived IL-21 plays a key role in sustaining the CD8 
T cell response; however, the molecular pathways by which IL-21 sustains CD8 T
cell immunity remain unclear. We demonstrate that IL-21 causes a phenotypic
switch of transcription factor expression in CD8 T cells during chronic viral
infection characterized by sustained BATF expression. Importantly, BATF
expression during chronic infection is both required for optimal CD8 T cell
persistence and anti-viral effector function and sufficient to rescue "unhelped" 
CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, BATF sustains the response by cooperating with
IRF4, an antigen-induced transcription factor that is also critically required
for CD8 T cell maintenance, to preserve Blimp-1 expression and thereby sustain
CD8 T cell effector function. Collectively, these data suggest that CD4 T cells
"help" the CD8 response during chronic infection via IL-21-induced BATF
expression.

Interleukin 17-producing helper T (Th17) cells have been widely defined by the
lineage transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)<U+03B3>t.
Pathophysiologically, these cells play a crucial role in autoimmune diseases and 
have been linked to dysregulated germinal center (GC) reactions and autoantibody 
production. In this study, we used gene expression and flow cytometric analyses
for the characterization of Ror<U+03B3>t(-/-) and Ror<U+03B3>t(-/-)Il21(RFP/+) mice to
demonstrate a previously unknown transcriptional flexibility in the development
of IL-17-producing Th-cell subsets. We found an accumulation of follicular Th
(Tfh) cells by 5.2-fold, spontaneous 13-fold higher GC formation, decreased
frequency of follicular Foxp3(+) T-regulatory (Treg) cells (50%), and a 3.4-fold 
increase in the number of proliferating follicular B cells in ROR<U+03B3>t-deficient vs.
wild-type mice. Dysregulated B-cell responses were associated with enhanced
production of IL-17 (6.4-fold), IL-21 (2.2-fold), and B-cell-activating factor
(BAFF) (2-fold) and were partially rescued by adoptive transfer of Treg cells. In
an unexpected finding, we detected ROR<U+03B3>t-independent IL-17 expression in
ICOS(+)CXCR5(+)Tfh and in ICOS(+)CXCR5(-)Th cells. Based on the observed high
Irf4 and Batf gene expression, we suggest that CD4(+) T-cell transcription
factors other than ROR<U+03B3>t can cooperatively induce differentiation of
IL-17-producing Th cells, including Th17-like Tfh-cell subsets. We conclude that 
the occurrence of aberrant Tfh and follicular Treg cells support spontaneous GC
formation and dysregulated B-cell responses in ROR<U+03B3>t-deficient mice.-Wichner, K.,

[B Cell Activating Transcription Factor Regulates Acute Airway Inflammation in
Asthmatic Mice].

[Article in Chinese]

Yuan Shu-li, Zhong P, Fan XM, Huang CL, Wang WJ, Zhan XQ, He XP.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulatory effect of B cell activating
transcription factor (BATF) on acute airway inflammation and its association with
retinoic acid orphan nuclear receptors gammat (RORyt) in asthmatic mice.
METHODS: 24 female BALB/c mice were randomly and equally divided into three
groups (n 8): normal saline (NS) treated, asthma (AS) control and dexamethasone
(DEX) treated. AS mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA to establish
murine asthma model. Histological changes in lung tissues of the mice were
observed by HE staining. Numbers of white blood cell (WBC), polymorphonuclear
leukocyte (PMN) and eosinophils (EOS) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 
of the mice were counted. The concentration of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in BALF was
measured by ELISA. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to assess
the mRNA expressions of BATF, IL-17 and ROR<U+03B3>t in the lung tissues.
RESULTS: The HE staining showed a higher level of inflammatory cell infiltration 
around the bronchi of AS mice compared with those treated with NS, predominantly 
in the forms of EOS, PMN and lymphocytes. The AS and DEX treated mice had higher 
levels of EOS, PMN, WBC and mRNA expressions of BATF, IL-17 and ROR<U+03B3>t in BALF
than those treated with NS (P < 0.05). DEX reduced the levels of EOS, PMN, WBC
and IL-17 in BALF significantly (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of BATF in lung
tissues of mice was positively correlated with the expression of IL-17, ROR<U+03B3>t and
the counts of WBC,EOS and PMN in BALF (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Asthmatic mice have increased expressions of BATF, IL-17 and ROR<U+03B3>t in
bronchial and lung tissues. BATF can, through regulating the secretion of Th17
cells, readjust the airway inflammatory. The regulatory function may take effect 
through synergy with ROR<U+03B3>t .

BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the CD56(dim)CD16(+) subset of Natural Killer (NK)
cells has been thought to mediate cellular cytotoxicity with modest cytokine
secretion capacity. However, studies have suggested that this subset may exert a 
more diverse array of immunological functions. There exists a lack of
well-developed functional models to describe the behavior of activated NK cells, 
and the interactions between signaling pathways that facilitate effector
functions are not well understood. In the present study, a combination of
genome-wide microarray analyses and systems-level bioinformatics approaches were 
utilized to elucidate the transcriptional landscape of NK cells activated via
interactions with antibody-coated targets in the presence of interleukin-12
(IL-12).
METHODS: We conducted differential gene expression analysis of CD56(dim)CD16(+)
NK cells following FcR stimulation in the presence or absence of IL-12. Next, we 
functionally characterized gene sets according to patterns of gene expression and
validated representative genes using RT-PCR. IPA was utilized for biological
pathway analysis, and an enriched network of interacting genes was generated
using GeneMANIA. Furthermore, PAJEK and the HITS algorithm were employed to
identify important genes in the network according to betweeness centrality, hub, 
and authority node metrics.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed that CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells co-stimulated via the
Fc receptor (FcR) and IL-12R led to the expression of a unique set of genes,
including genes encoding cytotoxicity receptors, apoptotic proteins,
intracellular signaling molecules, and cytokines that may mediate enhanced
cytotoxicity and interactions with other immune cells within inflammatory
tissues. Network analyses identified a novel set of connected key players, BATF, 
IRF4, TBX21, and IFNG, within an integrated network composed of differentially
expressed genes in NK cells stimulated by various conditions (immobilized IgG,
IL-12, or the combination of IgG and IL-12).
CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to address the global mechanisms by
which NK cells mediate their biological functions when encountering

identified a set of high-priority targets for subsequent investigation into
strategies to combat cancer by enhancing the anti-tumor activity of

The family members Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 belong to a class of transcription
factors containing basic leucine zipper domains that regulate various
immunological functions and control the development and differentiation of immune
cells. Functional studies by others demonstrated a predominant role for Batf in
controlling Th2 cell functions and lineage development of T lymphocytes as well
as a critical role of Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 in CD8a+dendritic cell development.
Moreover, Batf family member expression was measured in a vast collection of
mouse and human cell types by cap analysis gene expression (CAGE), a recent
developed sequencing technology, showing reasonable expression spectrum in immune
cells consistent with previously published expression profiles. Batf and Batf3
were highly expressed in lymphocytes and the earlier moderately expressed in
myeloid lineages. Batf2 was predominantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages.
Functional studies in mice demonstrated that Batf2 has a central role in
macrophage activation by regulating inflammatory responses during
lipopolysaccharides stimulation and mycobacterial infection. Hence, Batf2 could
be used as a biomarker and a potential host directed drug target in tuberculosis.
Moreover, Batf2 act as a tumor suppressor gene and augmenting Batf2 in malignant 
cells might be an encouraging therapeutic treatment against cancer.

Invariant NKT (iNKT) cell thymic development can lead to distinct committed
effector lineages, namely NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17. However, following
identification of IL-9-producing iNKT cells involved in mucosal inflammation,
their development remains unaddressed. In this study, we report that although
thymic iNKT cells from naive mice do not express IL-9, iNKT cell activation in
the presence of TGF-ß and IL-4 induces IL-9 secretion in murine and human iNKT
cells. Acquisition of IL-9 production was observed in different iNKT subsets
defined by CD4, NK1.1, and neuropilin-1, indicating that distinct functional
subpopulations are receptive to IL-9 polarization. Transcription factor
expression kinetics suggest that regulatory mechanisms of IL-9 expression are
shared by iNKT and CD4 T cells, with Irf4 and Batf deficiency deeply affecting
IL-9 production. Importantly, adoptive transfer of an enriched IL-9(+) iNKT cell 
population leads to exacerbated allergic inflammation in the airways upon
intranasal immunization with house dust mite, confirming the ability of
IL-9-producing iNKT cells to mediate proinflammatory effects in vivo, as
previously reported. Taken together, our data show that peripheral iNKT cells
retain the capacity of shaping their function in response to environmental cues, 
namely TGF-ß and IL-4, adopting an IL-9-producing NKT cell phenotype able to
mediate proinflammatory effects in vivo, namely granulocyte and mast cell
recruitment to the lungs.

Apart from T helper (Th)-2 cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a major
class of IL-4-producing T cells, required for regulation of type 2 humoral
immunity; however, transcriptional control of IL-4 production in Tfh cells
remains mainly unknown. Here, we show that the basic leucine zipper transcription
factor ATF-like, Batf is important for IL-4 expression in Tfh cells rather than
in canonical Th2 cells. Functionally, Batf in cooperation with interferon
regulatory factor (IRF) 4 along with Stat3 and Stat6 trigger IL-4 production in
Tfh cells by directly binding to and activation of the CNS2 region in the IL-4
locus. In addition, Batf-to-c-Maf signalling is an important determinant of IL-4 
expression in Tfh cells. Batf deficiency impairs the generation of IL-4-producing
Tfh cells that results in protection against allergic asthma. Our results thus
indicate a positive role of Batf in promoting the generation of pro-allergic
IL-4-producing Tfh cells.

The immunoregulatory functions of vitamin D have been well documented in various 
immunological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and asthma.
IL-10 is considered a chief effector molecule that promotes the vitamin D-induced
immunosuppressive states of T cells and accessory cells. In this article, we
demonstrate that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(calcitriol), has a profound inhibitory effect on the development of human Th9, a
CD4 T cell subset that is highly associated with asthma, in an IL-10-independent 
manner. Our data show that calcitriol represses the expression of BATF, a
transcription factor essential for Th9, via suppressing the expression of aryl
hydrocarbon receptor, without an increase in IL-10. The data show a novel link
between vitamin D and two key transcription factors involved in T cell
differentiation.

The role and different origin of brain myeloid cells in the brain is central to
understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) responds to injury. C-type
lectin receptor family 9, member A (DNGR-1/CLEC9A) is a marker of specific DC
subsets that share functional similarities, such as CD8a(+) DCs in lymphoid
tissues and CD103(+) CD11b(low) DCs in peripheral tissues. Here, we analyzed the 
presence of DNGR-1 in DCs present in the mouse brain (bDCs). Dngr-1/Clec9a mRNA
is expressed mainly in the meningeal membranes and choroid plexus (m/Ch), and its
expression is enhanced by fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), a cytokine
involved in DC homeostasis. Using Clec9a(egfp/egfp) mice, we show that Flt3L
induces accumulation of DNGR-1-EGFP(+) cells in the brain m/Ch. Most of these
cells also express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules.
We also observed an increase in specific markers of cDC CD8a+ cells such as
Batf-3 and Irf-8, but not of costimulatory molecules such as Cd80 and Cd86,
indicating an immature phenotype for these bDCs in the noninjured brain. The
presence of DNGR-1 in the brain provides a potential marker for the study of this
specific brain cell subset. Knowledge and targeting of brain antigen presenting
cells (APCs) has implications for the fight against brain diseases such as
neuroinflammation-based neurodegenerative diseases, microbe-induced encephalitis,
and brain tumors such as gliomas.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of BATF, a member of the activator
protein-1 family, in the renal tissues of mice with lupus nephritis.
METHODS: The renal tissues from 24-week-old female MRL/lpr mice and age- and
sex-matched C57BL/6 mice were examined for BATF protein expressions using Western
blotting and for expressions of BATF, ROR<U+03B3>t and IL-17A mRNA using quantitative
real-time PCR. The results of laboratory examinations were analyzed in relation
with the histopathology of the mice.
RESULTS: The urinary protein and ds-DNA levels were significantly higher in
MRL/lpr mice than in the control mice (P<0.05). Compared to normal control mice, 
MRL/lpr mice showed obvious glomerular fibrosis and inflammatory cell
infiltrating with significantly increased BATF protein and mRNA expressions
(P<0.05) and ROR<U+03B3>t and IL-17 mRNA expressions in the renal tissues (P<0.05). In
MRL/lpr mice, the expression of BATF mRNA was positively correlated with the
ROR<U+03B3>t and IL-17A mRNA expressions in the renal tissues.
CONCLUSION: The renal expressions of BATF protein and mRNA is increased in
MRL/lpr mice. BATF may participate in the immunopathogenesis of lupus nephritis
by enhancing Thl7 cell response.

T-cell exhaustion was originally identified during chronic infection in mice, and
was subsequently observed in humans with cancer. The exhausted T cells in the
tumor microenvironment show overexpressed inhibitory receptors, decreased
effector cytokine production and cytolytic activity, leading to the failure of
cancer elimination. Restoring exhausted T cells represents an inspiring strategy 
for cancer treatment, which has yielded promising results and become a
significant breakthrough in the cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we overview
the updated understanding on the exhausted T cells in cancer and their potential 
regulatory mechanisms and discuss current therapeutic interventions targeting
exhausted T cells in clinical trials.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancies, as well as lymphoblastoid cell 
lines (LCLs), obtained in vitro by EBV infection of B cells, express latent viral
proteins and maintain their ability to grow indefinitely through inappropriate
activation of telomere-specific reverse transcriptase (TERT), the catalytic
component of telomerase. Our previous studies demonstrated that high levels of
TERT expression in LCLs prevent the activation of EBV lytic cycle, which is
instead triggered by TERT silencing. As lytic infection promotes the death of
EBV-positive tumor cells, understanding the mechanism(s) by which TERT affects
the latent/lytic status of EBV may be important for setting new therapeutic
strategies. BATF, a transcription factor activated by NOTCH2, the major NOTCH
family member in B cells, negatively affects the expression of BZLF1, the master 
regulator of viral lytic cycle. We therefore analyzed the interplay between TERT,
NOTCH and BATF in LCLs and found that high levels of endogenous TERT are
associated with high NOTCH2 and BATF expression levels. In addition, ectopic
expression of TERT in LCLs with low levels of endogenous telomerase was
associated with upregulation of NOTCH2 and BATF at both mRNA and protein levels. 
By contrast, infection of LCLs with retroviral vectors expressing functional
NOTCH2 did not alter TERT transcript levels. Luciferase reporter assays,
demonstrated that TERT significantly activated NOTCH2 promoter in a
dose-dependent manner. We also found that NF-<U+03BA>B pathway is involved in
TERT-induced NOTCH2 activation. Lastly, pharmacologic inhibition of NOTCH
signaling triggers the EBV lytic cycle, leading to the death of EBV-infected
cells. Overall, these results indicate that TERT contributes to preserve EBV
latency in B cells mainly through the NOTCH2/BAFT pathway, and suggest that
NOTCH2 inhibition may represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against
EBV-associated malignancies.

Basic leucine zipper transcription factor Batf2 is poorly described, whereas Batf
and Batf3 have been shown to play essential roles in dendritic cell, T cell, and 
B cell development and regulation. Batf2 was drastically induced in
IFN-<U+03B3>-activated classical macrophages (M1) compared with unstimulated or
IL-4-activated alternative macrophages (M2). Batf2 knockdown experiments from
IFN-<U+03B3>-activated macrophages and subsequent expression profiling demonstrated
important roles for regulation of immune responses, inducing inflammatory and
host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, and Nos2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Beijing
strain HN878)-infected macrophages further induced Batf2 and augmented
host-protective Batf2-dependent genes, particularly in M1, whose mechanism was
suggested to be mediated through both TLR2 and TLR4 by LPS and heat-killed HN878 
(HKTB) stimulation experiments. Irf1 binding motif was enriched in the promoters 
of Batf2-regulated genes. Coimmunoprecipitation study demonstrated Batf2
association with Irf1. Furthermore, Irf1 knockdown showed downregulation of
IFN-<U+03B3>- or LPS/HKTB-activated host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, Il12b, and Nos2.
Conclusively, Batf2 is an activation marker gene for M1 involved in gene
regulation of IFN-<U+03B3>-activated classical macrophages, as well as LPS/HKTB-induced 
macrophage stimulation, possibly by Batf2/Irf1 gene induction. Taken together,
these results underline the role of Batf2/Irf1 in inducing inflammatory responses
in M. tuberculosis infection.

OBJECTIVES: IBDs have an increased risk for development of colorectal cancer
(CRC). Here, we aimed at the characterisation of the functional role of
Th17-associated transcription factors in sporadic and colitis-associated colon
cancer in vivo.
DESIGN: We used mice deficient or transgenic for the activating protein 1 family 
member basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (Batf) to evaluate the 
role of Th17 cells during sporadic and inflammation-induced colon carcinogenesis.
We also studied the expression of Batf and ROR<U+03B3>t in patients with IBD and CRC.
RESULTS: Batf but not retinoic acid-related orphan receptor <U+03B3>t(ROR<U+03B3>t) expression 
was significantly increased together with interleukin (IL) 23 expression in UC
but not in Crohn's disease (CD) tissue samples. In CRC also Batf but not ROR<U+03B3>t
expression was increased and its expression correlated with the IL-23 and IL-23
receptor (IL-23R) expression. Finally, Batf but not ROR<U+03B3>t was coexpressed with
IL-17a, IL-23R and IL-6 within CRC-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells. Functional
studies in mice revealed that Batf-dependent T cells are crucial regulators of
sporadic and inflammation-induced CRC. Colitis-associated Batf(-/-) tumours
lacked IL-17a(+)IL-23R(+)IL-6(+)CD4(+) T cells, hence displaying characteristics 
reminiscent of human CRC-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells. Strikingly, Batf(-/-)
tumours contained low IL-23 but high IL-17a expression levels. Tumour formation
and intratumoral IL-23 expression could be restored by administration of
Hyper-IL-6 consisting of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: Batf-dependent IL-23R(+)IL-6(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells critically control 
IL-23 driven colitis-associated tumour formation and the progression of sporadic 
colon tumours. Batf-dependent IL-23R(+) T cells represent a potential future
therapeutic target limiting CRC progression.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the expression and clinical significance of BATF2 in
the oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC).
METHODS: Expression of BATF2 mRNA and protein in 16 paired OTSCC tissues and
adjacent non-tumor mucosa were examined using quantitative PCR, western blotting 
analysis and immunohistochemistry assays, and the relation between BATF2
expression and clinical pathologic factor and prognosis was analyzed.
RESULTS: In 16 paired tissues, expression of BATF2 mRNA in 13 OTSCC tissues and
expression of BATF2 protein in 14 OTSCC tissues were significantly lower than
that in adjacent non-tumor mucosa. In 202 paraffin-embedded OTSCC samples, BATF2 
was not expressed in 20 cases (9.9%), low expressed in 104 cases (51.5%) and
highly expressed in 78 (38.6%). BATF2 expression level was significantly
correlated with histological differentiation (P = 0.002). Patients with low BATF2
expression had significantly poorer overall survival and disease-free survival
than those with high BATF2 expression (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: BATF2 was low expressed in OTSCC and related to tumor
differentiation and prognosis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and
potential therapeutic target for this disease.

The onset of protective immunity against pathogenic SIV challenge in
SIV<U+0394>nef-vaccinated macaques is delayed for 15-20 weeks, a process that is related
to qualitative changes in CD8+ T cell responses induced by SIV<U+0394>nef. As a novel
approach to characterize cell differentiation following vaccination, we used
multi-target qPCR to measure transcription factor expression in naïve and memory 
subsets of CD8++ T cells, and in SIV-specific CD8+ T cells obtained from
SIV<U+0394>nef-vaccinated or wild type SIVmac239-infected macaques. Unsupervised
clustering of expression profiles organized naïve and memory CD8+ T cells into
groups concordant with cell surface phenotype. Transcription factor expression
patterns in SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in SIV<U+0394>nef-vaccinated animals were distinct
from those observed in purified CD8+ T cell subsets obtained from naïve animals, 
and were intermediate to expression profiles of purified central memory and
effector memory T cells. Expression of transcription factors elicited by SIV<U+0394>nef 
vaccination also varied over time: cells obtained at later time points,
temporally associated with greater protection, appeared more central-memory like 
than cells obtained at earlier time points, which appeared more effector
memory-like. Expression of transcription factors associated with effector
differentiation, such as ID2 and RUNX3, were decreased over time, while
expression of transcription factors associated with quiescence or memory
differentiation, such as TCF7, BCOR and EOMES, increased. CD8+ T cells specific
for a more conserved epitope expressed higher levels of TBX21 and BATF, and
appeared more effector-like than cells specific for an escaped epitope,
consistent with continued activation by replicating vaccine virus. These data
suggest transcription factor expression profiling is a novel method that can
provide additional data complementary to the analysis of memory cell
differentiation based on classical phenotypic markers. Additionally, these data
support the hypothesis that ongoing stimulation by SIV<U+0394>nef promotes a distinct
protective balance of CD8+ T cell differentiation and activation states.

PURPOSE: BATF2, a novel IFN-stimulated gene, inhibits tumor cell proliferation,
invasion, and migration. The objectives of this study were to determine how BATF2
expression is associated with colorectal cancer progression and patient outcome, 
to investigate how BATF2 overexpression inhibits hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF)/MET signaling, and to elucidate the rationale for combining MET inhibitors 
with IFN.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BATF2 expression in colorectal cancer tissues was determined
and correlated with colorectal cancer patient prognosis. Cultured colorectal
cancer cells were used to investigate the effects of BATF2 overexpression on the 
malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer cells and HGF/MET signaling. Tumor
xenograft models were used to validate the effects of BATF2 on colorectal cancer 
xenograft growth and assess the efficacy of the combination of MET inhibitors
with IFNs in colorectal cancer.
RESULTS: In colorectal cancer tissues, BATF2 was found to be significantly
downregulated, and its expression negatively correlated with MET expression.
Decreased BATF2 expression was associated with progression and shorter patient
survival in colorectal cancer. BATF2 overexpression promoted apoptosis and
inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in colorectal cancer cells, as
well as dramatically blunted tumor xenograft growth. In addition, MET inhibitors 
in combination with IFNß produced synergistic cytotoxicity both in vitro and in
vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these novel findings suggest that BATF2, a tumor
suppressor gene, is a potent negative regulator of HGF/MET signaling in
colorectal cancer and may serve as a prognostic tumor marker. Furthermore, these 
results provide a rationale for combining MET inhibitors with IFNs in preclinical
trials.

NFATc1 deletion in T lymphocytes inhibits the allergic trait in a murine model of
asthma.

Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: NFATc1 isoforms are highly regulated in peripheral T cells where they
contribute to the effector function and cell homeostasis.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the role of NFATc1 in asthma and in T cells.
METHODS: In a murine model of allergic asthma, we analysed differences in T-cell 
development in this allergic disease model, between wild-type and NFATc1
conditional knockout mice. Thus, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to
investigate the mRNA expression of Th2-associated genes as well as genes that are
involved in IgE immunoglobulin class-switch. Additionally, we used ELISA, Western
blot and flow cytometry (FACS) to analyse protein concentrations of Th1-, Th2-
and Th17-specific transcription factors and cytokines and the Th2 chemokine,
thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/chemokine ligand 17 (TARC/CCL17) by
ELISA.
RESULTS: Mice lacking NFATc1 in CD4(+) T cells display a significant reduction in
lung Th2 and Th17 as well as an increase of Th1 cells in an experimental asthma
model. Additionally, Batf gene, a recently described transcription factor of the 
Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation as well as a key T and B transcription factor
involved in the IgE immunoglobulin class-switch, was found decreased in the lungs
of these mice. As a consequence, serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 levels were
found significantly decreased after allergen exposure and in the absence of
NFATc1 in T cells in experimental allergic asthma.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Targeting NFATc1 in T lymphocytes ameliorated
the allergic trait in the airways of NFATc1(fl/fl) xCD4Cre mice. NFATc1 emerges
as a novel target for anti-allergy intervention.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) underscore the genetic basis of multiple
sclerosis (MS); however, only few of the newly reported genetic variations
relevant in MS have been replicated or correlated for clinical/paraclinical
phenotypes such as spinal cord atrophy in independent patient cohorts. We
genotyped 141 MS patients for 58 variations reported to reach significance in
GWAS. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and disease duration (DD) are
available from regular clinical examinations. MRI included sagittal
high-resolution 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient 
echo of the cervical cord region used for volumetry. Due dependency of mean upper
cervical cord area (MUCCA) with EDSS and/or DD, correction operations were
performed compensating for EDSS/DD. We assessed each MS risk locus for possible
MUCCA association. We identified twelve risk loci that significantly correlated
with MUCCA. For nine loci-BATF, CYP27B1, IL12B, NFKB1, IL7, PLEK, EVI5, TAGAP and
nrs669607-patients revealed significantly higher degree of atrophy; TYK2, RGS1
and CLEC16A revealed inverse effects. The weighted genetic risk score over the
twelve loci showed significant correlation with MUCCA. Our data reveal a risk
gene depending paraclinical/clinical phenotype. Since MUCCA clearly correlates
with disability, the candidates identified here may serve as prognostic markers
for disability progression.

Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT-Treg cells)
are functionally specialized tissue-resident cells that prevent
obesity-associated inflammation and preserve insulin sensitivity and glucose
tolerance. Their development depends on the transcription factor PPAR-<U+03B3>; however,
the environmental cues required for their differentiation are unknown. Here we
show that interleukin 33 (IL-33) signaling through the IL-33 receptor ST2 and
myeloid differentiation factor MyD88 is essential for development and maintenance
of VAT-Treg cells and sustains their transcriptional signature. Furthermore, the 
transcriptional regulators BATF and IRF4 were necessary for VAT-Treg
differentiation through direct regulation of ST2 and PPAR-<U+03B3> expression. IL-33
administration induced vigorous population expansion of VAT-Treg cells, which
tightly correlated with improvements in metabolic parameters in obese mice. Human
omental adipose tissue Treg cells also showed high ST2 expression, suggesting an 
evolutionarily conserved requirement for IL-33 in VAT-Treg cell homeostasis.

The differentiation of effector CD8(+) T cells is critical for the development of
protective responses to pathogens and for effective vaccines. In the first few
hours after activation, naive CD8(+) T cells initiate a transcriptional program
that leads to the formation of effector and memory T cells, but the regulation of
this process is poorly understood. Investigating the role of specific
transcription factors (TFs) in determining CD8(+) effector T-cell fate by gene
knockdown with RNAi is challenging because naive T cells are refractory to
transduction with viral vectors without extensive ex vivo stimulation, which
obscures the earliest events in effector differentiation. To overcome this
obstacle, we developed a novel strategy to test the function of genes in naive
CD8(+) T cells in vivo by creating bone marrow chimera from hematopoietic
progenitors transduced with an inducible shRNA construct. Following hematopoietic
reconstitution, this approach allowed inducible in vivo gene knockdown in any
cell type that developed from this transduced progenitor pool. We demonstrated
that lentivirus-transduced progenitor cells could reconstitute normal
hematopoiesis and develop into naive CD8(+) T cells that were indistinguishable
from wild-type naive T cells. This experimental system enabled induction of
efficient gene knockdown in vivo without subsequent manipulation. We applied this
strategy to show that the TF BATF is essential for initial commitment of naive
CD8(+) T cells to effector development but becomes dispensable by 72h. This
approach makes possible the study of gene function in vivo in unperturbed cells
of hematopoietic origin that are refractory to viral transduction.

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) conversion of B-lymphocytes to Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines
(LCLs) requires four EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) oncoproteins: EBNA2, EBNALP,
EBNA3A, and EBNA3C. EBNA2 and EBNALP associate with EBV and cell enhancers,
up-regulate the EBNA promoter, MYC, and EBV Latent infection Membrane Proteins
(LMPs), which up-regulate BCL2 to protect EBV-infected B-cells from MYC
proliferation-induced cell death. LCL proliferation induces p16(INK4A) and
p14(ARF)-mediated cell senescence. EBNA3A and EBNA3C jointly suppress p16(INK4A) 
and p14(ARF), enabling continuous cell proliferation. Analyses of the EBNA3A
human genome-wide ChIP-seq landscape revealed 37% of 10,000 EBNA3A sites to be at
strong enhancers; 28% to be at weak enhancers; 4.4% to be at active promoters;
and 6.9% to be at weak and poised promoters. EBNA3A colocalized with BATF-IRF4,
ETS-IRF4, RUNX3, and other B-cell Transcription Factors (TFs). EBNA3A sites
clustered into seven unique groups, with differing B-cell TFs and epigenetic
marks. EBNA3A coincidence with BATF-IRF4 or RUNX3 was associated with stronger
EBNA3A ChIP-Seq signals. EBNA3A was at MYC, CDKN2A/B, CCND2, CXCL9/10, and BCL2, 
together with RUNX3, BATF, IRF4, and SPI1. ChIP-re-ChIP revealed complexes of
EBNA3A on DNA with BATF. These data strongly support a model in which EBNA3A is
tethered to DNA through a BATF-containing protein complexes to enable continuous 
cell proliferation.

Here we describe increased expression of IL6R in the tumoural region of lung
tissue from patients affected by lung adenocarcinoma as compared to squamous cell
lung carcinoma. Moreover, here we found increased IL6R in the tumour free part of
the lung. By using a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma, we discovered that few 
lung tumour cells expressed IL-6R and CD4+CD25+Foxp-3+ T regulatory cells
down-regulated IL-6R in the tumour bearing lungs. Downstream of IL-6R, the Th17
lineage-specification factors: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3), Basic leucine zipper transcription factor, BATF and a protein encoded by
the RORC in human (RAR-related orphan receptor C) (ROR<U+03B3>T), were also found
induced in the tumoural region of lung tissue from patients affected by lung
adenocarcinoma as compared to those carrying squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover,
pSTAT3 protein was found phosphorylated and auto-phosphorylated in the tumoural
region of patients with adeno cell carcinoma of the lung as compared to the
tumoural region of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Intranasal 
application of anti-IL-6R antibodies in a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma,
induced T regulatory cell markers such as Foxp3, Ctla4, Icos, Il10, Il21, Folr4

The lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Interferon (IFN) Regulatory Factor 4
(IRF4) is implicated in certain types of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with these
malignancies are largely unknown. In this study, we have first profiled molecular
signatures associated with IRF4 expression in associated cancers, by analyzing
existing gene expression profiling datasets. Our results show that IRF4 is
overexpressed in melanoma, in addition to previously reported contexts including 
leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma, and that IRF4 is associated with a unique gene
expression pattern in each context. A pool of important genes involved in B-cell 
development, oncogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and cell death including BATF,
LIMD1, CFLAR, PIM2, and CCND2 are common signatures associated with IRF4 in
non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. We confirmed the correlation of IRF4 with LIMD1 and
CFLAR in a panel of cell lines derived from lymphomas. Moreover, we profiled the 
IRF4 transcriptome in the context of EBV latent infection, and confirmed several 
genes including IFI27, IFI44, GBP1, and ARHGAP18, as well as CFLAR as novel
targets for IRF4. These results provide valuable information for understanding
the IRF4 regulatory network, and improve our knowledge of the unique roles of
IRF4 in different hematological malignancies.

MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci
implicated in disease susceptibility. Integration of GWAS summary statistics
(P-values) and functional genomic datasets should help to elucidate mechanisms.
RESULTS: We extended a non-parametric SNP set enrichment method to test for
enrichment of GWAS signals in functionally defined loci to a situation where only
GWAS P-values are available. The approach is implemented in VSEAMS, a freely
available software pipeline. We use VSEAMS to identify enrichment of type 1
diabetes (T1D) GWAS associations near genes that are targets for the
transcription factors IKZF3, BATF and ESRRA. IKZF3 lies in a known T1D
susceptibility region, while BATF and ESRRA overlap other immune disease
susceptibility regions, validating our approach and suggesting novel avenues of
research for T1D.

CONTEXT: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on differentiated thyroid cancer
(DTC) have identified robust associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) at 9q22.33 (FOXE1), 14q13.3 (NKX2-1), and 2q35 (DIRC3). Our recently
published GWAS suggested additional susceptibility loci specific for the
high-incidence Italian population.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify novel Italian-specific DTC
risk variants based on our GWAS and to test them further in low-incidence
populations.
DESIGN: We investigated 45 SNPs selected from our GWAS first in an Italian
population. SNPs that showed suggestive evidence of association were investigated
in the Polish and Spanish cohorts.
RESULTS: The combined analysis of the GWAS and the Italian replication study
(2260 case patients and 2218 control subjects) provided strong evidence of
association with rs10136427 near BATF (odds ratio [OR] =1.40, P = 4.35 × 10(-7)) 
and rs7267944 near DHX35 (OR = 1.39, P = 2.13 × 10(-8)). A possible role in DTC
susceptibility in the Italian populations was also found for rs13184587 (ARSB) (P
= 8.54 × 10(-6)) and rs1220597 (SPATA13) (P = 3.25 × 10(-6)). Only the
associations between rs10136427 and rs7267944 and DTC risk were replicated in the
Polish and the Spanish populations with little evidence of population
heterogeneity (GWAS and all replications combined, OR = 1.30, P = 9.30 × 10(-7)
and OR = 1.32, P = 1.34 × 10(-8), respectively). In silico analyses provided new 
insights into the possible functional consequences of the SNPs that showed the
strongest association with DTC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence for novel DTC susceptibility variants.
Further studies are warranted to identify the specific genetic variants
responsible for the observed associations and to functionally validate our in
silico predictions.

Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is central to the transcriptional network
of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), an aggressive
lymphoma subgroup defined by gene expression profiling. Since cofactor
association modifies transcriptional regulatory input by IRF4, we assessed genome
occupancy by IRF4 and endogenous cofactors in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. IRF4 partners
with SPIB, PU.1 and BATF genome-wide, but SPIB provides the dominant IRF4 partner
in this context. Upon SPIB knockdown IRF4 occupancy is depleted and neither PU.1 
nor BATF acutely compensates. Integration with ENCODE data from lymphoblastoid
cell line GM12878, demonstrates that IRF4 adopts either SPIB- or BATF-centric
genome-wide distributions in related states of post-germinal centre B-cell
transformation. In primary DLBCL high-SPIB and low-BATF or the reciprocal
low-SPIB and high-BATF mRNA expression links to differential gene expression
profiles across nine data sets, identifying distinct associations with SPIB
occupancy, signatures of B-cell differentiation stage and potential pathogenetic 
mechanisms. In a population-based patient cohort, SPIBhigh/BATFlow-ABC-DLBCL is
enriched for mutation of MYD88, and SPIBhigh/BATFlow-ABC-DLBCL with MYD88-L265P
mutation identifies a small subgroup of patients among this otherwise aggressive 
disease subgroup with distinct favourable outcome. We conclude that differential 
expression of IRF4 cofactors SPIB and BATF identifies biologically and clinically
significant heterogeneity among ABC-DLBCL.

Induction of Bcl6 (B cell lymphoma 6) is essential for T follicular helper (Tfh) 
cell differentiation of antigen-stimulated CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, we found
that Bcl6 was also highly and transiently expressed during the CD4(+)CD8(+)
(double positive [DP]) stage of T cell development, in association with the E3
ligase cullin 3 (Cul3), a novel binding partner of Bcl6 which ubiquitinates
histone proteins. DP stage-specific deletion of the E3 ligase Cul3, or of Bcl6,
induced the derepression of the Bcl6 target genes Batf (basic leucine zipper
transcription factor, ATF-like) and Bcl6, in part through epigenetic
modifications of CD4(+) single-positive thymocytes. Although they maintained an
apparently normal phenotype after emigration, they expressed increased amounts of
Batf and Bcl6 at basal state and produced explosive and prolonged Tfh responses
upon subsequent antigen encounter. Ablation of Cul3 in mature CD4(+) splenocytes 
also resulted in dramatically exaggerated Tfh responses. Thus, although previous 
studies have emphasized the essential role of Bcl6 in inducing Tfh responses, our
findings reveal that Bcl6-Cul3 complexes also provide essential negative feedback
regulation during both thymocyte development and T cell activation to restrain
excessive Tfh responses.

Leishmania major infection induces self-healing cutaneous lesions in C57BL/6
mice. Both IL-12 and IFN-<U+03B3> are essential for the control of infection. We
infected Jun dimerization protein p21SNFT (Batf3(-/-) ) mice (C57BL/6 background)
that lack the major IL-12 producing and cross-presenting CD8a(+) and CD103(+) DC 
subsets. Batf3(-/-) mice displayed enhanced susceptibility with larger lesions
and higher parasite burden. Additionally, cells from draining lymph nodes of
infected Batf3(-/-) mice secreted less IFN-<U+03B3>, but more Th2- and Th17-type
cytokines, mirrored by increased serum IgE and Leishmania-specific immunoglobulin
1 (Th2 indicating). Importantly, CD8a(+) DCs isolated from lymph nodes of L.
major-infected mice induced significantly more IFN-<U+03B3> secretion by L.
major-stimulated immune T cells than CD103(+) DCs. We next developed
CD11c-diptheria toxin receptor: Batf3(-/-) mixed bone marrow chimeras to
determine when the DCs are important for the control of infection. Mice depleted 
of Batf-3-dependent DCs from day 17 or wild-type mice depleted of
cross-presenting DCs from 17-19 days after infection maintained significantly
larger lesions similar to mice whose Batf-3-dependent DCs were depleted from the 
onset of infection. Thus, we have identified a crucial role for Batf-3-dependent 
DCs in protection against L. major.

The transcription factor BATF is required for the differentiation of interleukin 
17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) and follicular helper T cells
(TFH cells). Here we identified a fundamental role for BATF in regulating the
differentiation of effector of CD8(+) T cells. BATF-deficient CD8(+) T cells
showed profound defects in effector population expansion and underwent
proliferative and metabolic catastrophe early after encountering antigen. BATF,
together with the transcription factors IRF4 and Jun proteins, bound to and
promoted early expression of genes encoding lineage-specific
transcription-factors (T-bet and Blimp-1) and cytokine receptors while
paradoxically repressing genes encoding effector molecules (IFN-<U+03B3> and granzyme
B). Thus, BATF amplifies T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-dependent expression of
transcription factors and augments the propagation of inflammatory signals but
restrains the expression of genes encoding effector molecules. This checkpoint
prevents irreversible commitment to an effector fate until a critical threshold
of downstream transcriptional activity has been achieved.

CD8(+) T-cell functions are critical for preventing chronic viral infections by
eliminating infected cells. For healthy immune responses, beneficial destruction 
of infected cells must be balanced against immunopathology resulting from
collateral damage to tissues. These processes are regulated by factors
controlling CD8(+) T-cell function, which are still incompletely understood.
Here, we show that the interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and its cooperating 
binding partner B-cell-activating transcription factor (BATF) are necessary for
sustained CD8(+) T-cell effector function. Although Irf4(-/-) CD8(+) T cells were
initially capable of proliferation, IRF4 deficiency resulted in limited CD8(+)
T-cell responses after infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.
Consequently, Irf4(-/-) mice established chronic infections, but were protected
from fatal immunopathology. Absence of BATF also resulted in reduced CD8(+)
T-cell function, limited immunopathology, and promotion of viral persistence.
These data identify the transcription factors IRF4 and BATF as major regulators
of antiviral cytotoxic T-cell immunity.

IL-1R antagonist-deficient (Il1rn(-/-)) mice develop autoimmune arthritis in
which IL-17A plays a crucial role. Although many studies have shown that Th17
cell differentiation is dependent on TGF-ß and IL-6, we found that Th17 cells
developed normally in Il1rn(-/-)Il6(-/-) mice in vivo. Then, we analyzed the
mechanisms of Th17 cell differentiation in Il1rn(-/-)Il6(-/-) mice. We found that
IL-21 production was increased in the lymph nodes of Il1rn(-/-) mice, naive
Il6(-/-) CD4(+) T cells differentiated into Th17 cells when cultured with TGF-ß
and IL-21, and the differentiation was greatly enhanced when IL-1 was added to
the culture. Th17 cell differentiation was not induced by either TGF-ß or IL-1
alone or in combination. IL-21 induced IL-1R expression in naive CD4(+) T cells, 
and IL-1 inhibited TGF-ß-induced Foxp3 expression, resulting in the promotion of 
Th17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, IL-1 augmented the expression of Th17
cell-specific transcription factors such as Nfkbiz and Batf. These results
indicate that excess IL-1 signaling can overcome the requirement of IL-6 in the
differentiation of Th17 cells by suppressing Foxp3 expression and inducing Th17
cell-specific transcription factors.

Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) repression of CDKN2A p14(ARF) and 
p16(INK4A) is essential for immortal human B-lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL)
growth. EBNA3C ChIP-sequencing identified >13,000 EBNA3C sites in LCL DNA. Most
EBNA3C sites were associated with active transcription; 64% were strong H3K4me1- 
and H3K27ac-marked enhancers and 16% were active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and 
H3K9ac. Using ENCODE LCL transcription factor ChIP-sequencing data, EBNA3C sites 
coincided (±250 bp) with RUNX3 (64%), BATF (55%), ATF2 (51%), IRF4 (41%), MEF2A
(35%), PAX5 (34%), SPI1 (29%), BCL11a (28%), SP1 (26%), TCF12 (23%), NF-<U+03BA>B (23%),
POU2F2 (23%), and RBPJ (16%). EBNA3C sites separated into five distinct clusters:
(i) Sin3A, (ii) EBNA2/RBPJ, (iii) SPI1, and (iv) strong or (v) weak BATF/IRF4.
EBNA3C signals were positively affected by RUNX3, BATF/IRF4 (AICE) and SPI1/IRF4 
(EICE) cooccupancy. Gene set enrichment analyses correlated EBNA3C/Sin3A promoter
sites with transcription down-regulation (P < 1.6 × 10(-4)). EBNA3C signals were 
strongest at BATF/IRF4 and SPI1/IRF4 composite sites. EBNA3C bound strongly to
the p14(ARF) promoter through SPI1/IRF4/BATF/RUNX3, establishing RBPJ-, Sin3A-,
and REST-mediated repression. EBNA3C immune precipitated with Sin3A and
conditional EBNA3C inactivation significantly decreased Sin3A binding at the
p14(ARF) promoter (P < 0.05). These data support a model in which EBNA3C binds
strongly to BATF/IRF4/SPI1/RUNX3 sites to enhance transcription and recruits
RBPJ/Sin3A- and REST/NRSF-repressive complexes to repress p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A)
expression.

BACKGROUND: Mice without the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like 
(BATF) gene (Batf(-/-)) lack TH17 and follicular helper T cells, which
demonstrates that Batf is a transcription factor important for T- and B-cell
differentiation.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we examined whether BATF expression would influence
allergic asthma.
METHODS: In a cohort of preschool control children and children with asthma, we
analyzed BATF mRNA expression using real-time PCR in PBMCs. In a murine model of 
allergic asthma, we analyzed differences in this allergic disease between
wild-type, Batf transgenic, and Batf(-/-) mice.
RESULTS: In the absence of corticosteroid treatment, children with recurrent
asthma have a significant increase in BATF mRNA expression in their PBMCs.
Batf(-/-) mice display a significant reduction in the pathophysiologic responses 
seen in asthmatic wild-type littermates. Moreover, we discovered a decrease in
IL-3 production and IL-3-dependent mast cell development in Batf(-/-) mice. By
contrast, IFN-<U+03B3> was induced in lung CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Intranasal
delivery of anti-IFN-<U+03B3> antibodies induced airway hyperresponsiveness and
inflammation in wild-type but not in Batf(-/-) mice. Transgenic overexpression of
Batf under the control of the CD2 promoter/enhancer augmented lung inflammation
and IgE levels in the setting of experimental asthma.
CONCLUSION: BATF is increased in non-steroid-treated asthmatic children.
Targeting BATF expression resulted in amelioration of the pathophysiologic
responses seen in children with allergic asthma, and BATF has emerged as a novel 
target for antiasthma interventions.

Th9 cell development requires a BATF-regulated transcriptional network.

MR, Kim MH, Tepper RS, Sun J, Kim CH, Taparowsky EJ, Zhou B, Kaplan MH.

T helper 9 (Th9) cells are specialized for the production of IL-9, promote
allergic inflammation in mice, and are associated with allergic disease in
humans. It has not been determined whether Th9 cells express a characteristic
transcriptional signature. In this study, we performed microarray analysis to
identify genes enriched in Th9 cells compared with other Th subsets. This
analysis defined a transcriptional regulatory network required for the expression
of a subset of Th9-enriched genes. The activator protein 1 (AP1) family
transcription factor BATF (B cell, activating transcription factorlike) was
among the genes enriched in Th9 cells and was required for the expression of IL-9
and other Th9-associated genes in both human and mouse T cells. The expression of
BATF was increased in Th9 cultures derived from atopic infants compared with Th9 
cultures from control infants. T cells deficient in BATF expression had a
diminished capacity to promote allergic inflammation compared with wild-type
controls. Moreover, mouse Th9 cells ectopically expressing BATF were more
efficient at promoting allergic inflammation than control transduced cells. These
data indicate that BATF is a central regulator of the Th9 phenotype and
contributes to the development of allergic inflammation.

Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of autoimmune
disease-susceptibility genes. Whether or not these loci share any regulatory or
functional elements, however, is an open question. Finding such common regulators
is of considerable research interest in order to define systemic therapeutic
targets. The growing amount of experimental genomic annotations, particularly
those from the ENCODE project, provide a wealth of opportunities to search for
such commonalities. We hypothesized that regulatory commonalities might not only 
delineate a regulatory landscape predisposing to autoimmune diseases, but also
define functional elements distinguishing specific diseases. We further
investigated if, and how, disease-specific epigenomic elements can identify novel
genes yet to be associated with the diseases. We evaluated transcription factors,
histone modifications, and chromatin state data obtained from the ENCODE project 
for statistically significant over- or under-representation in the promoters of
genes associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis
(RA), and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). We identified BATF, BCL11A, IRF4, NFkB, PAX5,
and PU.1 as transcription factors over-represented in SLE- and RA-susceptibility 
gene promoters. H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 epigenomic marks were associated with SLE
susceptibility genes, and H3K9me3 was common to both SLE and RA. In contrast to a
transcriptionally active signature in SLE and RA, SSc-susceptibility genes were
depleted in activating epigenomic elements. Using epigenomic elements enriched in
SLE and RA, we identified additional immune and B cell signaling-related genes
with the same elements in their promoters. Our analysis suggests common and
disease-specific epigenomic elements that may define novel therapeutic targets
for controlling aberrant activation of autoimmune susceptibility genes.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigens EBNALP (LP) and EBNA2 (E2) are
coexpressed in EBV-infected B lymphocytes and are critical for lymphoblastoid
cell line outgrowth. LP removes NCOR and RBPJ repressive complexes from
promoters, enhancers, and matrix-associated deacetylase bodies, whereas E2
activates transcription from distal enhancers. LP ChIP-seq analyses identified
19,224 LP sites of which ~50% were ± 2 kb of a transcriptional start site. LP
sites were enriched for B-cell transcription factors (TFs), YY1, SP1, PAX5, BATF,
IRF4, ETS1, RAD21, PU.1, CTCF, RBPJ, ZNF143, SMC3, NF<U+03BA>B, TBLR, and EBF. E2 sites 
were also highly enriched for LP-associated cell TFs and were more highly
occupied by RBPJ and EBF. LP sites were highly marked by H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H2Az, 
H3K9ac, RNAPII, and P300, indicative of activated transcription. LP sites were
29% colocalized with E2 (LP/E2). LP/E2 sites were more similar to LP than to E2
sites in associated cell TFs, RNAPII, P300, and histone H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac,
and H2Az occupancy, and were more highly transcribed than LP or E2 sites. Gene
affected by CTCF and LP cooccupancy were more highly expressed than genes
affected by CTCF alone. LP was at myc enhancers and promoters and of MYC
regulated ccnd2, 23 med complex components, and MYC regulated cell survival
genes, igf2r and bcl2. These data implicate LP and associated TFs and DNA looping
factors CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and YY1/INO80 chromatin-remodeling complexes in
repressor depletion and gene activation necessary for lymphoblastoid cell line
growth and survival.

Hematopoietic stem cell injury induced by ionizing radiation.

Shao L(1), Luo Y, Zhou D.

Author information:

University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , Little Rock, Arkansas.

SIGNIFICANCE: Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) as the result of nuclear
accidents or terrorist attacks is a significant threat and a major medical
concern. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) injury is the primary cause of death after
accidental or intentional exposure to a moderate or high dose of IR. Protecting
HSCs from IR should be a primary goal in the development of novel medical
countermeasures against radiation.
RECENT ADVANCES: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the
mechanisms by which IR causes HSC damage. The mechanisms include (i) induction of
HSC apoptosis via the p53-Puma pathway; (ii) promotion of HSC differentiation via
the activation of the G-CSF/Stat3/BATF-dependent differentiation checkpoint;
(iii) induction of HSC senescence via the ROS-p38 pathway; and (iv) damage to the
HSC niche.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Induction of apoptosis in HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor
cells is primarily responsible for IR-induced acute bone marrow (BM) injury.
Long-term BM suppression caused by IR is mainly attributable to the induction of 
HSC senescence. However, the promotion of HSC differentiation and damage to the
HSC niche can contribute to both the acute and long-term effects of IR on the
hematopoietic system.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: In this review, we have summarized a number of recent findings
that provide new insights into the mechanisms whereby IR damages HSCs. These
findings will provide new opportunities for developing a mechanism-based strategy
to prevent and/or mitigate IR-induced BM suppression. Antioxid.

OVA-induced acute asthma by inhibiting B-cell activating transcription factor
signalling and Th17 function.

Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that dopamine D1-like receptor
(D1-like-R) signalling is implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis and type I diabetes. Given that allergic asthma
shares certain disease aetiology similarities with autoimmune diseases, we
conducted studies in OVA-induced mice aiming to address the impact of D1-like-R
signalling on the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. It was noted that blockade of 
D1-like-R signalling provided protection for mice against OVA-induced acute
asthma. Particularly, treatment of OVA-induced mice with SCH23390, a D1-like-R
antagonist, significantly attenuated inflammatory infiltration in the airways
along with repressed goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production, as well as
airway resistance. By contrast, administration of SKF83959, a D1-like-R agonist, 
displayed the opposite effect. Blockade of D1-like-R signalling impaired Th17
function, as manifested by a significant reduction of Th17 cells in the spleen
and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Mechanistic studies revealed that D1-like-R
signalling enhances B-cell activating transcription factor activity, which then
transcribes the expression of ROR<U+03B3>t, a Th17 transcription factor; accordingly,
D1-like-R signalling regulates Th17 differentiation to promote the development of
allergic asthma. Taken together, the data obtained in the present suggest that
blockade of D1-like-R signalling could be an effective therapeutic strategy for
the prevention and treatment of allergic asthma in clinical practice.

Dendritic cells (DCs) drive both adaptive and innate immunity. Recent findings
support the notion that distinct subsets of classical DCs favor alternative
modules of immunity, acting on innate lymphoid-like cells (ILCs) and T cells
similarly to promote either ILC1/Th1/CTL- or ILC3/Th17-type responses.
Coordination between DC subsets and their favored immune module might imply that 
the genetic programs for DC diversification preceded the emergence of
recombination-activating gene-dependent adaptive immunity and operate initially
in coordinating ILC repertoires for appropriate responses against pathogens.
Consequently, understanding the molecular basis of DC developmental and
diversification is important for an underlying appreciation of immune regulation.
Currently, the basis for DC development into the recognized subsets/lineages is
only partially understood, based on the requirements for several transcription
factors including PU.1, Bcl11a, Irf8, E2-2, Id2, Irf4, Irf8, Batf3, and other
BATF family members. This chapter will briefly review recent transcriptional
aspects of DC development and function and then highlight some currently
unresolved questions.

Systemic autoimmunity is characterized by widespread inflammation, autoantibody
production and immune complex deposition. The regulatory mechanisms for the
systemic autoimmunity are not fully understood. A paper by Li et al. revealed
that Egr2 and Egr3, transcription factors required for T-cell anergy, are the
regulators for systemic autoimmune disease. They showed evidence that Egr2 and
Egr3 control cytokine productions and cell proliferation via SOCS and Batf
regulation.

Developing efficacious vaccines against enteric diseases is a global challenge
that requires a better understanding of cellular recruitment dynamics at the
mucosal surfaces. The current paradigm of T cell homing to the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract involves the induction of a4ß7 and CCR9 by Peyer's patch and
mesenteric lymph node (MLN) dendritic cells (DCs) in a retinoic acid-dependent
manner. This paradigm, however, cannot be reconciled with reports of GI T cell
responses after intranasal (i.n.) delivery of antigens that do not directly
target the GI lymphoid tissue. To explore alternative pathways of cellular
migration, we have investigated the ability of DCs from mucosal and nonmucosal
tissues to recruit lymphocytes to the GI tract. Unexpectedly, we found that lung 
DCs, like CD103(+) MLN DCs, up-regulate the gut-homing integrin a4ß7 in vitro and
in vivo, and induce T cell migration to the GI tract in vivo. Consistent with a
role for this pathway in generating mucosal immune responses, lung DC targeting
by i.n. immunization induced protective immunity against enteric challenge with a
highly pathogenic strain of Salmonella. The present report demonstrates novel
functional evidence of mucosal cross talk mediated by DCs, which has the
potential to inform the design of novel vaccines against mucosal pathogens.

The Emerging Role of Interleukin-21 in Transplantation.

Since its discovery in 2000, IL-21 has been shown to play critical roles in the
regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-21 is produced
predominantly by multiple effector CD4(+) T-cell types [T helper 17 (Th17),
follicular helper T (TFH), and other activated CD4(+) cells] and NKT cells. In
addition to T cell receptor (TCR) signals, the production of IL-21 by activated
CD4(+) T cells is intricately regulated by various extrinsic factors and
intrinsic molecules, such as IL-6, IL-21, ICOS, Stat3, IRF4, and Batf. Because
IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) is broadly expressed on T, B, NK, and dentritic cells
(DCs), IL-21 signaling via Jak-Stat and other pathways has direct pleiotropic
effects on their proliferation, differentiation, and effector function. For
instance, while Th17 and TFH cells produce IL-21, IL-21 also facilitates the
development of these cells. IL-21-producing TFH cells are important for the
generation and maintenance of germinal centers, and control the differentiation
of germinal center B cells and immunoglobulin production. Thus, IL-21R deficiency
or IL-21 neutralization with IL-21R-Fc fusion protein prevents B cell-mediated
autoimmunity in lupus-prone BXSB.B6-Yaa (+) or MRL-Fas(lpr) mouse models,
respectively. IL-21 also enhances expansion and cytotoxicity of CD8(+) effector T
cells. During chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral infection, chronic IL-21
production by antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells is needed to sustain CD8(+) T cell 
function for viral control. IL-21 is also required for the development of T
cell-mediated type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, possibly through sustaining effector T
cell function in a similar manner. Recently, two papers have shown that IL-21R-Fc
prevents both auto- and allo-immune responses after islet transplantation. A
timely discussion is thus needed to address the immune actions of IL-21 as well
as the therapeutic potential of targeting IL-21 in transplantation.

Basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF), BATF2 and BATF3 belong
to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors, which regulate
numerous cellular processes. Initially, BATF family members were thought to
function only as inhibitors of AP-1-driven transcription, but recent studies have
uncovered that these factors have unique, non-redundant and positive
transcriptional activities in dendritic cells, B cells and T cells. The question 
of how BATF and BATF3 - which lack a transcriptional activation domain, unlike
the AP-1 factors FOS and JUN - can exert unique positive transcriptional
specificity has now been answered by the discovery that BATF molecules interact
with members of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family. The capacity of
the BATF leucine zipper regions to mediate dimerization with AP-1 factors and
also to define cooperative interactions with heterologous factors explains both
the positive transcriptional activity of BATF proteins and how they activate
distinct sets of target genes compared with FOS.

The transcription factor IRF4 regulates immunoglobulin class switch recombination
and plasma cell differentiation. Its differing concentrations appear to regulate 
mutually antagonistic programs of B and plasma cell gene expression. We show IRF4
to be also required for generation of germinal center (GC) B cells. Its transient
expression in vivo induced the expression of key GC genes including Bcl6 and
Aicda. In contrast, sustained and higher concentrations of IRF4 promoted the
generation of plasma cells while antagonizing the GC fate. IRF4 cobound with the 
transcription factors PU.1 or BATF to Ets or AP-1 composite motifs, associated
with genes involved in B cell activation and the GC response. At higher
concentrations, IRF4 binding shifted to interferon sequence response motifs;
these enriched for genes involved in plasma cell differentiation. Our results
support a model of "kinetic control" in which signaling-induced dynamics of IRF4 
in activated B cells control their cell-fate outcomes.

IL-6 plays a central role in supporting pathological T(H2) and T(H17) cell
development and inhibiting the protective T regulatory cells in allergic asthma. 
T(H17) cells have been demonstrated to regulate allergic asthma in general and
T-bet-deficiency-induced asthma in particular. Here we found an inverse
correlation between T-bet and Il-6 mRNA expression in asthmatic children.
Moreover, experimental subcutaneous immunotherapy (SIT) in T-bet((-/-)) mice
inhibited IL-6, IL-21R and lung T(H17) cells in a setting of asthma. Finally,
local delivery of an anti-IL-6R antibody in T-bet((-/-)) mice resulted in the
resolution of this allergic trait. Noteworthy, BATF, crucial for the
immunoglobulin-class-switch and T(H2),T(H17) development, was found
down-regulated in the lungs of T-bet((-/-)) mice after SIT and after treatment
with anti-IL-6R antibody, indicating a critical role of IL-6 in controlling
BATF/IRF4 integrated functions in T(H2), T(H17) cells and B cells also in a T-bet
independent fashion in allergic asthma.

BATF regulates the development and function of IL-17 producing iNKT cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences and Purdue University Center for Cancer
Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.

BACKGROUND: BATF plays important roles in the function of the immune system. Batf
null mice are deficient in both CD4+ Th17 cells and T follicular helper cells and
possess an intrinsic B cell defect that leads to the complete absence of class
switched Ig. In this study, Tg mice overexpressing BATF in T cells were used
together with Batf null mice to investigate how altering levels of BATF
expression in T cells impacts the development and function of a recently
characterized population of iNKT cells expressing IL-17 (iNKT-17).
RESULTS: BATF has a direct impact on IL-17 expression by iNKT cells. However, in 
contrast to the Th17 lineage where BATF activates IL-17 expression and leads to
the expansion of the lineage, BATF overexpression restricts overall iNKT cell
numbers while skewing the compartment in vivo and in vitro toward an iNKT-17
phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first to demonstrate that BATF joins ROR<U+03B3>t as the
molecular signature for all IL-17 producing cells in vivo and identifies BATF as 
a component of the nuclear protein network that could be targeted to regulate
IL-17-mediated disease. Interestingly, these studies also reveal that while the
Il17a gene is a common target for BATF regulation in Th17 and iNKT-17 cells, this
regulation is accompanied by opposite effects on the growth and expansion of
these two cell lineages.

Cellular immune responses play a crucial role in the control of viral replication
in HIV-infected individuals. However, the virus succeeds in exploiting the immune
system to its advantage and therefore, the host ultimately fails to control the
virus leading to development of terminal AIDS. The virus adopts numerous evasion 
mechanisms to hijack the host immune system. We and others recently described the
expression of inhibitory molecules on T cells as a contributing factor for
suboptimal T-cell responses in HIV infection both in vitro and in vivo. The
expression of these molecules that negatively impacts the normal functions of the
host immune armory and the underlying signaling pathways associated with their
enhanced expression need to be discussed. Targets to restrain the expression of
these molecular markers of immune inhibition is likely to contribute to
development of therapeutic interventions that augment the functionality of host
immune cells leading to improved immune control of HIV infection. In this review,
we focus on the functions of inhibitory molecules that are expressed or secreted 
following HIV infection such as BTLA, CTLA-4, CD160, IDO, KLRG1, LAG-3, LILRB1,
PD-1, TRAIL, TIM-3, and regulatory cytokines, and highlight their significance in
immune inhibition. We also highlight the ensemble of transcriptional factors such
as BATF, BLIMP-1/PRDM1, FoxP3, DTX1 and molecular pathways that facilitate the
recruitment and differentiation of suppressor T cells in response to HIV
infection.

CCR9 and a4ß7 are the major trafficking receptors for lymphocyte migration to the
gut, and their expression is induced during lymphocyte activation under the
influence of retinoic acid (RA). We report here that BATF (basic leucine zipper
transcription factor, ATF-like), an AP-1 protein family factor, is required for
optimal expression of CCR9 and a4ß7 by T helper cells. BATF-deficient (knockout
[KO]) mice had reduced numbers of effector T and regulatory T cells in the
intestine. The intestinal T cells in BATF KO mice expressed CCR9 and a4ß7 at
abnormally low levels compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts, and BATF
KO CD4(+) T cells failed to up-regulate the expression of CCR9 and a4ß7 to WT
levels in response to RA. Defective binding of RARa and histone acetylation at
the regulatory regions of the CCR9 and Itg-a4 genes were observed in BATF KO T
cells. As a result, BATF KO effector and FoxP3(+) T cells failed to populate the 
intestine, and neither population functioned normally in the induction and
regulation of colitis. Our results establish BATF as a cellular factor required
for normal expression of CCR9 and a4ß7 and for the homeostasis and effector
functions of T cell populations in the intestine.

hTERT inhibition triggers Epstein-Barr virus lytic cycle and apoptosis in
immortalized and transformed B cells: a basis for new therapies.

PURPOSE: Induction of viral lytic cycle, which induces death of host cells, may
constitute a useful adjunct to current therapeutic regimens for Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV)-driven malignancies. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), 
essential for the oncogenic process, may modulate the switch from latent to lytic
infection. The possible therapeutic role of hTERT inhibition combined with
antiviral drugs was investigated.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: EBV-negative BL41 and convertant EBV-positive BL41/B95.8
Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were infected
with retroviral vector encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) anti-hTERT and cultured
with or without the prodrug ganciclovir. The effects on EBV lytic replication,
cell proliferation, and apoptosis were characterized.
RESULTS: hTERT silencing by shRNA induced the expression of BZLF1, EA-D, and
gp350 EBV lytic proteins and triggered a complete lytic cycle. This effect was
associated with downregulation of BATF, a negative regulator of BZLF1
transcription. hTERT silencing also resulted in antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects. In particular, hTERT inhibition induced an accumulation of 
cells in the S-phase, an effect likely due to the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, an
AKT1-dependent substrate, which results in a decreased availability of proteins
needed for cell-cycle progression. Besides inducing cell death through activation
of complete EBV lytic replication, hTERT inhibition triggered
AKT1/FOXO3/NOXA-dependent apoptosis in EBV-positive and -negative Burkitt's
lymphoma cells. Finally, ganciclovir enhanced the apoptotic effect induced by
hTERT inhibition in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphomas and LCLs.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that combination of antiviral drugs with
strategies able to inhibit hTERT expression may result in therapeutically
relevant effects in patients with EBV-related malignancies.

Th cells can adopt a number of different phenotypes. We performed
microarray-assisted mRNA profiling on antigen-stimulated, TCR transgenic murine
splenocytes that were cultured in the presence of cytokines. Transcriptome
snapshots of Th cells differentiating into Th1 and Th2 phenotypes were obtained
at various time points. Principal component analysis shows that time since
activation and Th skewing are the largest sources of variance (i.e. the largest
contributing factors) in our profiling experiments. Divergence between the Th1
and Th2 phenotypes is established early and does not increase in terms of number 
of differential genes from day 1 to day 4 after stimulation. Notwithstanding the 
lack of further divergence between the Th1 and Th2 lineages, we show that gene
expression is best described by a 'turnover' rather than a 'core response' model,
although we find evidence for both. We identify clusters of skewed genes
associated with early persistent ('core response') and late ('turnover') Th1 and 
Th2 gene expression. In addition to the classical Th genes, members of the Batf
transcription factor family are differentially expressed in particular helper
phenotypes, suggesting an important role for this family in Th-cell phenotype
differentiation.

of the classification existing studies display variability in classifier
implementation, and a comparative analysis across multiple data sets is lacking. 
Here we describe the validation of a cell of origin classifier for DLBCL, based
on balanced voting between 4 machine-learning tools: the DLBCL automatic
classifier (DAC). This shows superior survival separation for assigned Activated 
B-cell (ABC) and Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL classes relative to a range
of other classifiers. DAC is effective on data derived from multiple microarray
platforms and formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples and is parsimonious, using
20 classifier genes. We use DAC to perform a comparative analysis of gene
expression in 10 data sets (2030 cases). We generate ranked meta-profiles of
genes showing consistent class-association using =6 data sets as a cut-off: ABC
(414 genes) and GCB (415 genes). The transcription factor ZBTB32 emerges as the
most consistent and differentially expressed gene in ABC-DLBCL while other
transcription factors such as ARID3A, BATF, and TCF4 are also amongst the 24
genes associated with this class in all datasets. Analysis of enrichment of 12323
gene signatures against meta-profiles and all data sets individually confirms
consistent associations with signatures of molecular pathways, chromosomal
cytobands, and transcription factor binding sites. We provide DAC as an open
access Windows application, and the accompanying meta-analyses as a resource.

Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.

T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a new subset of effector CD4(+) T cells that 
are specialized in helping B cells in the germinal center reaction. Tfh cells are
distinct from other established CD4(+) T-cell lineages, Th1, Th2, Th17, and
T-regulatory cells, in their gene expression profiles. Tfh cell differentiation
results from a network of transcriptional regulation by a master transcriptional 
factor Bcl6 as well as IRF4, c-Maf, Batf, and STAT3/5. During Tfh cell ontogeny, 
increased CXCR5 expression directs activated T-cell migration to the follicles,
and their interaction with B cells leads to Bcl6 upregulation, which helps
establish effector and memory Tfh cell program. This review summarizes the recent
progress in molecular mechanisms underlying Tfh differentiation and discusses the
future perspectives for this important area of research.

by negatively regulating Batf.

Early growth response gene (Egr)-2 is important for the maintenance of T cell
homeostasis and controls the development of autoimmune disease. However, the
underlying mechanisms are unknown. We have now discovered that Egr-2, which is
induced by TGF-ß and IL-6, negatively regulates the expression of IL-17, but not 
IL-2 or IFN-<U+03B3>, in effector T cells. In the absence of Egr-2, CD4 T cells produce 
high levels of Th17 cytokines, which renders mice susceptible to experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis induction. T cells lacking Egr-2 show increased
propensity for Th17, but not Th1 or Th2, differentiation. Control of IL-17
expression and Th17 differentiation by Egr-2 is due to inhibition of Batf, a
transcription factor that regulates IL-17 expression and Th17 differentiation.
Egr-2 interacts with Batf in CD4 T cells and suppresses its interaction with DNA 
sequences derived from the IL-17 promoter, whereas the activation of STAT3 and
expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor <U+03B3>t are unchanged in Th17
cells in the absence of Egr-2. Thus, Egr-2 plays an important role to
intrinsically control Th17 differentiation. We also found that CD4 T cells from
multiple sclerosis patients have reduced expression of Egr-2 and increased
expression of IL-17 following stimulation with anti-CD3 in vitro. Collectively,
our results demonstrate that Egr-2 is an intrinsic regulator that controls Th17
differentiation by inhibiting Batf activation, which may be important for the
control of multiple sclerosis development.

Follicular Th (T(FH)) cells have emerged as a new Th subset providing help to B
cells and supporting their differentiation into long-lived plasma cells or memory
B cells. Their differentiation had not yet been investigated following neonatal
immunization, which elicits delayed and limited germinal center (GC) responses.
We demonstrate that neonatal immunization induces CXCR5(high)PD-1(high) CD4(+)
T(FH) cells that exhibit T(FH) features (including Batf, Bcl6, c-Maf, ICOS, and
IL-21 expression) and are able to migrate into the GCs. However, neonatal T(FH)
cells fail to expand and to acquire a full-blown GC T(FH) phenotype, as reflected
by a higher ratio of GC T(FH)/non-GC CD4(+) T cells in immunized adults than
neonates (3.8 × 10(-3) versus 2.2 × 10(-3), p = 0.01). Following the adoptive
transfer of naive adult OT-II CD4(+) T cells, OT-II T(FH) cells expand in the
vaccine-draining lymph nodes of immunized adult but not infant recipients,
whereas naive 2-wk-old CD4(+) OT-II cells failed to expand in adult hosts,
reflecting the influence of both environmental and T cell-intrinsic factors.
Postponing immunization to later in life increases the number of T(FH) cells in a
stepwise manner, in direct correlation with the numbers of GC B cells and plasma 
cells elicited. Remarkably, adjuvantation with CpG oligonucleotides markedly
increased GC T(FH) and GC B cell neonatal responses, up to adult levels. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the T(FH) cell development limits
early life GC responses and that adjuvants/delivery systems supporting T(FH)
differentiation may restore adultlike early life GC B cell responses.

Lymphocytes provide optimal responses against pathogens with minimal inflammatory
pathology. However, the intrinsic mechanisms regulating these responses are
unknown. Here, we report that deletion of both transcription factors Egr2 and
Egr3 in lymphocytes resulted in a lethal autoimmune syndrome with excessive serum
proinflammatory cytokines but also impaired antigen receptor-induced
proliferation of B and T cells. Egr2- and Egr3-defective B and T cells had
hyperactive signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT3 
while antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factor AP-1 was
severely impaired. We discovered that Egr2 and/or Egr3 directly induced
expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, inhibitors of
STAT1 and STAT3, and also blocked the function of Batf, an AP-1 inhibitor, in B
and T cells. Thus, Egr2 and Egr3 regulate B and T cell function in adaptive
immune responses and homeostasis by promoting antigen receptor signaling and
controlling inflammation.

Th17 cells have critical roles in mucosal defense and are major contributors to
inflammatory disease. Their differentiation requires the nuclear hormone receptor
ROR<U+03B3>t working with multiple other essential transcription factors (TFs). We have 
used an iterative systems approach, combining genome-wide TF occupancy,
expression profiling of TF mutants, and expression time series to delineate the
Th17 global transcriptional regulatory network. We find that cooperatively bound 
BATF and IRF4 contribute to initial chromatin accessibility and, with STAT3,
initiate a transcriptional program that is then globally tuned by the
lineage-specifying TF ROR<U+03B3>t, which plays a focal deterministic role at key loci. 
Integration of multiple data sets allowed inference of an accurate predictive
model that we computationally and experimentally validated, identifying multiple 
new Th17 regulators, including Fosl2, a key determinant of cellular plasticity.
This interconnected network can be used to investigate new therapeutic approaches
to manipulate Th17 functions in the setting of inflammatory disease.

The AP1 transcription factor Batf3 is required for homeostatic development of
CD8a(+) classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell responses against
intracellular pathogens. Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent
pathway in mice for CD8a(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12
and interferon-<U+03B3>. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation
for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and
B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally,
physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for
expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the
shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors 
such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably,
manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of
value in augmenting immune responses to vaccines.

Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is an IRF family transcription factor with 
critical roles in lymphoid development and in regulating the immune response.
IRF4 binds DNA weakly owing to a carboxy-terminal auto-inhibitory domain, but
cooperative binding with factors such as PU.1 or SPIB in B cells increases
binding affinity, allowing IRF4 to regulate genes containing ETS-IRF composite
elements (EICEs; 5'-GGAAnnGAAA-3'). Here we show that in mouse CD4(+) T cells,
where PU.1/SPIB expression is low, and in B cells, where PU.1 is well expressed, 
IRF4 unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1) complexes to bind 
to AP1-IRF4 composite (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3') motifs that we denote as AP1-IRF
composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein complexes cooperate
with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in pre-activated CD4(+) T cells stimulated with
IL-21 and in T(H)17 differentiated cells. Importantly, BATF binding was
diminished in Irf4(-/-) T cells and IRF4 binding was diminished in Batf(-/-) T
cells, consistent with functional cooperation between these factors. Moreover, we
show that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10
gene, which is expressed in T(H)17 cells and potently regulated by IL-21. These
findings reveal that IRF4 can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs
depending on the cellular context, thus indicating new approaches for modulating 
IRF4-dependent transcription.

Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and IRF8 regulate B, T, macrophage, and
dendritic cell differentiation. They are recruited to cis-regulatory Ets-IRF
composite elements by PU.1 or Spi-B. How these IRFs target genes in most T cells 
is enigmatic given the absence of specific Ets partners. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing in T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells reveals that IRF4
targets sequences enriched for activating protein 1 (AP-1)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are co-bound by BATF, an AP-1 factor required for T(H)17, B, and
dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind cooperatively to structurally 
divergent AICEs to promote gene activation and T(H)17 differentiation. The AICE
motif directs assembly of IRF4 or IRF8 with BATF heterodimers and is also used in
T(H)2, B, and dendritic cells. This genomic regulatory element and cognate
factors appear to have evolved to integrate diverse immunomodulatory signals.

Overexpression of Batf induces an apoptotic defect and an associated

Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a dimeric transcription factor composed of the Jun,
Fos and Atf families of proteins. Batf is expressed in the immune system and
participates in AP-1 dimers that modulate gene expression in response to a
variety of stimuli. Transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human BATF in T cells
were generated using the human CD2 promoter (CD2-HA (hemagglutinin antigen) -
BATF). By 1 year of age, over 90% of the mice developed a lymphoproliferative
disorder (LPD). The enlarged lymph nodes characteristic of this LPD contain a
polyclonal accumulation of T cells with a CD4(+) bias, yet efforts to propagate
these tumor cells in vitro demonstrate that they do not proliferate as well as
wild-type CD4(+) T cells. Instead, the accumulation of these cells is likely due 
to an apoptotic defect as CD2-HA-BATF Tg T cells challenged by trophic factor
withdrawal in vitro resist apoptosis and display a pro-survival pattern of Bcl-2 
family protein expression. As elevated levels of Batf expression are a feature of
lymphoid tumors in both humans and mice, these observations support the use of
CD2-HA-BATF mice as a model for investigating the molecular details of apoptotic 
dysregulation in LPD.

Checkpoints that limit stem cell self-renewal in response to DNA damage can
contribute to cancer protection but may also promote tissue aging. Molecular
components that control stem cell responses to DNA damage remain to be
delineated. Using in vivo RNAi screens, we identified basic leucine zipper
transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) as a major component limiting self-renewal 
of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in response to telomere dysfunction and
<U+03B3>-irradiation. DNA damage induces BATF in a G-CSF/STAT3-dependent manner
resulting in lymphoid differentiation of HSCs. BATF deletion improves HSC
self-renewal and function in response to <U+03B3>-irradiation or telomere shortening but
results in accumulation of DNA damage in HSCs. Analysis of bone marrow from
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome supports the conclusion that DNA
damage-dependent induction of BATF is conserved in human HSCs. Together, these
results provide experimental evidence that a BATF-dependent differentiation
checkpoint limits self-renewal of HSCs in response to DNA damage.

Recent work has identified a new subset of CD4(+) T cells named as Tfh cells that
are localized in germinal centers and critical in germinal center formation. Tfh 
cell differentiation is regulated by IL-6 and IL-21, possibly via STAT3 factor,
and B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) is specifically expressed in Tfh cells and required 
for their lineage specification. In the current study, we characterized the role 
of STAT5 in Tfh cell development. We found that a constitutively active form of
STAT5 effectively inhibited Tfh differentiation by suppressing the expression of 
Tfh-associated factors (CXC motif) receptor 5 (CXCR5), musculoaponeurotic
fibrosarcoma (c-Maf), Bcl6, basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like
(Batf), and IL-21, and STAT5 deficiency greatly enhanced Tfh gene expression.
Importantly, STAT5 regulated the expression of Tfh cell suppressor factor B
lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1); STAT5 deficiency impaired
Blimp-1 expression and resulted in elevated expression of Tfh-specific genes.
Similarly, inhibition of IL-2 potentiated Tfh generation, associated with
dampened Blimp-1 expression; Blimp-1 overexpression inhibited Tfh gene expression
in Stat5-deficient T cells, suggesting that the IL-2/STAT5 axis functions to
regulate Blimp-1 expression. In vivo, deletion of STAT5 in CD4(+) T cells
resulted in enhanced development of Tfh cells and germinal center B cells and led
to an impairment of B cell tolerance in a well defined mouse tolerance model.
Taken together, this study demonstrates that STAT5 controls Tfh differentiation.

Interleukin 22 (IL-22), which is produced by cells of the T(H)17 subset of helper
T cells and other leukocytes, not only enhances proinflammatory innate defense
mechanisms in epithelial cells but also provides crucial protection to tissues
from damage caused by inflammation and infection. In T(H)17 cells, transforming
growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) regulates IL-22 and IL-17 differently. IL-6 alone induces
T cells to produce only IL-22, whereas the combination of IL-6 and high
concentrations of TGF-ß results in the production of IL-17 but not IL-22 by T
cells. Here we identify the transcription factor c-Maf, which is induced by
TGF-ß, as a downstream repressor of Il22. We found that c-Maf bound to the Il22
promoter and was both necessary and sufficient for the TGF-ß-dependent
suppression of IL-22 production in T(H)17 cells.

IRAK-2 regulates IL-1-mediated pathogenic Th17 cell development in helminthic
infection.

Infection with the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni results in distinct
heterogeneity of disease severity both in humans and in mice. In the experimental
mouse model, severe disease is characterized by pronounced hepatic egg-induced
granulomatous inflammation mediated by CD4 Th17 cells, whereas mild disease is
associated with reduced hepatic inflammation in a Th2-skewed cytokine
environment. Even though the host's genetic background significantly impacts the 
clinical outcome of schistosomiasis, specific gene(s) that contribute to disease 
severity remain elusive. We investigated the schistosome infection in
wild-derived mice, which possess a more diverse gene pool than classically inbred
mouse strains and thus makes them more likely to reveal novel mechanisms of
immune regulation. We now show that inbred wild-derived MOLF mice develop severe 
hepatic inflammation with high levels of IL-17. Congenic mice with a MOLF locus
in chromosome 6, designated Why1, revealed high pathology and enabled the
identification of Irak2 as the pathogenic gene. Although IRAK-2 is classically
associated with TLR signaling, adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells revealed that
IRAK-2 mediates pathology in a CD4 T cell specific manner by promoting Th17 cell 
development through enhancement of IL-1ß-induced activation of transcription
factors ROR<U+03B3>t and BATF. The use of wild-derived mice unravels IRAK-2 as a novel
regulator of IL-1-induced pathogenic Th17 cells in schistosomiasis, which likely 
has wide-ranging implications for other chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases.

CD8 T cells play a critical role in protection against viral infections. During
effector differentiation, CD8 T cells dramatically change chromatin structure and
cellular metabolism, but how energy production increases in response to these
epigenetic changes is unknown. We found that loss of basic leucine zipper
transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) inhibited effector CD8 T-cell
differentiation. At the late effector stage, BATF was induced by IL-12 and
required for IL-12-mediated histone acetylation and survival of effector T cells.
BATF, together with c-Jun, transcriptionally inhibited expression of the
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase Sirt1, resulting
in increased histone acetylation of the T-bet locus and increased cellular
NAD(+), which increased ATP production. In turn, high levels of T-bet expression 
and ATP production promoted effector differentiation and cell survival. These
results suggest that BATF promotes effector CD8 T-cell differentiation by
regulating both epigenetic remodeling and energy metabolism through Sirt1
expression.

BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that atherosclerosis and inflammation are
intimately linked. Monocytes play a key role in both of these processes and we
hypothesized that activation of inflammatory pathways in monocytes would lead to,
among others, proatherogenic changes in the monocyte transcriptome. Such
differentially expressed genes in circulating monocytes would be strong
candidates for further investigation in disease association studies.
METHODS: Endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or saline control was infused in
healthy volunteers. Monocyte RNA was isolated, processed and hybridized to Hver
2.1.1 spotted cDNA microarrays. Differential expression of key genes was
confirmed by RT-PCR and results were compared to in vitro data obtained by our
group to identify candidate genes.
RESULTS: All subjects who received LPS experienced the anticipated clinical
response indicating successful stimulation. One hour after LPS infusion, 11 genes
were identified as being differentially expressed; 1 down regulated and 10 up
regulated. Four hours after LPS infusion, 28 genes were identified as being
differentially expressed; 3 being down regulated and 25 up regulated. No genes
were significantly differentially expressed following saline infusion. Comparison
with results obtained in in vitro experiments lead to the identification of 6
strong candidate genes (BATF, BID, C3aR1, IL1RN, SEC61B and SLC43A3)
CONCLUSION: In vivo endotoxin exposure of healthy individuals resulted in the
identification of several candidate genes through which systemic inflammation
links to atherosclerosis.

The transcription factor BATF controls the differentiation of interleukin 17
(IL-17)-producing helper T cells (T(H)17 cells) by regulating expression of the
transcription factor ROR<U+03B3>t itself and ROR<U+03B3>t target genes such as Il17. Here we
report the mechanism by which BATF controls in vivo class-switch recombination
(CSR). In T cells, BATF directly controlled expression of the transcription
factors Bcl-6 and c-Maf, both of which are needed for development of follicular
helper T cells (T(FH) cells). Restoring T(FH) cell activity to Batf(-/-) T cells 
in vivo required coexpression of Bcl-6 and c-Maf. In B cells, BATF directly
controlled the expression of both activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and
of germline transcripts of the intervening heavy-chain region and constant
heavy-chain region (I(H)-C(H)). Thus, BATF functions at multiple hierarchical
levels in two cell types to globally regulate switched antibody responses in
vivo.

Batf promotes growth arrest and terminal differentiation of mouse myeloid
leukemia cells.

Lafayette, IN 47907-2064, USA.

Batf is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor belonging to the activator
protein-1 superfamily. Batf expression is regulated following stimulation of both
lymphoid and myeloid cells. When treated with leukemia inhibitory factor, mouse
M1 myeloid leukemia cells commit to a macrophage differentiation program that is 
dependent on Stat3 and involves the induction of Batf gene transcription via the 
binding of Stat3 to the Batf promoter. RNA interference was employed to block
Batf induction in this system and the cells failed to growth arrest or to
terminally differentiate. Restoring Batf expression not only reversed the
differentiation-defective phenotype but also caused the cells to display signs of
spontaneous differentiation in the absence of stimulation. Efforts to define
genetic targets of the Batf transcription factor in M1 cells led to the
identification of c-myb, a proto-oncogene known to promote blood cell
proliferation and to inhibit the differentiation of M1 cells. These results
provide strong evidence that Batf mediates the differentiation-inducing effects
of Stat3 signaling in M1 cells and suggest that Batf may play a similar role in
other blood cell lineages where alterations to the Jak-Stat pathway are hallmarks
of disrupted development and disease.

Over the last decade, our understanding of helper/effector T cell differentiation
has changed dramatically. The discovery of interleukin (IL-)17-producing T cells 
(Th17) and other subsets has changed our view of T cell-mediated immunity.
Characterization of the signaling pathways involved in the Th17 commitment has
provided exciting new insights into the differentiation of CD4+ T cells.
Importantly, the emerging data on conversion among polarized T helper cells have 
raised the question how we should view such concepts as T cell lineage
commitment, terminal differentiation and plasticity. In this review, we will
discuss the current understanding of the signaling pathways, molecular
interactions, and transcriptional and epigenetic events that contribute to Th17
differentiation and acquisition of effector functions.

Disruption of cell spreading by the activation of MEK/ERK pathway is dependent on
AP-1 activity.

We previously reported that the disruption of cell spreading by v-Crk was
dependent on the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Here we demonstrate that the 
activation of that pathway is sufficient to suppress cell spreading. The MEK/ERK 
pathway regulates the activity of various proteins including AP-1, which is a
transcriptional factor composed of heterodimeric proteins. To examine whether
AP-1 activity is required for the suppression of cell spreading by the activation
of the MEK/ERK pathway, we expressed BATF, which is a negative regulator of AP-1.
The expression of BATF clearly restored cell spreading that was suppressed by the
activation of MEK/ERK pathway. In addition, a disrupted formation of stress
fibers and focal adhesions by such activation was restored by the suppression of 
AP-1. Our results define an essential role of the MEK/ERK/AP-1 pathway in the
disruption of actin cytoskeleton and cell spreading.

CD8(+) T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects
including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative
potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'. Exhausted T cells express
increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1
(PD-1), that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although
reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the
cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not
fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T
cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by
upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we
analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in individuals
with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in
exhausted CD8(+) T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation
of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in
the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell
proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1
inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia
rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell
exhaustion by upregulating genes--such as BATF--that inhibit T cell function.
Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity
to HIV.

The third lineage of T helper subsets, Th17, has recently been identified as an
IL- 17-producing CD4+ Th cell, and its functions and regulatory mechanisms have
been extensively characterized in immune responses. Functional studies have
provided evidence that Th17 cells are important for the modulation of autoimmune 
responses, such as chronic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel
diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Murine Th17 cell differentiation is enhanced by
the coordinated functions of distinct cytokines including TGFbeta, IL-6, IL-21,
and IL-23, whereas IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27 inhibit its differentiation.
In addition, Th17 cells are controlled by several transcription factors such as
RORgammat, IRF4, BATF, FoxP3, T-bet, PPARgamma, E-FABP, and SOCSs. This review
focuses on the functions and regulatory mechanisms of several transcription
factors in the control of Th17 cell differentiation.

Human BATF2, a basic leucine zipper protein, was recently detected in several
normal immortalized cell lines but not in transformed cell lines. In addition,
the expression of BATF2 also slowed the growth rate of malignant tumor cells
injected into athymic nude mice. In this study, to study the role of BATF2 in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we examined BATF2 expression in 50 paired HCC
tumorous and nontumorous tissues, as well as in five HCC cell lines. Moreover,
BATF2 expression in 114 HCC patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry,
and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis was
investigated. We found that BATF2 expression was significantly reduced in most
HCC tumorous tissues, when compared with nontumorous tissues, as well as in the
five HCC cell lines. Consistent with these results, the immunohistochemistry
revealed that decreased BATF2 expression was present in 63 of the 114 cases and
was significantly correlated with age (p = 0.006), tumor size (p = 0.046) and
tumor differentiation (p = 0.030). Patients with negative BATF2 expression showed
a shorter survival than those with positive expression (p = 0.016). Multivariate 
analysis revealed that BATF2 expression was an independent predictor of overall
survival (p = 0.015). All the data support the hypothesis that BATF2 plays an
important role in the progression of HCC and that it may work as a candidate
tumor suppressor and a prognostic marker as well as a potential target for
treatment.

Batf belongs to the activator protein 1 superfamily of basic leucine zipper
transcription factors that includes Fos, Jun, and Atf proteins. Batf is expressed
in mouse T and B lymphocytes, although the importance of Batf to the function of 
these lineages has not been fully investigated. We generated mice
(Batf(DeltaZ/DeltaZ)) in which Batf protein is not produced. Batf(DeltaZ/DeltaZ) 
mice contain normal numbers of B cells but show reduced numbers of peripheral
CD4(+) T cells. Analysis of CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell subsets in
Batf(DeltaZ/DeltaZ) mice demonstrated that Batf is required for the development
of functional Th type 17 (Th17), Th2, and follicular Th (Tfh) cells. In response 
to antigen immunization, germinal centers were absent in Batf(DeltaZ/DeltaZ) mice
and the maturation of Ig-secreting B cells was impaired. Although adoptive
transfer experiments confirmed that this B cell phenotype can be driven by
defects in the Batf(DeltaZ/DeltaZ) CD4(+) T cell compartment, stimulation of
Batf(DeltaZ/DeltaZ) B cells in vitro, or by a T cell-independent antigen in vivo,
resulted in proliferation but not class-switch recombination. We conclude that
loss of Batf disrupts multiple components of the lymphocyte communication network
that are required for a robust immune response.

T helper (Th) 17 cells are a recently identified subset of T cells that regulate 
tissue inflammation, and RORgammat and RORalpha have been shown to be
Th17-specific transcription factors that mediate Th17 cell generation. A new
study of Batf-deficient mice shows that this AP-1 family transcription factor
also regulates Th17 cell differentiation by binding to Th17-associated gene
promoters and by maintaining RORalpha and RORgammat expression, shedding new
lights on current clinical modulation of Th17 cell function in inflammatory
diseases.

disease patients.

PURPOSE: The mechanisms involved in the appearance of a second neoplasia in
patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) are probably related to the genomic damage
induced by the treatments administered and its repair. Here, we searched for some
constitutive molecular mechanisms that in a basal manner may influence the
behavior of HD patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We aimed to evaluate with the Comet Assay whether baseline, 
induced, and unrepaired DNA damage differ between HD patients who did not develop
a second neoplasia (HD-NST), HD patients who developed a second tumor (HD-ST),
and healthy individuals; and to identify, through cDNA microarray hybridization, 
an expression signature of genes that could discriminate between the three
groups.
RESULTS: Baseline, induced, and unrepaired DNA damage was higher in HD-ST than in
HD-NST and higher in the second group than in healthy donors. The genomic
approach revealed two sets of genes that discriminated between healthy subjects
and patients and between the three sets of individuals. Hsp40, RAD50, TPMT,
Rap2a, E2F2, EPHX2, TBX21, and BATF were validated by reverse transcription-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional and genomic techniques revealed that alterations in cell 
cycle, repair, detoxification, and stress response pathways could be involved in 
the development of HD and in the occurrence of a primary second neoplasia in
these patients. Both approaches may be useful as biological markers in the
clinical setting.

Activator protein 1 (AP-1, also known as JUN) transcription factors are dimers of
JUN, FOS, MAF and activating transcription factor (ATF) family proteins
characterized by basic region and leucine zipper domains. Many AP-1 proteins
contain defined transcriptional activation domains, but BATF and the closely
related BATF3 (refs 2, 3) contain only a basic region and leucine zipper, and are
considered to be inhibitors of AP-1 activity. Here we show that Batf is required 
for the differentiation of IL17-producing T helper (T(H)17) cells. T(H)17 cells
comprise a CD4(+) T-cell subset that coordinates inflammatory responses in host
defence but is pathogenic in autoimmunity. Batf(-/-) mice have normal T(H)1 and
T(H)2 differentiation, but show a defect in T(H)17 differentiation, and are
resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Batf(-/-) T cells fail to
induce known factors required for T(H)17 differentiation, such as RORgamma t
(encoded by Rorc) and the cytokine IL21 (refs 14-17). Neither the addition of
IL21 nor the overexpression of RORgamma t fully restores IL17 production in
Batf(-/-) T cells. The Il17 promoter is BATF-responsive, and after T(H)17
differentiation, BATF binds conserved intergenic elements in the Il17a-Il17f
locus and to the Il17, Il21 and Il22 (ref. 18) promoters. These results
demonstrate that the AP-1 protein BATF has a critical role in T(H)17
differentiation.

Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 play critical roles in tumor invasion, but their productions
are differentially controlled. While the promoter region of MMP-9 has the
conserved proximal AP-1 binding site, that of the MMP-2 has a noncanonical AP-1
site. To assess the role of AP-1 function, we examined the effects of
dominant-negative Fos (DeltaFos), BATF and siRNA against c-Jun on MMP production 
in v-Crk-transformed cells which have augmented production of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
Suppression of AP-1 dependent transcription by conditional expression of
dominant-negative Fos (DeltaFos) and BATF substantially inhibited not only MMP-9 
production but also MMP-2 production. The ChIP analysis showed the direct
association of AP-1 and MMP-2 promoter region. In addition, silencing of c-Jun
expression by siRNA transfection suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 production and in
vitro invasiveness. Furthermore, the invadopodia formation of v-Crk-transformed
cells could be suppressed by BATF expression or c-Jun siRNA treatment. Taken
together, AP-1 appears to play a critical role in the production of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 and invadopodia formation of v-Crk-transformed cells.

Sensitivity of NK1.1-negative NKT cells to transgenic BATF defines a role for
activator protein-1 in the expansion and maturation of immature NKT cells in the

NKT cells are glycolipid-reactive lymphocytes that express markers and perform
functions common to both T lymphocytes and NK cells. Although the genetic events 
controlling conventional T cell development are well defined, the transcription
factors and genetic programs regulating NKT cell development are only beginning
to be elucidated. Previously, we described the NKT cell-deficient phenotype of
transgenic (Tg) mice constitutively expressing B cell-activating transcription
factor (BATF), a basic leucine zipper protein and inhibitor of AP-1. In this
study, we show that Tg BATF targets the majority of Valpha14Jalpha281
(Valpha14i(7)) NKT cells, regardless of CD4 expression and Vbeta gene usage. The 
residual NKT cells in the thymus of BATF-Tg mice are CD44(+), yet are slow to
display the NK1.1 marker characteristic of mature cells. As a population,
BATF-expressing NKT cells are TCRbeta/CD3epsilon(low), but express normal levels 
of CD69, suggesting a failure to expand appropriately following selection.
Consistent with the sensitivity of NKT cells to BATF-induced changes in AP-1
activity, we detect a full complement of AP-1 basic leucine zipper proteins in
wild-type NKT cells isolated from the thymus, spleen, and liver, and show that
AP-1 DNA-binding activity and cytokine gene transcription are induced in NKT
cells within a few hours of glycolipid Ag exposure. This study is the first to
characterize AP-1 activity in NKT cells and implicates the integrity of this
transcription factor complex in developmental events essential to the
establishment of this unique T cell subset in the thymus.

Direct manipulation of activator protein-1 controls thymocyte proliferation in

West Lafayette, IN 479071-2054, USA.

B cell activating transcription factor (BATF) belongs to the activator protein-1 
(AP-1) superfamily of basic leucine zipper transcription factors and forms
heterodimers with Jun that possess minimal transcriptional activity. Mice
carrying a p56(lck)HA-BATF transgene were created to observe the effects of
constitutive expression of this well-characterized AP-1 inhibitor on T cell
proliferation. Consistent with the role of AP-1 in promoting the proliferation of
many cell types, BATF-transgenic thymocytes proliferate poorly in vitro when
stimulated with anti-CD3epsilon and anti-CD28 antibodies or with Concanavalin A. 
However, when BATF-transgenic thymocytes were stimulated using a standard
treatment of PMA and ionomycin, proliferation is normal. The responsiveness to
PMA and ionomycin can be attributed to the dramatic disappearance of the
hemagglutinin antigen (HA)-tagged BATF protein which is a PKC-dependent process
caused by the down-regulation of the p56(lck) proximal promoter coupled with the 
rapid turnover of the HA-BATF protein. These studies describe conditions of T
cell stimulation that negatively influence transcription of the widely used
p56(lck) proximal promoter expression cassette. In addition, the unique
circumstances of this regulation were exploited to demonstrate that inhibition of
AP-1 activity by BATF exerts a direct, and reversible, effect on T cell
proliferation in vitro.

Retroviral activation of the AP-1/ATF super family member Jdp2 was recently
reported to be a common event in M-MLV-induced T cell lymphoma in p27-null
C57x129 mice as compared to wild type-inoculated mice but has not been found
important in other models. On the basis of retroviral tag retrieval from 1190
individual Akv- and SL3-3-induced lymphomas, we here report that insertional
mutagenesis into the 250-kb Fos/Jdp2/Batf locus is associated with SL3-3
MLV-induced T but not Akv-induced B cell lymphomas of NMRI and SWR mice.
Integration pattern and clonality analyses suggest that Jdp2 participates in
SL3-3-induced tumorigenesis distinctly as compared to the M-MLV setting. Northern
blot analysis showed Jdp2 to be alternatively spliced in various normal tissues
as well as MLV-induced lymphomas. Interestingly, in some tumors, proviral
insertion seems to activate different mRNA sub-species. Whereas elevated mRNA
levels of the Fos gene could not be correlated with provirus presence, in one
case, Northern blot analysis as well as quantitative real-time PCR indicated
proviral activation of the AP-1 super family member Batf, a gene not previously
reported to be a target of insertional mutagenesis. A novel integration cluster
between Jdp2 and Batf apparently did not influence the expression level of either
gene, underscoring the importance of addressing expression effects to identify
target genes of insertion. Altogether, such distinct insertion patterns point to 
different mechanism of activation of specific proto-oncogenes and are
consequently of importance for the understanding of proviral activation
mechanisms as well as the specific role of individual oncogenes in tumor

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with
cancers in immunocompromised populations. Antiviral drugs targeted against lytic 
viral replication have limited efficacy in these disease settings. EBV infection 
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells induces growth proliferation and the EBV
latency Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)2 transcriptional
transactivator (TAT) is essential for this response. EBNA2 targets the cellular
DNA-binding protein CBF1 to mimic activated Notch signaling. A 10-aa peptide from
the CBF1 interaction domain of EBNA2 was synthesized as a fusion with the protein
transduction domain of HIV-1 TAT. The EBNA2-TAT peptide blocked EBNA2-CBF1
interaction in an in vitro GST affinity assay and labeling with fluorescein
confirmed that the EBNA2-TAT peptide efficiently entered cultured B cells.
Neither EBNA2-TAT, nor a mutant peptide with a 2-aa substitution that was unable 
to block the EBNA2-CBF1 interaction, significantly affected the growth of
non-EBNA2-expressing EBV(-) B cells or Burkitt's lymphoma Akata cells. However,
treatment of an EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line with the EBNA2-TAT
peptide stopped cell growth and reduced cell viability. RT-PCR analyses of gene
expression in the peptide-treated lymphoblastoid cell line cultures revealed that
EBNA2-TAT treatment down-regulated the EBNA2-responsive viral LMP1 and LMP2 genes
and cellular CD23, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, BATF, and Cdk1 genes while 
up-regulating expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21.
EBV-induced outgrowth of B cells from cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells
was also blocked in a dose-responsive manner by the EBNA2-TAT peptide. This study
suggests that cell-permeable EBNA2 peptides may have potential as novel anti-EBV 
therapeutics.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10), originally identified as an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory
cytokine production, exerts multiple immunomodulatory functions. Its ability to
inhibit a Th1 response has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of
inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. However, little is known about the
molecular mechanisms of IL-10 functions. We aimed at identifying possible
mediators of in vitro IL-10 treatment in monocytes by gene chip technology using 
Hu95a Affymetrix mRNA arrays with 12,000 genes. To prove relevance of the
identified genes for the clinical situation we compared these in vitro results
with genes being regulated by IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
psoriatic patients undergoing IL-10 therapy. A high proportion of the 1,600 genes
up-regulated and 1,300 genes down-regulated in vitro was found to be similarly
regulated in vivo. Some genes, which were previously unknown to be regulated by
IL-10, can be assigned to known IL-10 functions like e.g. the increase of
pathogen clearance. Other new potentially immunomodulating genes have been
identified to be regulated by IL-10, but their impact needs to be experimentally 
evaluated. We could confirm a recently reported up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1). However, we demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-10
remain functional even when HO-1 is irreversibly inhibited.

Phosphorylation of BATF regulates DNA binding: a novel mechanism for AP-1
(activator protein-1) regulation.

BATF is a member of the AP-1 (activator protein-1) family of bZIP (basic leucine 
zipper) transcription factors that form transcriptionally inhibitory, DNA binding
heterodimers with Jun proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate that BATF is
phosphorylated in vivo on multiple serine and threonine residues and at least one
tyrosine residue. Reverse-polarity PAGE revealed that serine-43 and threonine-48 
within the DNA binding domain of BATF are phosphorylated. To model
phosphorylation of the BATF DNA binding domain, serine-43 was replaced by an
aspartate residue. BATF(S43D) retains the ability to dimerize with Jun proteins
in vitro and in vivo, and the BATF(S43D):Jun heterodimer localizes properly to
the nucleus of cells. Interestingly, BATF(S43D) functions like wild-type BATF to 
reduce AP-1-mediated gene transcription, despite the observed inability of the
BATF(S43D):Jun heterodimer to bind DNA. These data demonstrate that
phosphorylation of serine-43 converts BATF from a DNA binding into a non-DNA
binding inhibitor of AP-1 activity. Given that 40% of mammalian bZIP
transcription factors contain a residue analogous to serine-43 of BATF in their
DNA binding domains, the phosphorylation event described here represents a
mechanism that is potentially applicable to the regulation of many bZIP proteins.

The immortalization of human B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) requires
the virus-encoded transactivator EBNA2 and the products of both viral and
cellular genes which serve as EBNA2 targets. In this study, we identified BATF as
a cellular gene that is up-regulated dramatically within 24 h following the
infection of established and primary human B cells with EBV. The transactivation 
of BATF is mediated by EBNA2 in a B-cell-specific manner and is duplicated in
non-EBV-infected B cells by the expression of mammalian Notch proteins. In
contrast to other target genes activated by EBNA2, the BATF gene encodes a member
of the AP-1 family of transcription factors that functions as a negative
regulator of AP-1 activity and as an antagonist of cell growth. A potential role 
for BATF in promoting EBV latency is supported by studies in which BATF was shown
to negatively impact the expression of a BZLF1 reporter gene and to reduce the
frequency of lytic replication in latently infected cells. The identification of 
BATF as a cellular target of EBV provides important new information on how
programs of viral and cellular gene expression may be coordinated to promote
viral latency and control lytic-cycle entry.

The importance of regulated AP-1 activity during T cell development was assessed 
using transgenic mice overexpressing BATF, a basic leucine zipper transcription
factor and an AP-1 inhibitor. BATF transgenic animals possess normal thymic
cellularity and all major T cell subsets, but show impaired thymocyte
proliferation in vitro and no induction of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13
expression. Since NKT cells are largely responsible for cytokine production in
the thymus, this population was examined by detection of the V alpha 14-J alpha
281 TCR, flow cytometry of NK1.1(+) TCR beta(+) cells, and analysis of cytokine
production by heat-stable Ag(low) thymocytes and peripheral NKT cells stimulated 
in vivo. Results show a severe under-representation of NKT cells in BATF
transgenic animals, providing the first evidence that the precise control of
AP-1-mediated transcription is critical for the proper emergence of
thymus-derived NKT cells in the mouse.

Stat3 mediates cellular responses associated with proliferation, survival and
differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying the diverse effects of this
signaling molecule remain unknown. M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells arrest growth 
and differentiate into macrophages following treatment with interleukin 6 (IL-6) 
or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and recent studies have shown that Stat3
plays a central role in this process. Utilizing representational difference
analysis, we demonstrate that expression of the mouse BATF gene is upregulated as
an early response to IL-6/LIF stimulation and Stat3 activation in this cell
system. Immunoblots using antibodies to BATF detected an increase in BATF protein
in response to LIF/IL-6 stimulation. BATF is a member of the AP-1 family of basic
leucine zipper transcription factors and functions to inhibit the transcriptional
and biological functions of AP-1 activity in mammalian cells. BATF forms
complexes with c-Jun in M1 cells and forced expression of BATF in the absence of 
Stat3 signaling results in a reduced rate of cellular growth. These results
indicate that Stat3 mediates cellular growth by modulating AP-1 activity through 
the induction of BATF.

BATF belongs to the AP-1/ATF superfamily of transcription factors and forms
heterodimers with Jun proteins to bind AP-1 consensus DNA. Unlike Fos/Jun
heterodimers which stimulate gene transcription, BATF/Jun heterodimers are
transcriptionally inert and inhibit biological processes that are associated with
the overstimulation of AP-1 activity. Here, we describe the murine BATF cDNA and 
genomic clones and map the BATF locus to chromosome 12 D2-3. Using in situ
hybridization of BATF mRNA, we show that BATF gene expression is highly
restricted, with the most prominent signals detected in the thymus. BATF mRNA
levels are regulated differentially during discrete stages of T cell development 
and are up-regulated following activation of T cells in the periphery. To
demonstrate the impact of BATF on AP-1 activity in vivo, AP-1 luciferase reporter
mice were crossed to transgenic mice overexpressing BATF exclusively in thymic T 
cells. Results show that elevated levels of BATF protein correlate with reduced
transactivation by AP-1. Since the differential regulation of AP-1 activity is
linked to key transitions in the developing immune system, our observations
support a critical role for BATF in determining the overall level of AP-1
activity, and thus AP-1 target gene expression, in specific T cell subtypes.

B-ATF functions as a negative regulator of AP-1 mediated transcription and blocks
cellular transformation by Ras and Fos.

Echlin DR(1), Tae HJ, Mitin N, Taparowsky EJ.

(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana

B-ATF is a nuclear basic leucine zipper protein that belongs to the AP-1/ATF
superfamily of transcription factors. Northern blot analysis reveals that the
human B-ATF gene is expressed most highly in hematopoietic tissues. Interaction
studies in vitro and in vivo show that the leucine zipper of B-ATF mediates
dimerization with members of the Jun family of proteins. Chimeric proteins
consisting of portions of B-ATF and the DNA binding domain of the yeast activator
GAL4 do not stimulate reporter gene expression in mammalian cells, indicating
that B-ATF does not contain a conventional transcription activation domain.
Jun/B-ATF dimers display similar DNA binding profiles as Jun/Fos dimers, with a
bias toward binding TRE (12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate-response element)
over CRE (cyclic AMP-response element) DNA sites. B-ATF inhibits transcriptional 
activation of a reporter gene containing TRE sites in a dose-dependent manner,
presumably by competing with Fos for Jun and forming transcriptionally inert
Jun/B-ATF heterodimers. Stable expression of B-ATF in C3H10T1/2 cells does not
reduce cell viability, but does result in a reduced cellular growth rate when
compared to controls. This effect is dominant in the presence of the growth
promoting effects of the H-Ras or the v-Fos oncoproteins, since expression of
B-ATF restricts the efficiency of focus formation by these transforming agents.
These findings demonstrate that B-ATF is a tissue-specific transcription factor
with the potential to function as a dominant-negative to AP-1.

Multicellular organisms achieve the spatial and temporal regulation of genes
during growth and development through the differential expression of
transcription factors that associate in various combinations. In this paper, we
report the physical association of B-ATF, a member of the AP1 family of basic
leucine zipper transcription factors, with IFP 35, a leucine zipper protein that 
is translocated to the nucleus following the treatment of cells with interferons 
and for which no binding partners previously have been described. Our data
suggest that the formation of B-ATF:IFP 35 heterodimers is an
interferon-inducible event in specialized cell types expressing both proteins and
that changes in AP1 mediated gene transcription likely play a role in the
response of these cells to interferons.

SFA-2, a novel bZIP transcription factor induced by human T-cell leukemia virus
type I, is highly expressed in mature lymphocytes.

A novel cellular gene, SFA-2, was isolated by differential hybridization of a
cDNA library, using probes obtained from an adult T-cell leukemia cell line in
comparison with normal CD4+ T cells and MOLT-4 cell line. The mRNA of the SFA-2
gene is approximately 0.9-kb in size and encodes a protein of 125 amino acids,
containing a basic region-leucine zipper DNA-binding domain. The N-terminal
region of SFA-2 is rich in serine and contains a consensus sequence for casein
kinase II phosphorylation. The SFA-2 gene was strongly expressed in mature T and 
B lymphocytes, and was up-regulated after transformation by human T-cell leukemia
virus type I. The SFA-2 did not homodimerize efficiently but formed heterodimer
preferentially with c-Jun. The SFA-2/c-Jun heterodimer bound preferentially to
the AP-1 and CRE sites.

B-ATF: a novel human bZIP protein that associates with members of the AP-1
transcription factor family.

A new member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, called B-ATF, has
been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from Epstein-Barr virus stimulated
human B cells. B-ATF is a 125 amino acid nuclear protein possessing a basic
leucine zipper domain that is most similar to the basic leucine zipper of ATF-3. 
Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated mRNA isolated from a variety of human
tissues and established cell lines indicates that the 1.0 kilobase B-ATF mRNA is 
expressed differentially, with the strongest hybridization detected in lung and
in Raji Burkitt's lymphoma. Efficient homodimerization of the B-ATF protein
cannot be detected using the yeast two hybrid system or using in vitro binding
assays with glutathione-s-transferase-B-ATF and maltose binding protein-B-ATF
fusion proteins produced in E. coli. However, a yeast two hybrid library screen
has identified the human oncoprotein JunB as a specific binding partner for
B-ATF. Glutathione-s-transferase-B-ATF heterodimerizes efficiently with in vitro 
translated JunB, c-Jun, and JunD, but only weakly associates with c-Fos. In
addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that a B-ATF/c-Jun
protein complex can interact with DNA containing a consensus binding site for
AP-1, suggesting that B-ATF functions as a tissue-specific modulator of the AP-1 
transcription complex in human cells.

An analysis of the relationship between central aortic and peripheral upper limb 
pressure waves in man.

Australia.

Amplification of the pressure pulse between central and peripheral arteries
renders pressure values in the upper limb an inaccurate measure of ascending
aortic (AA) pressure. Accuracy could be improved by allowance for such
amplification. Transfer functions (TF) for pressures between AA and brachial
artery (BA):(BATF) and between AA and radial artery (RA):(RATF) were derived from
high-fidelity pressure recordings obtained at cardiac catheterization in 14
patients under control conditions, and after sublingual nitroglycerine 0.3 mg.
There was no significant difference in BATF under control conditions and with
nitroglycerine; hence results were pooled. Control and nitroglycerine results
were also pooled to obtain a single RATF. BATF and RATF moduli peaked at 5 Hz and
4 Hz, reaching 2.5 and 2.8 times the value at zero frequency respectively.
Frequency-dependent changes in modulus and phase of BATF and RATF were
attributable to wave travel and reflection in the upper limb. BATF and RATF were 
compared to published transfer functions and those derived from analysis of
aortic and brachial or radial pressure waves in previous publications. Results
were similar. Our BATF and RATF were used to synthesize AA pressure waves from
published peripheral pulses. Correspondence was close, especially for systolic
pressure which differed by 2.4 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SEM) mmHg, whereas recorded
systolic pressure differed by 20.4 +/- 2.6 (mean +/- SEM) mmHg between central
and peripheral sites. Results indicate that in adult humans a single generalized 
TF can be used with acceptable accuracy to determine central from peripheral
pressure under different conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
