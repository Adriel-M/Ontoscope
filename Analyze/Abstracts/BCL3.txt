Tight junctions (TJs) play an important role in maintaining the mucosal barrier
function and gastrointestinal health of animals. Lactobacillus plantarum (L.
plantarum) was reported to protect the intestinal barrier function of
early-weaned piglets against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88
challenge; however, the underlying cellular mechanism of this protection was
unclear. Here, an established intestinal porcine epithelia cell (IPEC-J2) model
was used to investigate the protective effects and related mechanisms of L.
plantarum on epithelial barrier damages induced by ETEC K88. Epithelial
permeability, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and abundance of TJ proteins,
were determined. Pre-treatment with L. plantarum for 6h prevented the reduction
in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (P<0.05), inhibited the increased
transcript abundances of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a)
(P<0.05), decreased expression of claudin-1, occludin and zonula occludens (ZO-1)
(P<0.05) and protein expression of occludin (P<0.05) of IPEC-J2 cells caused by
ETEC K88. Moreover, the mRNA expression of negative regulators of toll-like
receptors (TLRs) [single Ig Il-1-related receptor (SIGIRR), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3
(Bcl3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1)] in IPEC-J2
cells pre-treated with L. plantarum were higher (P<0.05) compared with those in
cells just exposed to K88. Furthermore, L. plantarum was shown to regulate
proteins of nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling pathways. These results indicated that L. plantarum may improve
epithelial barrier function by maintenance of TEER, inhibiting the reduction of
TJ proteins, and reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by 
ETEC K88, possibly through modulation of TLRs, NF-<U+03BA>B and MAPK pathways.

Bcl-3 is a member of the I<U+03BA>B family of proteins and an important regulator of
Nuclear Factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B activity. The ability of Bcl-3 to bind and regulate
specific NF-<U+03BA>B dimers has been studied in great depth, but its physiological
roles in vivo are still not fully understood. It is, however, becoming clear that
Bcl-3 is essential for the proper development, survival and activity of adaptive 
immune cells. Bcl-3 dysregulation can be observed in a number of autoimmune
pathologies, and Bcl3-deficient animals are more susceptible to bacterial and
parasitic infection. This review will describe our current understanding of the
roles played by Bcl-3 in the development and regulation of the adaptive immune
response, including lymphoid organogenesis, immune tolerance, lymphocyte function
and dendritic cell biology.

The direct growth of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by industrially scalable
methods is of broad interest for spintronic and nanoelectronic device
applications. Such applications often require atomically precise control of film 
thickness and azimuthal registry between layers and substrate. We report the
formation, by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), of multilayer h-BN(0001) films (up to 7
monolayers) on Co(0001). The ALE process employs BCl3/NH3 cycles at 600 K
substrate temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy
electron diffraction (LEED) data show that this process yields an increase in
h-BN average film thickness linearly proportional to the number of BCl3/NH3
cycles, with BN layers in azimuthal registry with each other and with the
Co(0001) substrate. LEED diffraction spot profile data indicate an average BN
domain size of at least 1900 Å. Optical microscopy data indicate the presence of 
some domains as large as ~20 µm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
ambient exposure studies demonstrate macroscopic and microscopic continuity of
the h-BN film, with the h-BN film highly conformal to the Co substrate.
Photoemission data show that the h-BN(0001) film is p-type, with band bending
near the Co/h-BN interface. Growth of graphene by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is
observed on the surface of multilayer h-BN(0001) at temperatures of 800 K. LEED
data indicate azimuthal graphene alignment with the h-BN and Co(0001) lattices,
with domain size similar to BN. The evidence of multilayer BN and graphene
azimuthal alignment with the lattice of the Co(0001) substrate demonstrates that 
this procedure is suitable for scalable production of heterojunctions for
spintronic applications.

The ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis is dictated by a shift in the
balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic gene expression programs. Monocyte
chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) is a zinc-finger RNA binding
protein with important roles in mediating inflammatory responses. Overexpression 
of MCPIP1 in different cancer cell types has been implicated in eliciting an
antitumor response, but a direct role of MCPIP1 in apoptosis has not been
established. In this study, we demonstrate that MCPIP1 functions as a potent
tumor suppressor that induces apoptosis of breast tumor cells by selectively
enhancing mRNA decay of antiapoptotic gene transcripts, including Bcl2L1, Bcl2A1,
RelB, Birc3, and Bcl3. Mechanistically, MCPIP1 physically interacted with a
stem-loop structure in the 3' untranslated region of these transcripts through
its PIN domain, causing mRNA destabilization. Furthermore, we found that MCPIP1
expression was repressed in breast tumor cells, and overexpression of MCPIP1
induced apoptosis, whereas its depletion enhanced cancer cell proliferation.
Moreover, MCPIP1 induction in vivo resulted in complete regression of established
tumors and a significant reduction in metastatic disease. Notably, low MCPIP1
expression in tumor samples from breast cancer patients was strongly associated
with poor survival over 13 years of follow-up. Collectively, our results
highlight that MCPIP1 is a new tumor suppressor in breast cancer that induces
cell death by tipping the balance in favor of proapoptotic gene expression.

Though Active on RINm5F Insulinoma Cells and Cultured Pancreatic Islets,
Recombinant IL-22 Fails to Modulate Cytotoxicity and Disease in a Protocol of
Streptozotocin-Induced Experimental Diabetes.

Interleukin (IL)-22 is a cytokine displaying tissue protective and
pro-regenerative functions in various preclinical disease models. Anti-bacterial,
pro-proliferative, and anti-apoptotic properties mediated by activation of the
transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3
are key to biological functions of this IL-10 family member. Herein, we introduce
RINm5F insulinoma cells as rat ß-cell line that, under the influence of IL-22,
displays activation of STAT3 with induction of its downstream gene targets Socs3,
Bcl3, and Reg3b. In addition, IL-22 also activates STAT1 in this cell type. To
refine those observations, IL-22 biological activity was evaluated using ex vivo 
cultivated murine pancreatic islets. In accord with data on RINm5F cells, islet
exposure to IL-22 activated STAT3 and upregulation of STAT3-inducible Socs3,
Bcl3, and Steap4 was evident under those conditions. As these observations
supported the hypothesis that IL-22 may exert protective functions in toxic
ß-cell injury, application of IL-22 was investigated in murine multiple-low-dose 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. For that purpose, recombinant IL-22 was
administered thrice either immediately before and at disease onset (at d4, d6,
d8) or closely thereafter (at d8, d10, d12). These two IL-22-treatment periods
coincide with two early peaks of ß-cell injury detectable in this model. Notably,
none of the two IL-22-treatment strategies affected diabetes incidence or blood
glucose levels in STZ-treated mice. Moreover, pathological changes in islet
morphology analyzed 28 days after disease induction were not ameliorated by IL-22
administration. Taken together, despite being active on rat RINm5F insulinoma
cells and murine pancreatic islets, recombinant IL-22 fails to protect pancreatic
ß-cells in the tested protocols from toxic effects of STZ and thus is unable to
ameliorate disease in the widely used model of STZ-induced diabetes.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to predict key genes associated with acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) by bioinformatics analysis.
METHODS: The microarray data of GSE48060, including peripheral blood samples from
31 first-time AMI patients within 48-h post-MI and 21 normal controls, were
obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) in AMI samples compared with normal controls were identified.
Functional enrichment analysis was then performed, followed by analysis of
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and transcription regulatory network
(TRN).
RESULTS: A total of 385 up- and 504 down-regulated DEGs were identified. They
were mainly enriched in five pathways, such as natural killer (NK) cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity and chemokine signaling pathway. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5
(CCL5) was hub protein in PPI network. Besides, four transcription factors (TFs),
including nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group C, member 2 (NR2C2), MYC-associated
factor X (MAX), general transcription factor IIIC, polypeptide 2, beta 110 kDa
(GTF3C2), and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3 (BCL3), were identified. Notably, nuclear
receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) interacted with GTF3C2 and MAX directly.
CONCLUSIONS: CCL5, BCL3, NR2C2, MAX, GTF3C2, and NCOA7 might play important roles
in AMI development.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disease
characterized by multiple recurring clonal cytogenetic anomalies and is the most 
common leukemia in adults. Chromosomal abnormalities associated with CLL include 
trisomy 12 and IGH;BCL3 rearrangement [t(14;19)(q32;q13)] that juxtaposes a
proto-oncogenic gene BCL3 and an immunoglobulin heavy chain, a translocation that
may be associated with shorter survival. In addition to the IGH;BCL3
rearrangement, other translocations involving 14q32 locus are involved in various
lymphoproliferative pathologies pointing toward the significance of IGH locus in 
oncogenic progression. Significantly, in the majority of B-cell neoplasms that
carry an IGH;BCL3 rearrangement, it is a sole translocation involving an IGH
locus.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient who, in addition to trisomy 12, carried a 
rare double-hit translocation characterized by the IGH;BCL3 translocation and an 
additional clonal IGH;BCL2 translocation involving IGH and another proto-oncogene
BCL2, t(14;18)(q32;q21), commonly found in follicular lymphoma. Further single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based analysis detected a duplication of the 
58.8 kb region at 19q13.32 adjacent to the BCL3 translocation junction on
chromosome 19q13. Interestingly, the duplicated region contained ERCC2 gene,
which encodes a DNA excision repair protein involved in the cancer-prone
syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together our findings indicate the existence of
double-translocation driven oncogenic events involving both IGH loci and
proto-oncogenes BCL2 and BCL3. Importantly, the IGH;BCL3 translocation was
characterized by the duplication of the genomic region adjacent to BCL3,
containing a major DNA repair factor, ERCC2.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Under conditions of inflammation in the absence of
micro-organisms (sterile inflammation), necrotic cells release damage-associated 
molecular patterns that bind to Toll-like receptors on immune cells to activate a
signaling pathway that involves activation of I<U+03BA>B kinase and nuclear factor <U+03BA>B
(NF-<U+03BA>B). Little is known about the mechanisms that control NF-<U+03BA>B activity during 
sterile inflammation. We analyzed the contribution of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3
(BCL3), a transcription factor that associates with NF-<U+03BA>B, in control of sterile 
inflammation in the pancreas and biliary system of mice.
METHODS: Acute pancreatitis (AP) was induced in C57BL/6 (control) and Bcl3(-/-)
mice by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein or pancreatic infusion of sodium
taurocholate. We also studied Mdr2(-/-) mice, which develop spontaneous biliary
inflammation, as well as Bcl3(-/-)Mdr2(-/-) mice. We performed
immunohistochemical analyses of inflamed and noninflamed regions of pancreatic
tissue from patients with AP or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as well as 
from mice. Immune cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis. Control or Bcl3(-/-) mice were irradiated, injected with bone marrow
from Bcl3(-/-) or control mice, and AP was induced.
RESULTS: Pancreatic or biliary tissues from patients with AP or PSC had higher
levels of BCL3 and phosphorylated RelA and I<U+03BA>Ba in inflamed vs noninflamed
regions. Levels of BCL3 were higher in pancreata from control mice given cerulein
than from mice without AP, and were higher in biliary tissues from Mdr2(-/-) mice
than from control mice. Bcl3(-/-) mice developed more severe AP after
administration of cerulein or sodium taurocholate than control mice; pancreata
from the Bcl3(-/-) mice with AP had greater numbers of macrophages,
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, and granulocytes than control 
mice with AP. Activation of NF-<U+03BA>B was significantly prolonged in Bcl3(-/-) mice
with AP, compared with control mice with AP. Bcl3(-/-)Mdr2(-/-) mice developed
more severe cholestasis and had increased markers of liver injury and increased
proliferation of biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes than Mdr2(-/-) mice. In
experiments with bone marrow chimeras, expression of BCL3 by acinar cells, but
not myeloid cells, was required for reduction of inflammation during development 
of AP. BCL3 inhibited ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of p50
homodimers, which prolonged binding of NF-<U+03BA>B heterodimers to DNA.
CONCLUSIONS: BCL3 is up-regulated in inflamed pancreatic or biliary tissues from 
mice and patients with AP or cholangitis. Its production appears to reduce the
inflammatory response in these tissues via blocking ubiquitination and
proteasome-mediated degradation of p50 homodimers.

We report that 2,6-lutidine·trichloroborane (Lut·BCl3 ) reacts with H2 in
toluene, bromobenzene, dichloromethane, and Lut solvents producing the neutral
hydride, Lut·BHCl2 . The mechanism was modeled with density functional theory,
and energies of stationary states were calculated at the G3(MP2)B3 level of
theory. Lut·BCl3 was calculated to react with H2 and form the ion pair, [LutH(+) 
][HBCl3 (-) ], with a barrier of <U+0394>H(<U+2260>) =24.7 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1) (<U+0394>G(<U+2260>)
=29.8 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1) ). Metathesis with a second molecule of Lut·BCl3 produced
Lut·BHCl2 and [LutH(+) ][BCl4 (-) ]. The overall reaction is exothermic by
6.0 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1) (<U+0394>r G°=-1.1). Alternate pathways were explored involving the
borenium cation (LutBCl2 (+) ) and the four-membered boracycle [(CH2 {NC5 H3
Me})BCl2 ]. Barriers for addition of H2 across the Lut/LutBCl2 (+) pair and the
boracycle B<U+F8FF>C bond are substantially higher (<U+0394>G(<U+2260>) =42.1 and 49.4 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1) , 
respectively), such that these pathways are excluded. The barrier for addition of
H2 to the boracycle B<U+F8FF>N bond is comparable (<U+0394>H(<U+2260>) =28.5 and <U+0394>G(<U+2260>)
=32 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1) ). Conversion of the intermediate 2-(BHCl2 CH2 )-6-Me(C5 H3 NH) 
to Lut·BHCl2 may occur by intermolecular steps involving proton/hydride transfers
to Lut/BCl3 . Intramolecular protodeboronation, which could form Lut·BHCl2
directly, is prohibited by a high barrier (<U+0394>H(<U+2260>) =52, <U+0394>G(<U+2260>) =51 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1) ).

The reactions of dipyridylmethane (dpma) with group 13 trichlorides were
investigated in 1<U+2009>:<U+2009>1 and 1<U+2009>:<U+2009>2 molar ratios using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
crystallography. With 1<U+2009>:<U+2009>1 stoichiometry and Et2O as solvent, reactions
employing AlCl3 or GaCl3 gave mixtures of products with the salt
[(dpma)2MCl2](+)[MCl4](-) (M = Al, Ga) as the main species. The corresponding
reactions in 1<U+2009>:<U+2009>2 molar ratio gave similar mixtures but with
[(dpma)MCl2](+)[MCl4](-) as the primary product. Pure salts
[(dpma)AlCl2](+)[Cl](-) and [(dpma)AlCl2](+)[AlCl4](-) could be obtained by
performing the reactions in CH3CN. In the case of InCl3, a neutral monoadduct
(dpma)InCl3 formed regardless of the stoichiometry employed. A neutral adduct
(dpma)(BCl3)2 was obtained from the reaction between dpma and BCl3 in Et2O using 
1<U+2009>:<U+2009>2 stoichiometry. With 1<U+2009>:<U+2009>1 molar ratio of reagents, a mixture of products
and deprotonation of the methylene bridge in [(dpma)BCl2](+) was observed. The
experimental data showed that the structural flexibility of the dpma ligand
results in more diverse coordination chemistry with group 13 elements than that
observed for bipyridine (bpy), while computational investigations indicated that 
the investigated metal-ligand interactions are, to a first approximation,
independent of the ligand type. Electrochemical and chemical attempts to reduce
the cations [(dpma)MCl2](+) showed that, in stark contrast to the chemistry of
the related [(bpy)BCl2](+) cation, the neutral radicals [(dpma)MCl2]<U+02D9> are
extremely unstable. Differences in the redox behaviour of dpma and bpy could be
rationalized with the electronic structure of the ligand and that of the
methylene bridge in particular. As a whole, the facile reactivity of the
methylene bridge in the dpma ligand renders it amenable to further reactivity and
functionalization that is not possible in the case of bpy.

Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a rare autosomal dominant
disorder that is due, in large measure, to aberrant Shh signaling driven by
mutations in the tumor suppressor gene Ptch1. Here, we describe the development
of Ptch1+/-/ SKH-1 mice as a novel model of this disease. These animals manifest 
many features of NBCCS, including developmental anomalies and are remarkably
sensitive to both ultraviolet (UVB) and ionizing radiation that drive the
development of multiple BCCs. Just as in patients with NBCCS, Ptch1+/-/SKH-1 also
spontaneously develops BCCs and other neoplasms such as
rhabdomyomas/rhabdomyosarcomas. Administration of smoothened inhibitors
(vismodegib/itraconazole/cyclopamine) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(sulindac/sulfasalazine) each result in partial resolution of BCCs in these
animals. However, combined administration of these agents inhibits the growth of 
UVB-induced BCCs by >90%. Employing small molecule- and decoy-peptide-based
approaches we further affirm that complete remission of BCCs could only be
achieved by combined inhibition of p50-NF<U+03BA>B/Bcl3 and Shh signaling. We posit that
Ptch1+/-/SKH-1 mice are a novel and relevant animal model for NBCCS.
Understanding mechanisms that govern genetic predisposition to BCCs should
facilitate our ability to identify and treat NBCCS gene carriers, including those
at risk for sporadic BCCs while accelerating development of novel therapeutic
modalities for these patients.

The free cyclohexasilane Si6Cl12 (1) was obtained in 66% yield from the
corresponding Cl(-) diadduct [nBu4N]2[1·2Cl] and AlCl3 in C6H6. The substituted
cyclohexasilane 1,1-(Cl3Si)2Si6Cl10 (2), however, cannot be liberated from
[nBu4N]2[2·2Cl] under comparable reaction conditions. Instead, a mixture of
several products was obtained, from which the oligosilane Si19Cl36 (3)
crystallized in low yields. X-ray crystallography revealed 3 to consist of two
Si5 rings, bridged by one silicon atom. Compound 1 possesses Lewis acidic sites
above and below the ring centroid. Competition experiments reveal that their
corresponding acid strengths are comparable to that of BCl3. The reaction of 1
with 6 equiv of 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (Idipp) leads to
a complete breakdown of the cyclic scaffold and furnishes the dichlorosilylene
adduct Idipp-SiCl2.

A direct and catalyst-free method for the intramolecular aminoboration of
unfunctionalized olefins is reported. In the presence of BCl3 (1 equiv) as the
sole boron source, intramolecular aminoboration of sulfonamide derivatives of
4-penten-1-amines, 5-hexen-1-amines, and 2-allylanilines proceeded readily
without the use of any catalyst. The boronic acids obtained after hydrolysis
could be converted into the corresponding pinacol borates in a straightforward
manner by treatment with pinacol under anhydrous conditions.

The bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV-1) is a pathogen responsible for high
economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. This virus has the capacity to 
modulate the immune system of several higher vertebrates, but there is little
information available on the cell infection mechanism. To further investigate the
effects of BVDV-1 on the activation of the immune response, the Madin-Darby
bovine kidney cell line was infected with the cytopathic CH001 field isolate of
BVDV-1, and the proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine expression profiles were
analyzed. The results showed that BVDV-1 was able to induce the production of
BCL3, IL-1ß, IL-8, IL-15, IL-18, Mx-1, IRF-1, and IRF-7 in a way similar to
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Interestingly, all BVDV-1 activities were
blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway. These
results, together with in silico analyses showing the presence of several
regulatory consensus target motifs, suggest that BVDV-1 regulates gene expression
in bovines through the activation of several key transcription factors.
Collectively, these data identified BVDV-1 as a viral regulator of immune marker 
expression, even from early infection. Additionally, this is the first report to 
find BVDV-1 modulating the activation of cytokine production and transcriptions
factors mainly through the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway in vertebrates.

bis(phosphinimino)amide, LBH2 (), (L = [N(Ph2PN(2,4,6-Me3C6H2))2](-)) with 3
equivalents of BH2Cl·SMe2 or one equivalent of BCl3 affords the first stable
monohydridoborenium ion, [LBH](+)[HBCl3](-) () that is stable without a weakly
coordinating bulky anion. Compound can also be prepared directly by refluxing LH 
with 3 equivalents of BH2Cl·SMe2. Interestingly, reaction of LBH2 () with
elemental sulfur and selenium involves oxidative addition of S and Se into B-H
bonds and subsequent release of H2S (or H2Se) from the intermediate LB(SH)2 (or
LB(SeH)2) species forming stable compounds with terminal boron-chalcogen double
bonds LB[double bond, length as m-dash]S () and LB[double bond, length as
m-dash]Se (). The electronic structures of compounds , and were elucidated by
high resolution mass spectrometry, multi-nuclear NMR and single crystal X-ray

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)
pluripotency through STAT3 activation, but the downstream signaling remains
largely unelucidated. Using cDNA microarrays, we verified B cell
leukemia/lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) as the most significantly downregulated factor
following LIF withdrawal in mESCs. Bcl3 knockdown altered mESC morphology,
reduced expression of pluripotency genes including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, and
downregulated DNA binding of acetylated histone 3 and RNA polymerase II on the
Oct4 promoter. Conversely, Bcl3 overexpression partially prevented cell
differentiation and promoted Oct4 and Nanog promoter activities. Furthermore,
coimmunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated 
that Bcl3 regulation of mESC pluripotency may be through its association with
Oct4 and ß-catenin and its promoter binding capability. These results establish
that Bcl3 positively regulates pluripotency genes and thus shed light on the
mechanism of Bcl3 as a downstream molecule of LIF/STAT3 signaling in pluripotency
maintenance. Stem Cells 2015;33:3468-3480.

The oxidative addition of BF3 to a platinum(0) bis(phosphine) complex [Pt(PMe3)2]
(1) was investigated by density functional calculations. Both the cis and trans
pathways for the oxidative addition of BF3 to 1 are endergonic (<U+0394>G°=26.8 and
35.7 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1), respectively) and require large Gibbs activation energies
(<U+0394>G°(<U+2260>)=56.3 and 38.9 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1), respectively). A second borane plays crucial 
roles in accelerating the activation; the trans oxidative addition of BF3 to 1 in
the presence of a second BF3 molecule occurs with <U+0394>G°(<U+2260>) and <U+0394>G° values of 10.1
and -4.7 kcal<U+2009>mol(-1), respectively. <U+0394>G°(<U+2260>) becomes very small and <U+0394>G° becomes
negative. A charge transfer (CT), F<U+2192>BF3, occurs from the dissociating fluoride to
the second non-coordinated BF3. This CT interaction stabilizes both the
transition state and the product. The B-F s-bond cleavage of BF2Ar(F)
(Ar(F)=3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) and the B-Cl s-bond cleavage of BCl3 by 1 
are accelerated by the participation of the second borane. The calculations
predict that trans oxidative addition of SiF4 to 1 easily occurs in the presence 
of a second SiF4 molecule via the formation of a hypervalent Si species.

Cancer-driven granulo-monocytopoiesis stimulates expansion of tumor promoting
myeloid populations, mostly myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We identified subsets of MDSCs and TAMs
based on the expression of retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (RORC1/ROR<U+03B3>) in 
human and mouse tumor bearers. RORC1 orchestrates myelopoiesis by suppressing
negative (Socs3 and Bcl3) and promoting positive (C/EBPß) regulators of
granulopoiesis, as well as the key transcriptional mediators of myeloid
progenitor commitment and differentiation to the monocytic/macrophage lineage
(IRF8 and PU.1). RORC1 supported tumor-promoting innate immunity by protecting
MDSCs from apoptosis, mediating TAM differentiation and M2 polarization, and
limiting tumor infiltration by mature neutrophils. Accordingly, ablation of RORC1
in the hematopoietic compartment prevented cancer-driven myelopoiesis, resulting 
in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.

BCl3 is an inexpensive electrophile which induces the borylative cyclization of a
wide range of substituted alkynes to regioselectively form polycycles containing 
synthetically versatile C(sp(2) )<U+F8FF>boronate esters. It proceeds rapidly, with good
yields and is compatible with a range of functional groups and substitution
patterns. Intermolecular 1,2-carboboration of alkynes is also achieved using BCl3
to generate trisubstituted vinyl boronate esters.

INTRODUCTION: Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) significantly improve
tissue repair by providing regeneration potential within injured cardiovascular
tissue. However, ECFC transplantation into ischemic tissue exhibits limited
therapeutic efficacy due to poor engraftment in vivo. We established an adequate 
ex vivo expansion protocol and identified novel modulators that enhance
functional bioactivities of ECFCs.
METHODS: To augment the regenerative potential of ECFCs, functional bioactivities
of hypoxia-preconditioned ECFCs (hypo-ECFCs) were examined.
RESULTS: Phosphorylations of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and clonogenic proliferation 
were enhanced by short-term ECFC culturing under hypoxia, whereas siRNA-targeting
of STAT3 significantly reduced these activities. Expression of BCL3, a target
molecule of STAT3, was increased in hypo-ECFCs. Moreover, siRNA inhibition of
BCL3 markedly reduced survival of ECFCs during hypoxic stress in vitro and
ischemic stress in vivo. In a hindlimb ischemia model of ischemia, hypo-ECFC
transplantation enhanced blood flow ratio, capillary density, transplanted cell
proliferation and survival, and angiogenic cytokine secretion at ischemic sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia preconditioning facilitates functional bioactivities of
ECFCs by mediating regulation of the STAT3-BCL3 axis. Thus, a hypoxic
preconditioned ex vivo expansion protocol triggers expansion and functional
bioactivities of ECFCs via modulation of the hypoxia-induced STAT3-BCL3 axis,
suggesting that hypo-ECFCs offer a therapeutic strategy for accelerated
neovasculogenesis in ischemic diseases.

OBJECTIVES: BCL3, a known atypical I<U+03BA>B family member, has been documented to be
upregulated in hematological malignancies and in some solid tumors, functioning
as a crucial player in tumor development. Recently, rs8100239, a tag-Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in BCL3 (T>A) has been identified, but there are no
data regarding its involvement in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) initiation
and progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the possible association of BCL3 with NSCLC, 268 
patients and 279 healthy controls were genotyped for rs8100239. Moreover, BCL3
protein expression was also investigated in 112 NSCLC cases through an
immunohistochemical analysis.
RESULTS: NSCLC patients with AA genotype displayed significantly worse prognosis 
compared to T allele carriers (P<0.001), who had less frequent intermediate
nuclear BCL3 expression (P=0.042). In addition, overexpression of BCL3 was
detected in tumor specimens, compared to normal tissue (P<0.001). Furthermore,
BCL3 protein levels were associated with five-year survival (P=0.039), maximum
diameter of lesion (P=0.012), grade (P=0.002) and relapse frequency (P=0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to show a relationship between the
genetic variation rs8100239 of BCL3 and cancer patients' survival. It also
represents the first quantitative evaluation of BCL3 expression in NSCLC. Our
findings indicate that rs8100239 may be considered as a novel prognostic
indicator, demonstrating also the overexpression of BCL3 protein in NSCLC and
implicating this pivotal molecule in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.

The transcription factor nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF<U+03BA>B) is a central regulator of
inflammation, and genome-wide association studies in subjects with autoimmune
disease have identified a number of variants within the NF<U+03BA>B signaling cascade.
In addition, causal variant fine-mapping has demonstrated that autoimmune disease
susceptibility variants for multiple sclerosis (MS) and ulcerative colitis are
strongly enriched within binding sites for NF<U+03BA>B. We report that MS-associated
variants proximal to NF<U+03BA>B1 and in an intron of TNFRSF1A (TNFR1) are associated
with increased NF<U+03BA>B signaling after tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) stimulation.
Both variants result in increased degradation of inhibitor of NF<U+03BA>B a (I<U+03BA>Ba), a
negative regulator of NF<U+03BA>B, and nuclear translocation of p65 NF<U+03BA>B. The variant
proximal to NF<U+03BA>B1 controls signaling responses by altering the expression of NF<U+03BA>B
itself, with the GG risk genotype expressing 20-fold more p50 NF<U+03BA>B and diminished
expression of the negative regulators of the NF<U+03BA>B pathway: TNFa-induced protein 3
(TNFAIP3), B cell leukemia 3 (BCL3), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1
(CIAP1). Finally, naïve CD4 T cells from patients with MS express enhanced
activation of p65 NF<U+03BA>B. These results demonstrate that genetic variants
associated with risk of developing MS alter NF<U+03BA>B signaling pathways, resulting in
enhanced NF<U+03BA>B activation and greater responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. As
such, this suggests that rapid genetic screening for variants associated with
NF<U+03BA>B signaling may identify individuals amenable to NF<U+03BA>B or cytokine blockade.

OBJECTIVE: To describe gene expression in murine chondrocytes stimulated with
IL-6 family cytokines and the impact of deleting Suppressor of Cytokine
Signaling-3 (SOCS-3) in this cell type.
METHOD: Primary chondrocytes were isolated from wild type and SOCS-3-deficient
(Socs3(<U+0394>/<U+0394>col2)) mice and stimulated with oncostatin M (OSM), IL-6 plus the
soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6/sIL-6R), IL-11 or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
for 4 h. Total RNA was extracted and gene expression was evaluated by microarray 
analysis. Validation of the microarray results was performed using Taqman probes 
on RNA derived from chondrocytes stimulated for 1, 2, 4 or 8 h. Gene ontology was
characterized using DAVID (database for annotation, visualization and integrated 
discovery).
RESULTS: Multiple genes, including Bcl3, Junb, Tgm1, Angptl4 and Lrg1, were
upregulated in chondrocytes stimulated with each gp130 cytokine. The gene
transcription profile in response to OSM stimulation was pro-inflammatory and was
highly correlated to IL-6/sIL-6R, rather than IL-11 or LIF. In the absence of
SOCS-3, OSM and IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation induced an interferon (IFN)-like gene
signature, including expression of IL-31ra and S100a9.
CONCLUSION: While each gp130 cytokine induced a transcriptional response in
chondrocytes, OSM- and IL-6/sIL-6R were the most potent members of this cytokine 
family. SOCS-3 plays an important regulatory role in this cell type, as it does
in hematopoietic cells. Our results provide new insights into a hierarchy of
gp130-induced transcriptional responses in chondrocytes that is normally
restrained by SOCS-3 and suggest therapeutic inhibition of OSM may have benefit
over and above antagonism of IL-6 during inflammatory arthritis.

miR-125b.

miR-125b has essential roles in coordinating tumor proliferation, angiogenesis,
invasiveness, metastasis and chemotherapy recurrence. In ovarian cancer miR-125b 
has been shown to be downregulated and acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting
proto-oncogene BCL3. PPAR<U+03B3>, a multiple functional transcription factor, has been 
reported to have anti-tumor effects through inhibition of proliferation and
induction of differentiation and apoptosis by targeting the tumor related genes. 
However, it is unclear whether miR-125b is regulated by PPAR<U+03B3> in ovarian cancer. 
In this study, we demonstrated that the miR-125b downregulated in ovarian cancer 
tissues and cell lines. Ligands-activated PPAR<U+03B3> suppressed proliferation of
ovarian cancer cells and this PPAR<U+03B3>-induced growth inhibition is mediated by the 
upregulation of miR-125b. PPAR<U+03B3> promoted the expression of miR-125b by directly
binding to the responsive element in miR-125b gene promoter region. Thus, our
results suggest that PPAR<U+03B3> can induce growth suppression of ovarian cancer by
upregulating miR-125b which inhibition of proto-oncogene BCL3. These findings
will extend our understanding of the function of PPAR<U+03B3> in tumorigenesis and
miR-125b may be a therapeutic intervention of ovarian cancer.

The effect of inductively-coupled-plasma reactive ion etching power on the
etching rate and the surface roughness of a sapphire substrate.

Chang CM, Shiao MH, Yang CT, Cheng CT, Hsueh WJ.

In this study, patterned sapphire substrates are fabricated using nanosphere
lithography (NSL) and inductively-coupled-plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE). 
Polystyrene nanospheres of approximately 600 nm diameter are self-assembled on
c-plane sapphire substrates by spin-coating. The diameter of the polystyrene
nanospheres is modified to adjust the etching mask pitch cycle using oxygen
plasma in the ICP-RIE system. A nickel thin film mask of 100 nm thickness is
deposited by electron-beam evaporation on a substrate covered with treated
nanospheres. The sapphire substrate is then etched in an inductively coupled
plasma system using BCl3/Ar gas, to fabricate a structure with a periodic
sub-micron hole array with different sidewall intervals. The DC bias voltage, the
sapphire etching rate, the surface roughness, are studied as a function of the
ICP and the RF power. Different sub-micron hole arrays with spacing cycles of 89 
nm, 139 nm and 167 nm are successfully fabricated on the sapphire substrate,
using suitable etching parameters.

InAsSb/InAsPSb multiple quantum well disk cavities with pedestal structures on a 
GaSb substrate for mid-infrared whispering-gallery-mode emission beyond 4<U+2009><U+2009>µm.

Lin YC, Mao MH, Wu CJ, Lin HH.

The mid-infrared whispering-gallery-mode disk cavities with
InAs0.85Sb0.15/InAs0.53P0.23Sb0.24 multiple quantum wells active medium on a GaSb
substrate were fabricated. For this material system in the mid-infrared range,
fabrication techniques were developed to form the disk cavity structure. The
smooth sidewalls of the disk cavities were achieved by appropriate gas mixture
flow ratio of BCl3/Ar in the inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching. In 
addition, selective wet etching technique was used to form the pedestal of the
disk cavity using dilute hydrofluoric acid with good selectivity. For efficient
confinement of the whispering gallery modes along the radial direction, the
extent of the lateral etching was carefully controlled. The processed
30-µm-diameter disk cavities were optically pumped, and the whispering gallery
modes with wavelengths around 4.1 µm can be observed up to 90 K.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is characterized by transcriptomic
changes that alter cellular processes leading to decreased cardiac output.
Because the molecular network of ICM is largely unknown, the aim of this study
was to characterize the role of new transcriptional regulators in the molecular
mechanisms underlying the responses to ischemia.
METHODS: Myocardial tissue explants from ICM patients and control (CNT) subjects 
were analyzed by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and quantitative Real-Time PCR.
RESULTS: Enrichment analysis of the ICM transcriptomic profile allowed the
characterization of novel master regulators. We found that the expression of the 
transcriptional regulators SP100 (-1.5-fold, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05), CITED2 (-3.8-fold,
p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05), CEBPD (-4.9-fold, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and BCL3 (-3.3-fold, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) were lower 
in ICM than in CNT. To gain insights into the molecular network defined by the
transcription factors, we identified CEBPD, BCL3, and HIF1A target genes in the
RNA-Seq datasets. We further characterized the biological processes of the target
genes by gene ontology annotation. Our results suggest that CEBPD-inducible genes
with roles in the inhibition of apoptosis are downregulated and that
BCL3-repressible genes are involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism in
ICM. Moreover, our results suggest that CITED2 downregulation causes increased
expression of HIF1A target genes. Functional analysis of HIF1A target genes
revealed that hypoxic and stress response genes are activated in ICM. Finally, we
found a significant correlation between the mRNA levels of BCL3 and the mRNA
levels of both CEBPD (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.73, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and CITED2 (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.56, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05).
Interestingly, CITED2 mRNA levels are directly related to ejection fraction (EF) 
(r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.54, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that changes in the expression of SP100, CITED2,
CEBPD, and BCL3 affect their transcription regulatory networks, which
subsequently alter a number of biological processes in ICM patients. The
relationship between CITED2 mRNA levels and EF emphasizes the importance of this 
transcription factor in ICM. Moreover, our findings identify new mechanisms used 
to interpret gene expression changes in ICM and provide valuable resources for
further investigation of the molecular basis of human cardiac ischemic response.

Changes in expression induced by Epstein-Barr Virus LMP1-CTAR1: potential role of
bcl3.

Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. (2)nrt@med.unc.edu.

The Epstein-Barr virus protein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has two NF-<U+03BA>B
activating domains within its intracellular carboxy terminus (carboxy-terminal
activating region 1 [CTAR1] and CTAR2). LMP1-CTAR1 is required for B-lymphocyte
transformation, is capable of transforming rodent fibroblasts, and uniquely
activates phosphoinositol (PI3) kinase, the noncanonical NF-<U+03BA>B pathway, and
expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, the
effects of LMP1-CTAR1 on cellular gene expression were determined by
high-throughput sequencing. Additionally, the binding of bcl3 was determined
using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequencing. LMP1-CTAR1 induced few
changes in transcription with more genes showing decreased expression. Ingenuity 
pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment for genes involved in cancer
and cellular movement, survival, growth, and proliferation pathways. ChIP in
combination with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified bcl3 binding
for more than 2,000 genes in LMP1-CTAR1-expressing cells with more than 90% of
the peaks at genes detected within the probable promoter region. Only a small
subset of the genes with significant changes in expression had corresponding
peaks in the bcl3 ChIP. However, both NFKB2 and PI3 kinase were identified in the
bcl3 ChIP. Additionally, many of the predicted upstream regulators for the
changes in expression were identified in the bcl3 ChIP. Analysis of the proteins 
in the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway revealed many changes identified by the high-throughput RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bcl3 ChIP that would likely activate noncanonical NF-<U+03BA>B 
signaling and possibly inhibit canonical NF-<U+03BA>B signaling. These findings suggest 
that the two LMP1 signaling domains modulate their combined activity and that the
bcl3 transcription factor is likely responsible for some of the unique effects of
CTAR1 on cellular expression.IMPORTANCE: The Epstein-Barr virus protein latent
membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has potent effects on cell growth. LMP1 has two
regions, carboxy-terminal activating region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2, that distinctly 
activate NF-<U+03BA>B, a transcription factor complex involved in activation of
important host genes. In this study, analysis of the effects on cellular gene
expression revealed that CTAR1 significantly affected cellular expression in part
through effects on a specific form of NF-<U+03BA>B. The data suggest that LMP1 can
activate a distinct subset of host gene expression through its CTAR1 domain which
in combination with other signaling effects induced by the CTAR2 domain likely
affects cell movement, survival, and growth.

Applied quantum chemistry: Spectroscopic detection and characterization of the
F2BS and Cl2BS free radicals in the gas phase.

In this and previous work [D. J. Clouthier, J. Chem. Phys. 141, 244309 (2014)],
the spectroscopic signatures of the X2BY (X = H, halogen, Y = O, S) free radicals
have been predicted using high level ab initio theory. The theoretical results
have been used to calculate the electronic absorption and single vibronic level
(SVL) emission spectra of the radicals under typical jet-cooled conditions. Using
these diagnostic predictions, the previously unknown F2BS and Cl2BS free radicals
have been identified and characterized. The radicals were prepared in a free jet 
expansion by subjecting precursor mixtures of BF3 or BCl3 and CS2 vapor to an
electric discharge at the exit of a pulsed molecular beam valve. The
B~(2)A1-X~(2)B2 laser-induced fluorescence spectra were found within 150 cm(-1)
of their theoretically predicted positions with vibronic structure consistent
with our Franck-Condon simulations. The B~(2)A1 state emits down to the ground
state and to the low-lying A~(2)B1 excited state and the correspondence between
the observed and theoretically derived SVL emission Franck-Condon profiles was
used to positively identify the radicals and make assignments. Excited state
Coriolis coupling effects complicate the emission spectra of both radicals. In
addition, a forbidden component of the electronically allowed B~-X~ band system
of Cl2BS is evident, as signaled by the activity in the b2 modes in the spectrum.
Symmetry arguments indicate that this component gains intensity due to a vibronic
interaction of the B~(2)A1 state with a nearby electronic state of (2)B2
symmetry.

Temozolomide is used widely to treat malignant glioma, but the overall response
to this agent is generally poor. Resistance to DNA-damaging drugs such as
temozolomide has been related to the induction of antiapoptotic proteins.
Specifically, the transcription factor NF-<U+03BA>B has been suggested to participate in
promoting the survival of cells exposed to chemotherapy. To identify factors that
modulate cytotoxicity in the setting of DNA damage, we used an unbiased strategy 
to examine the NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent expression profile induced by temozolomide. By
this route, we defined the decoy receptor DcR1 as a temozolomide response gene
induced by a mechanism relying upon p50/NF-<U+03BA>B1. A conserved NF-<U+03BA>B-binding
sequence (<U+03BA>B-site) was identified in the proximal promoter and was demonstrated
to be required for DcR1 induction by temozolomide. Loss-of-function and
gain-of-function studies reveal that the atypical I<U+03BA>B protein, Bcl3, is also
required for induction of DcR1 by temozolomide. Mechanistically, DcR1 attenuates 
temozolomide efficacy by blunting activation of the Fas receptor pathway in
p53(+/+) glioma cells. Intracranial xenograft studies show that DcR1 depletion in
glioma cells enhances the efficacy of temozolomide. Taken together, our results
show how DcR1 upregulation mediates temozolomide resistance and provide a
rationale for DcR1 targeting as a strategy to sensitize gliomas to this widely
used chemotherapy.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism for the
initial step of metastasis. Proteomic analysis indicates that Pirin is involved
in metastasis. However, there are no reports demonstrating its direct
contribution. Here we investigated the involvement of Pirin in EMT. In HeLa
cells, Pirin suppressed E-cadherin expression and regulated the expression of
other EMT markers. Furthermore, cells expressing Pirin exhibited a spindle-like
morphology, which is reminiscent of EMT. A Pirin mutant defective for Bcl3
binding decreased E-cadherin expression similar to wild-type, suggesting that
Pirin regulates E-cadherin independently of Bcl3-Slug signaling. These data
provide direct evidence that Pirin contributes to cancer metastasis.

Patterning of light-extraction nanostructures on sapphire substrates using
nanoimprint and ICP etching with different masking materials.

Chen H(1), Zhang Q, Chou SY.

(1)Nanostructure Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton
University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.

Sapphire nanopatterning is the key solution to GaN light emitting diode (LED)
light extraction. One challenge is to etch deep nanostructures with a vertical
sidewall in sapphire. Here, we report a study of the effects of two masking
materials (SiO2 and Cr) and different etching recipes (the reaction gas ratio,
the reaction pressure and the inductive power) in a chlorine-based (BCl3 and Cl2)
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching of deep nanopillars in sapphire, and the
etching process optimization. The masking materials were patterned by
nanoimprinting. We have achieved high aspect ratio sapphire nanopillar arrays
with a much steeper sidewall than the previous etching methods. We discover that 
the SiO2 mask has much slower erosion rate than the Cr mask under the same
etching condition, leading to the deep cylinder-shaped nanopillars (122 nm
diameter, 200 nm pitch, 170 nm high, flat top, and a vertical sidewall of 80°
angle), rather than the pyramid-shaped shallow pillars (200 nm based diameter, 52
nm height, and 42° sidewall) resulted by using Cr mask. The processes developed
are scalable to large volume LED manufacturing.

Functional nature of a novel mutant CYLD observed in pediatric lymphoblastic
B-cell leukemia.

(1)Departments of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Post-graduate
Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

The Deubiquitinating enzyme, Cylindromatosis (CYLD), has been established as a
crucial regulator of B-cells. The present study was addressed to identify the
nature of CYLD-dependent RNomics in patients of pediatric age group with B-ALL.
The study revealed the presence of a novel mutant CYLD of 55<U+2009>kDa in these
patients. The mutant CYLD displayed its ability to restrict the cells in G2 phase
of cell cycle, down-regulate PLK-1 and block the nuclear translocation of BCL3.
Based upon these results, we propose that this mutant CYLD has the capacity to
act as a differential marker characteristic of B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.

free radicals [S.-G. He, F. X. Sunahori, and D. J. Clouthier, J. Am. Chem. Soc.

emission spectra have been recorded to map out the ground and excited state
vibrational energy levels. The band system involves a linear-bent transition
between the two Renner-Teller components of what would be a (2)<U+03A0> electronic state
at linearity. We have used high level ab initio theory to calculate the ground
and excited state potential energy surfaces and have determined the vibronic
energy levels variationally. The theory results were used to assign the LIF
spectra which involve transitions from the ground state zero-point level to high 
vibrational levels of the excited state. The correspondence between theory and
experiment, including the transition frequencies, upper state band symmetries,
and H, B, and Cl isotope shifts, was used to validate the assignments.

Site and chirality selective chemical modifications of boron nitride nanotubes
(BNNTs) via Lewis acid-base interactions.

The pristine BNNTs contain both Lewis acid (boron) and Lewis base (nitrogen)
centers at their surface. Interactions of ammonia and borane molecules,
representatives of Lewis base and acid as adsorbates respectively, with matching 
sites at the surface of BNNTs, have been explored in the present DFT study.
Adsorption energies suggest stronger chemisorption (about 15-20 kcal mol(-1)) of 
borane than ammonia (about 5-10 kcal mol(-1)) in both armchair (4,4) and zigzag
(8,0) variants of the tube. NH3 favors (8,0) over the (4,4) tube, whereas BH3
exhibits the opposite preference, indicating some chirality dependence on
acid-base interactions. A new feature of bonding is found in BH3/AlH3-BNNTs (at
the edge site) complexes, where one hydrogen of the guest molecule is involved in
three-center two-electron bonding, in addition to dative covalent bond (N: <U+2192> B). 
This interaction causes a reversal of electron flow from borane/alane to BNNT,
making the tube an electron acceptor, suggesting tailoring of electronic
properties could be possible by varying strength of incoming Lewis acids. On the 
contrary, BNNTs always behave as electron acceptor in ammonia complexes. IR, XPS 
and NMR spectra show some characteristic features of complexes and can help
experimentalists to identify not only structures of such complexes but also the
location of the guest molecules and design second functionalizations. Interaction
with several other neutral BF3, BCl3, BH2CH3 and ionic CH3(+) acids as well as
amino group (CH3NH2 and NH2COOH) were also studied. The strongest interaction
(>100 kcal mol(-1)) is found in BNNT-CH3(+) complexes and H-bonds are the only
source of stability of NH2COOH-BNNT complexes.

Bis-mixed-carbene ruthenium-thiolate-alkylidene complexes: synthesis and olefin
metathesis activity.

A series of bis-carbene Ru-hydride species, including (IMes)(Im(OMe)2)(PPh3)RuHCl
(1) and (SIMes)(Me2Im(OMe)2)(PPh3)RuHCl (2) were prepared and subsequently shown 
to react with aryl-vinyl-sulfides to give the bis-carbene-alkylidene complexes:
Im(OMe)2(SIMes)RuCl(SR)(=CHCH3) (R = p-FC6H4 (3), p-(NO2)C6H4 (4)),
Im(OMe)2(IMes)RuCl(=CHCH3)(SPh) (5), Me2Im(OMe)2(SIMes)RuCl(=CHCH3)(SPh) (6),
Im(OMe)2(SIMes)(F5C6S)RuCl(=CHR) (R = C4H9 (9), C5H11 (10)). The activity of
these species in the standard Grubbs' tests for ring-opening metathesis
polymerization, ring-closing and cross-metathesis are reported. Although these
thiolate derivatives are shown to exhibit modest metathesis activities, the
reactivity is enhanced in the presence of BCl3.

This paper reports a complete ammonia borane (AB) regeneration process in which
Bu3SnH was utilized as a reductant for the reductive dechlorination of BCl3, and 
Et2PhN was selected as a 'helper ligand' to generate Et2PhN·BH3, which gives rise
to a high yield of AB by a base-exchange reaction at ambient temperature.

Data with border-line statistical significance, copiously generated in
genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease (CAD), could include
functionally relevant associations. We propose an integrated genomic and
transcriptomic approach for unravelling new potential genetic signatures of
atherosclerosis. Fifteen among 91 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
first selected for association in a sex- and age-adjusted model by examining 510 
patients with CAD and myocardial infarction and 388 subjects with normal coronary
arteries (CAD-free) in the replication stages of a genome-wide association study.
We investigated the expression of 71 genes proximal to the 15 tag-SNPs by two
subsequent steps of microarray-based mRNA profiling, the former in vascular
smooth muscle cell populations, isolated from non-atherosclerotic and
atherosclerotic human carotid portions, and the latter in whole carotid
specimens. BCL3 and PVRL2, contiguously located on chromosome 19, and ABCA1,
extensively investigated before, were found to be differentially expressed. BCL3 
and PVRL2 SNPs were genotyped within a second population of CAD patients (n=442) 
and compared with CAD-free subjects (n=393). The carriership of the BCL3
rs2965169 G allele was more represented among CAD patients and remained
independently associated with CAD after adjustment for all the traditional
cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio=1.70 with 95% confidence interval
1.07-2.71), while the BCL3 rs8100239 A allele correlated with metabolic
abnormalities. The up-regulation of BCL3 mRNA levels in atherosclerotic tissue
samples was consistent with BCL3 protein expression, which was detected by
immunostaining in the intima-media of atherosclerotic specimens, but not within
non-atherosclerotic ones. Our integrated approach suggests a role for BCL3 in
cardiovascular diseases.

The addition of BCl3 to the carbene-transfer reagent NHC<U+2192>SiCl4
(NHC=1,3-dimethylimidazolidin-2-ylidene) gave the tetra- and pentacoordinate
trichlorosilicon(IV) cations [(NHC)SiCl3 ](+) and [(NHC)2 SiCl3 ](+) with
tetrachloroborate as counterion. This is in contrast to previous reactions, in
which NHC<U+2192>SiCl4 served as a transfer reagent for the NHC ligand. The addition of 
BF3 ·OEt2 , on the other hand, gave NHC<U+2192>BF3 as the product of NHC transfer. In
addition, the highly Lewis acidic bis(pentafluoroethyl)silane (C2 F5 )2 SiCl2 was
treated with NHC<U+2192>SiCl4 . In acetonitrile, the cationic silicon(IV) complexes
[(NHC)SiCl3 ](+) and [(NHC)2 SiCl3 ](+) were detected with [(C2 F5 )SiCl3 ](-) as
counterion. A similar result was already reported for the reaction of NHC<U+2192>SiCl4
with (C2 F5 )2 SiH2 , which gave [(NHC)2 SiCl2 H][(C2 F5 )SiCl3 ]. If the
reaction medium was changed to dichloromethane, the products of carbene transfer,
NHC<U+2192>Si(C2 F5 )2 Cl2 and NHC<U+2192>Si(C2 F5 )2 ClH, respectively, were obtained instead.
The formation of the latter species is a result of chloride/hydride metathesis.
These compounds may serve as valuable precursors for electron-poor silylenes.
Furthermore, the reactivity of NHC<U+2192>SiCl4 towards phosphines is discussed. The
carbene complex NHC<U+2192>PCl3 shows similar reactivity to NHC<U+2192>SiCl4 , and may even
serve as a carbene-transfer reagent as well.

An effective solid-state reaction method is reported for synthesizing boron
nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) in large scale and with high purity by annealing
amorphous boron powder and ferric chloride (FeCl3) catalyst in ammonia atmosphere
at elevated temperatures. FeCl3 that has rarely been utilized before is
introduced not only as a catalyst but also as an efficient transforming agent
which converts boron powder into boron chloride (BCl3) vapor in situ. The
nanotubes are bamboo in shape and have an average diameter of about 90 nm. The
effect of synthetic temperatures on nanotube morphology and yield is
investigated. The photoluminescence (PL) measurement shows emission bands of the 
nanotubes at 354, 423, 467, and 666 nm. A combined growth mechanism of
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) and solid-liquid-solid (SLS) model is proposed for the
formation of the BNNTs.

syn-1,2-carboboration of alkynes with borenium cations.

Cade IA(1), Ingleson MJ.

Author information: 
(1)School of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester,
M13 9PL (UK).

The reaction of 8-(trimethylsiloxy)quinoline (QOTMS) with BCl3 and (aryl)BCl2
forms QOBCl2 and QOBCl(aryl). The subsequent addition of stoichiometric AlCl3
follows one of two paths, dependent on the steric demands of the QO ligand and
the electrophilicity of the resulting borenium cation. The phenyl- and
5-hexylthienylborenium cations, QOBPh(+) and QOBTh(+), are formed, whereas
QOBCl(+) is not. Instead, AlCl3 preferentially binds with QOBCl2 at oxygen,
forming QOBCl2 ·AlCl3, rather than abstracting chloride. A modest increase in the
steric demands around oxygen, by installing a methyl group at the 7-position of
the quinolato ligand, switches the reactivity with AlCl3 back to chloride
abstraction, allowing formation of <U+2009>Me<U+2009>2QOBCl(+). All the prepared borenium
cations are highly chlorophilic and exhibit significant interaction with AlCl4(-)
resulting in an equilibrium concentration of Lewis acidic "AlCl3" species. The
presence of "AlCl3(") species limits the alkyne substrates compatible with these 
borenium systems, with reaction of [QOBPh][AlCl4 ] with 1-pentyne exclusively
yielding the cyclotrimerised product, 1,3,5-tripropylbenzene. In contrast,
QOBPh(+) and QOBTh(+) systems effect the syn-1,2-carboboration of 3-hexyne. DFT
calculations at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p)/PCM(DCM) level confirm that the higher
migratory aptitude of Ph versus Me leads to a lower barrier to 1,2-carboboration 
relative to 1,1-carboboration.

Bcl3 regulates pro-survival and pro-inflammatory gene expression in cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma.

The advanced stages of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) are characterized not
only by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in high
susceptibility to infections, but also by high constitutive activity of NF<U+03BA>B,
which promotes cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. The increased
expression of the proto-oncogene Bcl3 belonging to I<U+03BA>B family is associated with 
the pathogenesis of the different types of human cancer, yet, the function and
regulation of Bcl3 in CTCL have not been studied. Here, we show that Bcl3 is
highly expressed in CTCL Hut-78 and HH cells. The suppression of Bcl3 levels
decreases the expression of the pro-survival genes cIAP1 and cIAP2, reduces cell 
viability, and increases CTCL apoptosis. Interestingly, Bcl3 suppression
concomitantly increases expression and the release of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-8 and IL-17 in CTCL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies
show that Bcl3 regulates cIAP1, cIAP2, IL-8 and IL-17 gene expression through
direct binding to their promoters. Bcl3 expression is regulated by bortezomib
(BZ)-mediated proteasome inhibition, and BZ inhibits Bcl3 recruitment to its
target promoters, resulting in decreased expression of cIAP1 and cIAP2, but
increased expression of IL-8 and IL-17. The Bcl3 expression is regulated through 
NF<U+03BA>B subunit exchange on Bcl3 promoter. In untreated cells, the Bcl3 promoter is 
occupied predominantly by p65/p50 heterodimers, inducing Bcl3 expression;
however, in BZ-treated cells, the p65/50 heterodimers are replaced by p52
subunits, resulting in Bcl3 transcriptional repression. These data provide the
first insights into the function and regulation of Bcl3 in CTCL, and indicate
that Bcl3 has an important pro-survival and immunosuppressive role in these
cells.

Disease processes and trauma affecting nerve-evoked muscle activity, motor
neurons, synapses and myofibers cause different levels of muscle weakness, i.e., 
reduced maximal force production in response to voluntary activation or nerve
stimulation. However, the mechanisms of muscle weakness are not well known. Using
murine models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice),
congenital myasthenic syndrome (AChE knockout mice and Musk(V789M/-) mutant
mice), Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (Hspg2(C1532YNEO/C1532YNEO) mutant mice) and
traumatic nerve injury (Neurotomized wild-type mice), we show that the reduced
maximal activation capacity (the ability of the nerve to maximally activate the
muscle) explains 52%, 58% and 100% of severe weakness in respectively SOD1(G93A),
Neurotomized and Musk mice, whereas muscle atrophy only explains 37%, 27% and 0%.
We also demonstrate that the impaired maximal activation capacity observed in
SOD1, Neurotomized, and Musk mice is not highly related to Hdac4 gene
upregulation. Moreover, in SOD1 and Neurotomized mice our results suggest LC3,
Fn14, Bcl3 and Gadd45a as candidate genes involved in the maintenance of the
severe atrophic state. In conclusion, our study indicates that muscle weakness
can result from the triggering of different signaling pathways. This knowledge
may be helpful in designing therapeutic strategies and finding new drug targets
for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital myasthenic syndrome,
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and nerve injury.

miR-2909-mediated regulation of KLF4: a novel molecular mechanism for
differentiating between B-cell and T-cell pediatric acute lymphoblastic
leukemias.

BACKGROUND: microRNAs (miRNAs) play both oncogenic and oncostatic roles in
leukemia. However, the molecular details underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of 
their target genes in pediatric B- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias
(ALLs) remain unclear. The present study investigated the relationship between
miR-2909 and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and its functional relevance to cell
cycle progression and immortalization in patients with pediatric ALL.
METHODS: Elevated levels of miR-2909 targeted the tumor suppressor gene KLF4 in
pediatric B-cell, but not pediatric T-cell ALL, as detected by pMIR-GFP reporter 
assay. Expression levels of genes including apoptosis-antagonizing transcription 
factor (AATF), MYC, B-cell lymphoma (BCL3), P21CIP, CCND1 and SP1 in B- and
T-cells from patients with pediatric ALL were compared with control levels using 
real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western
blotting, and reporter assays.
RESULTS: We identified two novel mutations in KLF4 in pediatric T-ALL. A mutation
in the 3' untranslated region of the KLF4 gene resulted in loss of
miR-2909-mediated regulation, while mutation in its first or third zinc-finger
motif (Zf1/Zf3) rendered KLF4 transcriptionally inactive. This mutation was a
frameshift mutation resulting in alteration of the Zf3 motif sequence in the
mutant KLF4 protein in all pediatric T-ALL samples. Homology models, docking
studies and promoter activity of its target gene P21CIP confirmed the lack of
function of the mutant KLF4 protein in pediatric T-ALL. Moreover, the inability
of miR-2909 to regulate KLF4 and its downstream genes controlling cell cycle and 
apoptosis in T-cell but not in B-ALL was verified by antagomiR-2909 transfection.
Comprehensive sequence analysis of KLF4 identified the predominance of isoform 1 
(~55 kDa) in most patients with pediatric B-ALL, while those with pediatric T-ALL
expressed isoform 2 (~51 kDa).
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel miR-2909-KLF4 molecular axis able to
differentiate between the pathogeneses of pediatric B- and T-cell ALLs, and which
may represent a new diagnostic/prognostic marker.

Packing considerations of 10-oxa-9-boraphenanthrene derivatives.

The crystal structures of three products of the reaction of 2-phenylphenol and
BCl3 have been determined. The structures show intriguing packing patterns and an
interesting case of pseudosymmetry. In addition, one of the two polymorphs has a 
primitive monoclinic crystal system, but it is twinned and emulates an
orthorhombic C-centred structure. Tris(biphenyl-2-yl) borate, C36H27BO3, (III),
crystallizes with only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The dihedral angles
between the planes of the aromatic rings in the biphenyl moieties are 50.47 (13),
44.95 (13) and 42.60 (13)°. The boron centre is in a trigonal planar coordination
with two of the biphenyl residues on one side of the BO3 plane and the remaining 
biphenyl residue on the other side. One polymorph of
10-oxa-9-boraphenanthren-9-ol, C12H9BO2, (Va), crystallizes with two almost
identical molecules (r.m.s. deviation of all non-H atoms = 0.039 Å) in the
asymmetric unit. All non-H atoms lie in a common plane (r.m.s. deviation =
0.015 Å for both molecules in the asymmetric unit). The two molecules in the
asymmetric unit are connected into dimers via O-H···O hydrogen bonds. A second
polymorph of 10-oxa-9-boraphenanthren-9-ol, (Vb), crystallizes as a
pseudo-merohedral twin with two almost identical molecules (r.m.s. deviation of
all non-H atoms = 0.035 Å) in the asymmetric unit. All non-H atoms lie in a
common plane (r.m.s. deviation = 0.012 Å for molecule 1 and 0.014 Å for molecule 
A). Each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is connected into a
centrosymmetric dimer via O-H···O hydrogen bonds. The main difference between the
two polymorphic structures is that in (Va) the two molecules in the asymmetric
unit are hydrogen bonded to each other, whereas in (Vb), each molecule in the
asymmetric unit forms a hydrogen-bonded dimer with its centrosymmetric
equivalent. 9-[(Biphenyl-2-yl)oxy]-10-oxa-9-boraphenanthrene, C24H17BO2, (VI),
crystallizes with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The main differences
between them are the dihedral angles between the ring planes. Apart from the
biphenyl moiety, all non-H atoms lie in a common plane (r.m.s. deviations =
0.026, 0.0231, 0.019 and 0.033 Å for molecules 1, A, B and C, respectively). This
structure shows pseudosymmetry; molecules 1 and A, as well as molecules B and C, 
are related by a pseudo-translation of about 1/2 in the direction of the b axis. 
Molecules 1 and B, as well as molecules A and C, are related by a
pseudo-inversion centre at 1/4,1/8,1/2. Neither between molecules 1 and C nor
between molecules A and B can pseudosymmetry be found.

Quantum chemical and matrix-IR characterization of CH3CN-BCl3: a complex with two
distinct minima along the B-N bond potential.

We have characterized the structural and energetic properties of CH3CN-BCl3via
computations and matrix-IR spectroscopy. We find two equilibrium structures of
the complex via computations. At the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level, the global minimum
energy structure has a B-N distance of 1.601 Å, and a binding energy of 12.0 kcal
mol(-1). The secondary structure lies 7.1 kcal mol(-1) higher in energy with a
B-N distance of 2.687 Å and a binding energy of 4.9 kcal mol(-1). Computational
scans of the B-N potential curve using both DFT and post-HF methods indicate that
a significant barrier exists between these structures, and that it lies 1 to 2
kcal mol(-1) above the secondary minimum at a B-N distance of about 2.2 Å. We
also observed several key, structurally-sensitive IR bands for six isotopic forms
of the complex in neon matrices, including: the B-Cl asymmetric stretching band
(<U+03BD>) at 792 cm(-1) and the C-N stretching band (<U+03BD>CN) at 2380 cm(-1) (for the
primary isotopomer, CH3C(14)N-(11)BCl3). These frequencies are consistent with
computational predictions for the minimum-energy form of the complex. Energy
decomposition analyses were conducted for CH3CN-BCl3 and also two related
complexes, CH3CN-BF3 and CH3CN-BH3. These provide insight into the trend in Lewis
acidity of the BX3 acceptors toward nitriles. Furthermore, these analyses
indicate that the barrier along the B-N potential of CH3CN-BCl3 results from
Pauli repulsion between the p electrons on the nitrile moiety and the chlorine
atoms in BCl3, which is significant at relatively long distances where attractive
bonding interactions fail to overcome it.

The first theoretical results of core-valence correlation effects are presented
for the infrared wavenumbers and intensities of the BF3 and BCl3 molecules, using
(double- and triple-zeta) Dunning core-valence basis sets at the CCSD(T) level.
The results are compared with those calculated in the frozen core approximation
with standard Dunning basis sets at the same correlation level and with the
experimental values. The general conclusion is that the effect of core-valence
correlation is, for infrared wavenumbers and intensities, smaller than the effect
of adding augmented diffuse functions to the basis set, e.g., cc-pVTZ to
aug-cc-pVTZ. Moreover, the trends observed in the data are mainly related to the 
augmented functions rather than the core-valence functions added to the basis
set. The results obtained here confirm previous studies pointing out the large
descrepancy between the theoretical and experimental intensities of the
stretching mode for BCl3.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that is best known
for its role in mediating the toxic responses elicited by poly aromatic
hydrocarbons as well as many other environmental factors; is also involved in
breast cancer progression. We previously reported that stable knockdown of AhR
decreased the tumorigenic properties of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cell line; whereas ectopic overexpression of AhR was sufficient to
transform immortalized human mammary epithelial cells to exhibit malignant
phenotypes. In the present study we investigated the genes that are
differentially regulated by AhR and are controlling cellular processes linked to 
breast cancer. We used Affymetrix Human GeneChip 1.0-ST whole transcriptome
arrays to analyze alterations of gene expression resulting from stable AhR
knockdown in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The expression of 144 genes 
was significantly altered with a =2.0-fold change and a multiple test corrected
p-value =0.05, as a result of AhR knockdown. We demonstrate that AhR knockdown
alters the expression of several genes known to be linked to cancer. These genes 
include those involved in tryptophan metabolism (KYNU), cell growth (MUC1 and
IL8), cell survival (BIRC3 and BCL3), cell migration and invasion (S100A4 and
ABI3), multi-drug resistance (ABCC3) and angiogenesis (VEGFA and CCL2). The
identification of the genes and pathways affected by AhR depletion provides new
insight into possible molecular events that could explain the reported phenotypic
changes. In conclusion AhR knockdown alters the expression of genes known to
enhance or inhibit cancer progression; tipping the balance towards a state that
counteracts tumor progression.

Fucose-specific DC-SIGN signalling directs T helper cell type-2 responses via
IKKe- and CYLD-dependent Bcl3 activation.

Carbohydrate-specific signalling through DC-SIGN provides dendritic cells with
plasticity to tailor immunity to the nature of invading microbes. Here we
demonstrate that recognition of fucose-expressing extracellular pathogens like
Schistosoma mansoni and Helicobacter pylori by DC-SIGN favors T helper cell
type-2 (TH2) responses via activation of atypical NF-<U+03BA>B family member Bcl3.
Crosstalk between TLR and DC-SIGN signalling results in TLR-induced MK2-mediated 
phosphorylation of LSP1, associated with DC-SIGN, upon fucose binding.
Subsequently, IKKe and CYLD are recruited to phosphorylated LSP1. IKKe activation
is pivotal for suppression of CYLD deubiquitinase activity and subsequent nuclear
translocation of ubiquitinated Bcl3. Bcl3 activation represses TLR-induced
proinflammatory cytokine expression, while enhancing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and
TH2-attracting chemokine expression, shifting TH differentiation from TH1 to TH2 
polarization. Thus, DC-SIGN directs adaptive TH2 immunity to fucose-expressing
pathogens via an IKKe-CYLD-dependent signalling pathway leading to Bcl3
activation, which might be targeted in vaccination strategies or to prevent
aberrant inflammation and allergy.

The recovery of liver mass is mainly mediated by proliferation of hepatocytes
after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats. Studying the gene expression profiles
of hepatocytes after 2/3 PH will be helpful to investigate the molecular
mechanisms of liver regeneration (LR). We report here the first application of
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze the biological
implications of gene expression changes associated with LR. WGCNA identifies 12
specific gene modules and some hub genes from hepatocytes genome-scale microarray
data in rat LR. The results suggest that upregulated MCM5 may promote hepatocytes
proliferation during LR; BCL3 may play an important role by activating or
inhibiting NF-kB pathway; MAPK9 may play a permissible role in DNA replication by
p38 MAPK inactivation in hepatocytes proliferation stage. Thus, WGCNA can provide
novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms of LR.

Materials with both fluorescence and room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) can
be useful in the field of optoelectronics. Here we present a general strategy,
taking advantage of carbonyl compounds, which have been known to possess
efficient intersystem crossing with high triplet state yield, as well as a
strongly fluorescent intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state, to produce
materials with both fluorescence and RTP at the same time, or dual-emission. In
the presented model systems, in order to generate a suitable ICT state, Lewis
acid binding to aromatic ketone derivatives has been proved to be a viable
method. We have selected AlCl3, BCl3, BF3, and GdCl3 as binding Lewis acids, in
that they exhibit sufficiently strong binding affinity toward the aromatic ketone
derivatives to afford stable complexes and yet do not possess low-lying
electronic transitions vs the ligands. We have successfully observed
dual-emission from these designed complexes in polymers, which act to suppress
competitive thermal decay at room temperature. One of the complexes is
particularly interesting as it is dual-emissive in the crystalline state.
Single-crystal XRD reveals that the molecule forms multiple hydrogen bonds with
its neighbors in crystals, which may significantly enhance the rigidity of the
environment.

Inhibition of transcription by B cell Leukemia 3 (Bcl-3) protein requires
interaction with nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) p50.

Collins PE(1), Kiely PA, Carmody RJ.

Author information: 
(1)From the Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl-3) is an essential negative regulator of NF-<U+03BA>B during
Toll-like receptor and TNF receptor signaling. Bcl-3 also interacts with a number
of transcriptional regulators, including homodimers of the NF-<U+03BA>B p50 subunit.
Deletion of Bcl-3 results in increased NF-<U+03BA>B p50 ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation and increased inflammatory gene expression. We employed immobilized
peptide array technology to define a region of p50 required for the formation of 
a Bcl-3·p50 homodimer immunosuppressor complex. Our data demonstrate that amino
acids 359-361 and 363 of p50 are critical for interaction with Bcl-3 and
essential for Bcl-3-mediated inhibition of inflammatory gene expression. Bcl-3 is
unable to interact with p50 when these amino acids are mutated, rendering it
incapable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of NF-<U+03BA>B. Bcl-3
interaction-defective p50 is hyperubiquitinated and has a significantly reduced
half-life relative to wild-type p50. Nfkb1(-/-) cells reconstituted with mutated 
p50 precursor p105 are hyperresponsive to TNFa stimulation relative to wild-type 
p105, as measured by inflammatory gene expression. Mutant p105 recapitulates a
Bcl3(-/-) phenotype. This study demonstrates that interaction with p50 is
necessary and sufficient for the anti-inflammatory properties of Bcl-3 and
further highlights the importance of p50 homodimer stability in the control of
NF-<U+03BA>B target gene expression.

Basal PIR expression in HeLa cells is driven by NRF2 via evolutionary conserved
antioxidant response element.

Pirin, a product of the PIR gene, is an iron-binding protein acting as a
transcriptional coregulator implicated in the regulation of the NF-<U+03BA>B-related
transcription via interaction with RelA (p65), as well as BCL3 and NF-<U+03BA>B1 (p50)
proteins. Alterations in pirin expression were observed in various tumors and
under oxidative stress conditions. The aim of the present work was to analyze the
regulation of the transcription of the human PIR gene. Using constructs
containing a different sized PIR promoter and the luciferase reporter genes we
found that in HeLa cells PIR transcription is mostly dependent on a highly
conserved antioxidant response element located 281 bp downstream of the
transcription start site. We have proved that the NRF2 transcription factor binds
to this element in vivo and drives the basal PIR expression. We hypothesize that 
regulation of the PIR expression may constitute a mechanism by which NRF2 is able
to modulate the activity of NF-<U+03BA>B and possibly other signaling pathways.

Non syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCLP) is a complex congenital anomaly
with varying incidence among patients of different geographical origins. Multiple
contributing factors are known to trigger the cleft formation. There are several 
genes involved in the aetiology of NSCLP and they are different in different
populations. The genetic components of clefts that underlie the susceptibility to
respond to the environment still remain unclear. In this study, five
microsatellite polymorphisms from five candidate genes were employed to analyze
the association between these genes and NSCLP in 83 patients and 90 controls.
Genotyping was performed by separating and visualizing the fluorescently-labeled 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. The association of the five
microsatellite polymorphisms with NSCLP was tested by using the CLUMP v1.9
program that uses the Monte Carlo method. The genotypic distribution is in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group for only the MSX1 and DLX3 genes.
The RARA microsatellite was significantly associated with NSCLP. Our results
suggest that the RARA gene is involved in pathogenesis of cleft lip and palate in
South Indians.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibition induces lymphoma cell
death through reactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway and

Epigenetic regulation mediated by lysine- and arginine-specific enzymes plays an 
essential role in tumorigenesis, and enhanced expression of the type II protein
arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as well as the polycomb repressor complex PRC2
has been associated with increased cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show
that PRMT5 is overexpressed in three different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell
lines and clinical samples as well as in mouse primary lymphoma cells and that it
up-regulates PRC2 expression through inactivation of the retinoblastoma proteins 
RB1 and RBL2. Although PRMT5 epigenetically controls RBL2 expression, it
indirectly promotes RB1 phosphorylation through enhanced cyclin D1 expression.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 knockdown in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell
lines and mouse primary lymphoma cells leads to RBL2 derepression and RB1
reactivation, which in turn inhibit PRC2 expression and trigger derepression of
its CASP10, DAP1, HOXA5, and HRK pro-apoptotic target genes. We also show that
reduced PRMT5 expression leads to cyclin D1 transcriptional repression via loss
of TP53K372 methylation, which results in decreased BCL3 expression and enhanced 
recruitment of NF-<U+03BA>B p52-HDAC1 repressor complexes to the cyclin D1 promoter.
These findings indicate that PRMT5 is a master epigenetic regulator that governs 
expression of its own target genes and those regulated by PRC2 and that its
inhibition could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for lymphoma patients.

BCL-3 attenuation of TNFA expression involves an incoherent feed-forward loop
regulated by chromatin structure.

Walker T(1), Adamson A, Jackson DA.

Author information: 
(1)Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United
Kingdom.

Induction of genes is rarely an isolated event; more typically occurring as part 
of a web of parallel interactions, or motifs, which act to refine and control
gene expression. Here, we define an Incoherent Feed-forward Loop motif in which
TNFa-induced NF-<U+03BA>B signalling activates expression of the TNFA gene itself and
also controls synthesis of the negative regulator BCL-3. While sharing a common
inductive signal, the two genes have distinct temporal expression profiles.
Notably, while the TNFA gene promoter is primed to respond immediately to
activated NF-<U+03BA>B in the nucleus, induction of BCL3 expression only occurs after a 
time delay of about 1h. We show that this time delay is defined by remodelling of
the BCL3 gene promoter, which is required to activate gene expression, and
characterise the chromatin delayed induction of BCL3 expression using
mathematical models. The models show how a delay in inhibitor production
effectively uncouples the rate of response to inflammatory cues from the final
magnitude of inhibition. Hence, within this regulatory motif, a delayed
(incoherent) feed-forward loop together with differential rates of TNFA (fast)
and BCL3 (slow) mRNA turnover provide robust, pulsatile expression of TNFa . We
propose that the structure of the BCL-3-dependent regulatory motif has a
beneficial role in modulating expression dynamics and the inflammatory response
while minimising the risk of pathological hyper-inflammation.

Total syntheses of yatakemycin, PDE-II, dictyodendrins, and heptaphylline are
described. This article focuses on the formation of aryl carbon-nitrogen bonds by
two methods: first by an aromatic amination reaction using a combination of CuI
and CsOAc, and then by a benzyne-mediated one-pot cyclization-functionalization
sequence. The aryl amination reaction shows a high functional group compatibility
and applicability for highly hindered substrates. The utility of this reaction
has been fully demonstrated through a total synthesis of yatakemycin, which
features the regioselective ring opening of (S)-epichlorohydrin with
2,6-dibromophenyllithium species and the efficient deprotection of benzyl groups 
of aryl benzyl ether with BCl3 in the presence of pentamethylbenzene. The
copper-mediated aryl amination reaction was applied to a one-pot double aryl
amination for facile access to the highly substituted pyrroloindole skeleton,
which led to a concise total synthesis of PDE-II. A highly efficient total
synthesis of dictyodendrins A-E was accomplished by the development of a novel
benzyne-mediated one-pot indoline formation/cross-coupling sequence for the
construction of a highly substituted key indoline intermediate. Peripheral
substituents were introduced onto this intermediate in a modular fashion to
complete the total synthesis of dictyodendrins A-E. The utility of the one-pot
benzyne-mediated cyclization-functionalization reaction was demonstrated by the
total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid, heptaphylline.

Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T
cell leukemia (ATL) and various inflammatory disorders including
HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax
is known to cause permanent activation of many cellular transcription factors
including nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B), cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate
response element-binding protein, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Here, we show
that NF-<U+03BA>B-binding cofactor inhibitor of NF-<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> (I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6>) is constitutively
expressed in HTLV-I-infected T cell lines and ATL cells, and Tax transactivates
the I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> gene, mainly through NF-<U+03BA>B. Microarray analysis of I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6>-expressing
uninfected T cells demonstrated that I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> induced the expression of NF-<U+03BA>B. and
interferon-regulatory genes such as B cell CLL/lymphoma 3 (Bcl3),
guanylate-binding protein 1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription
1. The transcriptional activation domain, nuclear localization signal, and
NF-<U+03BA>B-binding domain of I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> were required for Bcl3 induction, and I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6>
synergistically enhanced Tax-induced Bcl3 transactivation in an NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent
manner. Interestingly, I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> inhibited Tax-induced NF-<U+03BA>B, AP-1 activation, and
HTLV-I transcription. Furthermore, I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> interacted with Tax in vitro and this
interaction was also observed in an HTLV-I-transformed T cell line. These results
suggest that I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> modulates Tax-dependent and Tax-independent gene transcription
in T cells. The function of I<U+03BA>B-<U+03B6> may be of significance in ATL genesis and
pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated diseases.

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) are common birth
defects with a complex etiology. Multiple interacting loci and possible
environmental factors influence the risk of NSCL/P. 12 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 7 candidate genes were tested using an allele-specific
primer extension for case-control and case-parent analyses in northeast China in 
236 unrelated patients, 185 mothers and 154 fathers, including 128 complete

association with NSCL/P. In IRF6, statistical evidence of an association between 
rs2235371 (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.003), rs2013162 (p<0.0001) and NSCL/P was observed in
case-control analyses. Family based association tests (FBATs) showed

MYC/BCL2 double-hit high-grade B-cell lymphoma.

Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) has been defined by others as a B-cell lymphoma with
MYC/8q24 rearrangement in combination with a translocation involving another
gene, such as BCL2, BCL3, or BCL6. The most common form of DHL has translocations
involving MYC and BCL2, also known as MYC/BCL2 DHL. In recent years, a number of 
case series of MYC/BCL2 DHL have been published. Most cases of MYC/BCL2 DHL
morphologically resemble diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell
lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt
lymphoma. These tumors are of B-cell lineage, have a germinal center B-cell
immunophenotype with a high proliferation rate, and a complex karyotype. Patients
with these tumors have an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis despite
high-intensity chemotherapy. More recently, studies have suggested expanding the 
spectrum of MYC/BCL2 DHL to include cases that have concurrent MYC and BCL2
cytogenetic abnormalities, but not necessarily translocations. In addition,
overexpression of MYC and BCL2 has been shown in an appreciable subset of DLBCL
tumors. These tumors show overlap with MYC/BCL2 DHL, but are not equivalent. In
this review, we discuss the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and
prognostic features of MYC/BCL2 DHL.

Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules Charge-Charge Flux-Dipole Flux (QTAIM/CCFDF)
models have been determined for the BF3 and BCl3 molecules. Model parameters were
obtained from MP2/6-31G(2d,2p) wave functions owing to their accurate estimations
of the BF3 intensities and were found to be insensitive to changes in basis sets 
with polarization functions and to the level of electron correlation treatment,
MP2, QCISD and DFT. The BF3 stretching intensity has a very dominant equilibrium 
charge contribution with small charge and dipole fluxes occurring in the opposite
direction to the charge movement. Large equilibrium charge and small dynamic
contributions are also characteristic of stretching vibrations in the ionic
diatomic molecules, NaF, NaCl, LiF and LiCl. Furthermore the Laplacians of the
electron density at the bond critical points of BF3 and these diatomics are all
positive indicating electron depletion in their bonding regions relative to large
electronic densities concentrated around their nuclei that is characteristic of
ionic bonds. The MP2/6-31G(2d,2p) BCl3 stretching intensity can be accurately
estimated by equilibrium charge movement since the charge and dipole fluxes
almost exactly cancel one another. Both in-plane and out-of-plane BF3 and BCl3
bending deformations are described by equilibrium charge movements that are
partially canceled by opposing dipole fluxes that measure the effect on the
dipole moment change from electron densities polarized in the opposite direction.
Charge fluxes are calculated to be small for the in-plane deformations and are
zero by symmetry for the out-of-plane ones.

Optimized procedures for the previously reported conversions of 1,3-diiodobenzene
and perfluorohexyliodide (Rf6I; copper, DMSO, 140 °C) to 1,3-C6H4(Rf6)2 (3;
86-70%) and 3 to Br(3,5-C6H3(Rf6)2 (2; NBS, H2SO4/CF3CO2H; 88-75%) are described.
The latter is converted (t-BuLi, BCl3) to the "fluorous BArf" salt
NaB(3,5-C6H3(Rf6)2)4 (1 or NaBArf6; 77-70%), as given earlier. When orange
aqueous solutions of [Co(en)3]Cl3 (en = ethylenediamine) are treated with
perfluoro(methylcyclohexane) (PFMC) solutions of 1 (1:3 mol ratio), the aqueous
phase decolorizes and [Co(en)3](BArf6)3 can be isolated from the fluorous phase
(96%). Similar reactions with the trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine analogue
[Co(R,R-chxn)3]Cl3 and [Ru(bipy)3]Cl2 give [Co-(R,R-chxn)3](BArf6)3 (92%) and
[Ru(bipy)3](BArf6)2 (95%). All of these salts are isolated as hydrates and
exhibit toluene/PFMC partition coefficients of =1:=99, establishing that the
anion BArf6(-) can efficiently transport polar polycations into highly nonpolar
fluorous phases. When equal volumes of CH2Cl2 and PFMC are charged with the
"nonfluorous" BArf (B(3,5-C6H3-(CF3)2)4) salt [Co(en)3](BArf)3 and 3.0 equiv of
the fluorous salt NaBArf6, the cobalt trication partitions predominantly into the
fluorous phase (64:36). The arene 2 crystallizes in a polar space group
(tetragonal, I4, Z = 8) with fluorous and nonfluorous domains and all eight
bromine atoms located essentially on one face of the unit cell.

As a distinct type of head and neck cancer, non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) is closely associated with EBV infection and massive lymphoid
infiltration. The unique histological features suggest that local inflammation
plays an important role in NPC tumourigenesis. We comprehensively characterized
NF-<U+03BA>B signalling, a key inflammatory pathway which might contribute to the
tumourigenesis of this EBV-associated cancer. By EMSA, western blotting, and
immunohistochemical staining, constitutive activation of distinct NF-<U+03BA>B
complexes, either p50/p50/Bcl3 or p50/RelB, was found in almost all EBV-positive 
NPC tumours. siRNA or chemical inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>B signalling significantly
inhibited the growth of EBV-positive NPC cells C666-1. Gene expression profiling 
identified a number of NF-<U+03BA>B target genes involved in cell proliferation,
apoptosis, immune response, and transcription. We further confirmed that p50
signals modulate the expression of multiple oncogenes (MYB, BCL2), chemokines,
and chemokine receptors (CXCL9, CXCL10, CX3CL1, and CCL20). The findings support 
a crucial role of these constitutively activated NF-<U+03BA>B signals in NPC
tumourigenesis and local inflammation. In addition to expression of the viral
oncoprotein LMP1, genetic alteration of several NF-<U+03BA>B regulators (eg TRAF3,
TRAF2, NFKBIA, A20) also contributes to the aberrant NF-<U+03BA>B activation in
EBV-associated NPC. Except for LMP1-expressing C15 cells, all NPC tumour lines
harbour at least one of these genetic alterations. Importantly, missense
mutations of TRAF3, TRAF2, and A20 were also detected in 3/33 (9.1%) primary
tumours. Taken together with the reported LTBR amplification in 7.3% of primary
NPCs, genetic alterations in NF-<U+03BA>B pathways occurred in at least 16% of cases of 
this cancer. The findings indicate that distinct NF-<U+03BA>B signals are constitutively
activated in EBV-positive NPC cells by either multiple genetic changes or EBV
latent genes.

Hubland, 97074 Würzburg, Germany.

We herein report detailed investigations into the interaction of Lewis acidic
fluoroboranes, for example BF2Pf (Pf=perfluorophenyl) and BF2Ar(F)
(Ar(F)=3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), with Lewis basic platinum complexes such 
as [Pt(PEt3)3] and [Pt(PCy3)2] (Cy=cyclohexyl). Two presumed Lewis adducts could 
be identified in solution and corresponding secondary products of these Lewis
adducts were characterized in the solid state. Furthermore, the concept of
frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) was applied to the activation of ethene in the
system [Pt(BPf3)(CH2CH2)(dcpp)] (dcpp=1,3-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)propane;
Pf=perfluorophenyl). Finally, DFT calculations were performed to determine the
interaction between the platinum-centered Lewis bases and the boron-centered
Lewis acids. Additionally, several possible mechanisms for the oxidative addition
of the boranes BF3, BCl3, and BF2Ar(F) to the model complex [Pt(PMe3)2] are
presented.

A rare recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(14;19)(q32;q13), has been
identified in a variety of B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). We report a unique case of CLL in a patient carrying both trisomy
12 and t(14;19) (q32;q13.1), in whom t(11;14)(q13;q32) developed at relapse. The 
patient was a 77-yr-old woman, and her lymphoma cells at presentation showed
CD5(+), CD10(-), CD19(+), CD20(+)(dim), CD23(+), CD38(+), and CD11c(+). At
relapse, the patient's lymphoma cells showed positive staining for cyclin D1 in
addition to CD5, CD20, and CD23. Lymphoma cells in specimens at both presentation
and relapse were positive for lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) and negative for 
sex-determining region Y-box 11 (SOX11). IGH-BCL1 FISH became positive at
relapse. Split FISH assay using BCL1, BCL3, IGH, and CCND1 probes on lymph node
specimens obtained at presentation and at autopsy confirmed that the
translocation of BCL3 was solely detected in the lymph node at presentation and
detected BCL3 and CCND1 translocations in the specimen at autopsy. These
observations indicated that IGH-BCL3 and IGH-CCND1 had occurred in the same clone
after treatment of the disease. In line with immunohistochemical and cytogenetic 
studies, additional PCR analysis of the FR3-JH region showed the same sequence
derived from IGHV4-34 in specimens obtained at disease onset and relapse.

Understanding which are the genetic variants underlying the nutritional and
sensory properties of beef, enables improvement in meat quality. The aim of this 
study is to identify new molecular markers for meat quality through an
association study using candidate genes included in the PPARG and PPARGC1A
networks given their master role in coordinating metabolic adaptation in fat
tissue, muscle and liver. Amongst the novel associations found in this study,
selection of the positive marker variants of genes such as BCL3, LPL, PPARG,
SCAP, and SCD will improve meat organoleptic characteristics and health by
balancing the n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio in meat. Also previous results on GDF8 
and DGAT1 were validated, and the novel ATF4, HNF4A and PPARGC1A associations,
although slightly under the significance threshold, are consistent with their
physiological roles. These data contribute insights into the complex
gene-networks underlying economically important traits.

Regulation of cellular Cyclin D1 gene by arsenic is mediated through miR-2909.

Sharma M(1), Sharma S, Arora M, Kaul D.

Author information: 
(1)Experimental Medicine & Biotechnology Department, Postgraduate Institute of
Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh-160012, India.

Arsenic through its ability to regulate genes that link cell cycle control with
apoptosis has been widely recognized to play a crucial role in oncogenomics.
However, the molecular event by which arsenic affects such genes is far from
clear. Here we provide reasonably good evidence to support the view that arsenic 
exposure to human PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) at low
concentrations results in the over-expression of miR-2909 within these cells.
This over-expressed miR-2909 was found to regulate CCND1 (Cyclin D1) gene
expression, within these cells by inducing splice-switching of tumor suppresser
CYLD (Cylindromatosis) gene as well as modulation of SP1 (Specificity Protein 1) 
activity through the repression of KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor4) expression at the 
translational level. Arsenic dependent regulation of AATF (Apoptosis Antagonizing
Transcription factor) and BCL3 (B-cell Lymphoma 3) were also found to be
modulated through its capacity to induce miR-2909 expression. Based upon these
observations, a novel epigenomic pathway was proposed which may not only be
useful in understanding the paradoxical role of arsenic in oncogenomics but also 
may even be useful in devising various strategies for the treatment/prevention of
tumors induced by arsenic.

Cross-species analysis reveals evolving and conserved features of the nuclear
factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) proteins.

NF-<U+03BA>B is a key regulator of immune gene expression in metazoans. It is currently 
unclear what changes occurred in NF-<U+03BA>B during animal evolution and what features 
remained conserved. To address this question, we compared the biochemical and
functional properties of NF-<U+03BA>B proteins derived from human and the starlet sea
anemone (Nematostella vectensis) in 1) a high-throughput assay of in vitro
preferences for DNA sequences, 2) ChIP analysis of in vivo recruitment to the
promoters of target genes, 3) a LUMIER-assisted examination of interactions with 
cofactors, and 4) a transactivation assay. We observed a remarkable evolutionary 
conservation of the DNA binding preferences of the animal NF-<U+03BA>B orthologs. We
also show that NF-<U+03BA>B dimerization properties, nuclear localization signals, and
binding to cytosolic I<U+03BA>Bs are conserved. Surprisingly, the Bcl3-type nuclear I<U+03BA>B 
proteins functionally pair up only with NF-<U+03BA>B derived from their own species. The
basis of the differential NF-<U+03BA>B recognition by I<U+03BA>B subfamilies is discussed.

Concurrent rearrangements of BCL2, BCL3, and BCL11A genes in atypical chronic
lymphocytic leukemia.

Podgornik H, Pretnar J, Skopec B, Andoljek D, Cernelc P.

The most frequent chromosomal aberrations with the well established prognostic
meaning in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are +12, del(11q), del(13q), and
del(17p). Less common translocations lead to deregulation of genes primarily due 
to juxtaposition with IGH gene. We present a case of CLL patient with atypical
morphology and an aggressive course of disease. In spite of aggressive treatment 
including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation disease progressed
into a rare cutaneous Richter's syndrome. Trisomy 12 was found as a sole
chromosomal change at initial cytogenetic analysis of lymphoma cells. At
progression, besides trisomy 12 three concomitant balanced translocations
t(2;14)(p13;q32), t(14;19)(q32;q13), and t(18;22)(q21;q11) were found. The same
karyotype was confirmed in cells aspirated from skin infiltrates at Richter
transformation. Atypical cytological features, trisomy 12, and a progressive
course of disease observed in our case are typical for CLL with each of
particular Ig translocations that were concomitantly found in CLL for the first
time. Similar to "double hit" lymphoma concurrent rearrangements may be relevant 
also in CLL.

The ChIP-seq-defined networks of Bcl-3 gene binding support its required role in 
skeletal muscle atrophy.

Jackman RW(1), Wu CL, Kandarian SC.

Author information:

rjackman@bu.edu

NF-kappaB transcriptional activation is required for skeletal muscle disuse
atrophy. We are continuing to study how the activation of NF-kB regulates the
genes that encode the protein products that cause atrophy. Using ChIP-sequencing 
we found that Bcl-3, an NF-kB transcriptional activator required for atrophy,
binds to the promoters of a number of genes whose collective function describes
two major aspects of muscle wasting. By means of bioinformatics analysis of
ChIP-sequencing data we found Bcl-3 to be directing transcription networks of
proteolysis and energy metabolism. The proteolytic arm of the Bcl-3 networks
includes many E3 ligases associated with proteasomal protein degradation,
including that of the N-end rule pathway. The metabolic arm appears to be
involved in organizing the change from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in
atrophying muscle. For one gene, MuRF1, ChIP-sequencing data identified the
location of Bcl-3 and p50 binding in the promoter region which directed the
creation of deletant and base-substitution mutations of MuRF1 promoter constructs
to determine the effect on gene transcription. The results provide the first
direct confirmation that the NF-kB binding site is involved in the muscle
unloading regulation of MuRF1. Finally, we have combined the ChIP-sequencing
results with gene expression microarray data from unloaded muscle to map several 
direct targets of Bcl-3 that are transcription factors whose own targets describe
a set of indirect targets for NF-kB in atrophy. ChIP-sequencing provides the
first molecular explanation for the finding that Bcl3 knockout mice are resistant
to disuse muscle atrophy. Mapping the transcriptional regulation of muscle
atrophy requires an unbiased analysis of the whole genome, which we show is now
possible with ChIP-sequencing.

The aim of this study is to understand intracellular regulatory mechanisms in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which are either common to many
autoimmune diseases or specific to some of them. We incorporated large-scale data
such as protein-protein interactions, gene expression and demographical
information of hundreds of patients and healthy subjects, related to six
autoimmune diseases with available large-scale gene expression measurements:
multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis (JRA), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and type 1
diabetes (T1D). These data were analyzed concurrently by statistical and systems 
biology approaches tailored for this purpose. We found that chemokines such as
CXCL1-3, 5, 6 and the interleukin (IL) IL8 tend to be differentially expressed in
PBMCs of patients with the analyzed autoimmune diseases. In addition, the
anti-apoptotic gene BCL3, interferon-<U+03B3> (IFNG), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR)
gene physically interact with significantly many genes that tend to be
differentially expressed in PBMCs of patients with the analyzed autoimmune
diseases. In general, similar cellular processes tend to be differentially
expressed in PBMC in the analyzed autoimmune diseases. Specifically, the cellular
processes related to cell proliferation (for example, epidermal growth factor,
platelet-derived growth factor, nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B, Wnt/ß-catenin signaling,
stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase), inflammatory response
(for example, interleukins IL2 and IL6, the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor and the B-cell receptor), general signaling cascades
(for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase, p38 and TRK) and apoptosis are activated in most of the analyzed
autoimmune diseases. However, our results suggest that in each of the analyzed
diseases, apoptosis and chemotaxis are activated via different subsignaling
pathways. Analyses of the expression levels of dozens of genes and the
protein-protein interactions among them demonstrated that CD and UC have
relatively similar gene expression signatures, whereas the gene expression
signatures of T1D and JRA relatively differ from the signatures of the other
autoimmune diseases. These diseases are the only ones activated via the Fc<U+025B>
pathway. The relevant genes and pathways reported in this study are discussed at 
length, and may be helpful in the diagnoses and understanding of autoimmunity
and/or specific autoimmune diseases.

Bcl3 selectively promotes metastasis of ERBB2-driven mammary tumors.

Bcl3 is a putative proto-oncogene deregulated in hematopoietic and solid tumors. 
Studies in cell lines suggest that its oncogenic effects are mediated through the
induction of proliferation and inhibition of cell death, yet its role in
endogenous solid tumors has not been established. Here, we address the oncogenic 
effect of Bcl3 in vivo and describe how this Stat3-responsive oncogene promotes
metastasis of ErbB2-positive mammary tumors without affecting primary tumor
growth or normal mammary function. Deletion of the Bcl3 gene in ErbB2-positive
(MMTV-Neu) mice resulted in a 75% reduction in metastatic tumor burden in the
lungs with a 3.6-fold decrease in cell turnover index in these secondary lesions 
with no significant effect on primary mammary tumor growth, cyclin D1 levels, or 
caspase-3 activity. Direct inhibition of Bcl3 by siRNA in a transplantation model
of an Erbb2-positive mammary tumor cell line confirmed the effect of Bcl3 in
malignancy, suggesting that the effect of Bcl3 was intrinsic to the tumor cells. 
Bcl3 knockdown resulted in a 61% decrease in tumor cell motility and a
concomitant increase in the cell migration inhibitors Nme1, Nme2, and Nme3, the
GDP dissociation inhibitor Arhgdib, and the metalloprotease inhibitors Timp1 and 
Timp2. Independent knockdown of Nme1, Nme2, and Arhgdib partially rescued the
Bcl3 motility phenotype. These results indicate for the first time a
cell-autonomous disease-modifying role for Bcl3 in vivo, affecting metastatic
disease progression rather than primary tumor growth.

BACKGROUND: Cleft lip (CL) with or without palate (CLP) and isolated cleft palate
(CP) are etiologically complex diseases with interactions among various
environmental and genetic factors. The aim of the current study was to identify
association with genetic markers and phenotypic craniofacial data in patients
with CL/CLP/CP parents.
METHODS: Posteroanterior and lateral digital radiographs of the cranium were
obtained from 74 parents of patients with CL/CLP/CP. One hundred seventy-three
patients with CL/CLP/CP and 190 controls were enrolled in the study for the
association test. Five genetic markers of the IRF6 gene and 14 markers of the
19q13 locus were genotyped. Linear regression analysis was performed for the
relationship of cephalometric measurements with genotype data adjusted for age,
gender, and cleft type. Chi-square and transmission disequilibrium tests were
performed to evaluate differences in alleles of the BCL3 gene. Positive findings 
were replicated in an independent sample (n = 95) of patients with CL/CLP/CP
parents.
RESULTS: Genetic markers of the BCL3 gene at 19q13, rs7257231, and rs1979377 in
the familial association test and rs10401176 in the case-control association
test, were associated with craniofacial phenotype. Carriers of BCL3 allele
rs7257231T had longer posterior cranial bases than noncarriers (p(adjusted) =
0.0028), and in the familial-based association test showed the statistically
strongest relationship (p(adjusted) = 0.05) to phenotype. Relation of rs7257231
to facial formation was confirmed in the replication group (p = 0.0024).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that BCL3, which has functions related to cell 
adhesion and whose downregulation can cause disruption of ectodermal development,
is likely to be important in facial formation. Birth Defects Research (Part A),

Equilibrium structures and energies of gas-phase molecular complexes
SiH(4)···BH(3), SiH(4)···B(2)H(6), and SiH(4)···BCl(3) were determined using
second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and the aug-cc-pVTZ basis
set, with and without explicit core electron correlation. Single-point energies
were calculated for the MP2-optimized structures using MP2 with the aug-cc-pVQZ
basis set and using coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)) with both the aug-cc-pVTZ
and the aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets to extrapolate to the complete basis set (CBS).
Partition functions were calculated using the harmonic oscillator/rigid
rotorapproximation at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The explicit core
electron correlation is demonstrated to have significant impact on the structures
and binding energies and binding enthalpies of these complexes. The binding
enthalpies were obtained at various temperatures ranging from 0 K to the
dissociation temperatures of the complexes. The potential energy surfaces of the 
three complexes were explored, and no transition states were found along the
pathways from separated species to the complexes.

The transcriptional specificity of NF-<U+03BA>B dimers is coded within the <U+03BA>B DNA
response elements.

Nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA
elements, known collectively as <U+03BA>B sites, that are contained within the
promoters/enhancers of target genes. We found that the identity of the central
base pair (bp) of <U+03BA>B sites profoundly affects the transcriptional activity of
NF-<U+03BA>B dimers. RelA dimers prefer an A/T bp at this position for optimal
transcriptional activation (A/T-centric) and discriminate against G/C-centric <U+03BA>B 
sites. The p52 homodimer, in contrast, activates transcription from G/C-centric
<U+03BA>B sites in complex with Bcl3 but represses transcription from the A/T-centric
sites. The p52:Bcl3 complex binds to these two classes of <U+03BA>B sites in distinct
modes, permitting the recruitment of coactivator, corepressor, or both
coactivator and corepressor complexes in promoters that contain G/C-, A/T-, or
both G/C- and A/T-centric sites. Therefore, through sensing of bp differences
within <U+03BA>B sites, NF-<U+03BA>B dimers modulate biological programs by activating,
repressing, and altering the expression of effector genes.

Epigenetic changes through DNA methylation contribute to uterine stromal cell
decidualization.

Embryo-uterine interaction during early pregnancy critically depends on the
coordinated expression of numerous genes at the site of implantation. The
epigenetic mechanism through DNA methylation (DNM) plays a major role in the
control of gene expression, although this regulatory event remains unknown in
uterine implantation sites. Our analysis revealed the presence of DNA
methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in mouse endometrial cells on the receptive d 4 of
pregnancy and early postattachment (d 5) phase, whereas Dnmt3a had lower abundant
expression. Both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a were coordinately expressed in decidual cells
on d 6-8. 5-Methycytosine showed a similar expression pattern to that of Dnmt1.
The preimplantation inhibition of DNM by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytodine was not
antagonistic for embryonic attachment, although endometrial stromal cell
proliferation at the site of implantation was down-regulated, indicating a
disturbance with the postattachment decidualization event. Indeed, the peri- or
postimplantation inhibition of DNM caused significant abrogation of
decidualization, with concomitant loss of embryos. We next identified decidual
genes undergoing alteration of DNM using methylation-sensitive restriction
fingerprinting. One such gene, Chromobox homolog 4, an epigenetic regulator in
the polycomb group protein family, exhibited hypomethylation in promoter DNA and 
increased expression with the onset of decidualization. Furthermore, inhibition
of DNM resulted in enhanced expression of hypermethylated genes (Bcl3 and
Slc16a3) in the decidual bed as compared with control, indicating aberration of
gene expression may be associated with DNM-inhibition-induced decidual
perturbation. Overall, these results suggest that uterine DNM plays a major role 
for successful decidualization and embryo development during early pregnancy.

Francisella tularensis alters human neutrophil gene expression: insights into the
molecular basis of delayed neutrophil apoptosis.

Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa 52241, USA.

We demonstrated recently that Francisella tularensis profoundly impairs human
neutrophil apoptosis, but how this is achieved is largely unknown. Herein we used
human oligonucleotide microarrays to test the hypothesis that changes in
neutrophil gene expression contribute to this phenotype, and now demonstrate that
F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) caused significant changes in neutrophil 
gene expression over a 24-hour time period relative to the uninfected controls.
Of approximately 47,000 genes analyzed, 3,435 were significantly up- or
downregulated by LVS, including 365 unique genes associated with apoptosis and
cell survival. Specific targets in this category included genes asso-ciated with 
the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (CFLAR, TNFAIP3, TNFRSF10D, SOD2, 
BCL2A1, BIRC4, PIM2, TNFSF10, TNFRSF10C, CASP2 and CASP8) and genes that act via 
the NF<U+0138>B pathway and other mechanisms to prolong cell viability (NFKB1, NFKB2 and
RELA, IL1B, CAST, CDK2,GADD45B, BCL3, BIRC3, CDK2, IL1A, PBEF1, IL6, CXCL1, CCL4 
and VEGF). The microarray data were confirmed by qPCR and pathway analysis.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
remained abundant in polymorphonuclear leukocytes over 48 h of LVS infection,
whereas BAX mRNA and protein were progressively downregulated. These data
strongly suggest that antiapoptotic and prosurvival mechanisms collaborate to
sustain the viability of F. tularensis--infected neutrophils.

CYLD inhibits melanoma growth and progression through suppression of the JNK/AP-1
and ß1-integrin signaling pathways.

The molecular mechanisms mediating cylindromatosis (CYLD) tumor suppressor
function appear to be manifold. Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to the
increased levels of phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (pJNK), CYLD was
decreased in a majority of the melanoma cell lines and tissues examined.
Exogenous expression of CYLD but not its catalytically deficient mutant markedly 
inhibited melanoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and subcutaneous
tumor growth in vivo. In addition, the melanoma cells expressing exogenous CYLD
were unable to form pulmonary tumor nodules following tail-vein injection. At the
molecular level, CYLD decreased ß1-integrin and inhibited pJNK induction by tumor
necrosis factor-a or cell attachment to collagen IV. Moreover, CYLD induced an
array of other molecular changes associated with modulation of the "malignant"
phenotype, including a decreased expression of cyclin D1, N-cadherin, and nuclear
Bcl3, and an increased expression of p53 and E-cadherin. Most interestingly,
coexpression of the constitutively active MKK7 or c-Jun mutants with CYLD
prevented the above molecular changes, and fully restored melanoma growth and
metastatic potential in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that the JNK/activator
protein 1 signaling pathway underlies the melanoma growth and metastasis that are
associated with CYLD loss of function. Thus, restoration of CYLD and inhibition
of JNK and ß1-integrin function represent potential therapeutic strategies for
treatment of malignant melanoma.

University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710072, People's Republic of China.

The decomposition reaction rate in the BCl(3)-C(3)H(6)-H(2) gas phase reaction
system in preparing boron carbides was investigated based on the most favorable
reaction pathways proposed by Jiang et al. [Theor. Chem. Accs. 2010, 127, 519]
and Yang et al. [J. Theor. Comput. Chem. 2012, 11, 53]. The rate constants of all
the elementary reactions were evaluated with the variational transition state
theory. The vibrational frequencies for the stationary points as well as the
selected points along the minimum energy paths (MEPs) were calculated with
density functional theory at the B3PW91/6-311G(d,p) level and the energies were
refined with the accurate model chemistry method G3(MP2). For the elementary
reaction associated with a transition state, the MEP was obtained with the
intrinsic reaction coordinates, while for the elementary reaction without
transition state, the relaxed potential energy surface scan was employed to
obtain the MEP. The rate constants were calculated for temperatures within
200-2000 K and fitted into three-parameter Arrhenius expressions. The reaction
rates were investigated by using the COMSOL software to solve numerically the
coupled differential rate equations. The results show that the reactions are,
consistent with the experiments, appropriate at 1100-1500 K with the reaction
time of 30 s for 1100 K, 1.5 s for 1200 K, 0.12 s for 1300 K, 0.011 s for 1400 K,
or 0.001 s for 1500 K, for propene being almost completely consumed. The
completely dissociated species, boron carbides C(3)B, C(2)B, and CB, have very
low concentrations, and C(3)B is the main product at higher temperatures, while
C(2)B is the main product at lower temperatures. For the reaction time 1 s, all
these concentrations approach into a nearly constant. The maximum value (in
mol/m(3)) is for the highest temperature 1500 K with the orders of -13, -17, and 
-23 for C(3)B, C(2)B, and CB, respectively. It was also found that the logarithm 
of the overall reaction rate and reciprocal temperature have an excellent linear 
relationship within 700-2000 K with a correlation coefficient of 0.99996. This
corresponds to an apparent activation energy 337.0 kJ/mol, which is comparable
with the energy barrier 362.6 kJ/mol of the rate control reaction at 0 K but is
higher than either of the experiments 208.7 kJ/mol or the Gibbs free energy
barrier 226.2 kJ/mol at 1200 K.

Neoplastic transformation of T lymphocytes through transgenic expression of a
virus host modification protein.

Author information:

Virus host evasion genes are ready-made tools for gene manipulation and therapy. 
In this work we have assessed the impact in vivo of the evasion gene A238L of the
African Swine Fever Virus, a gene which inhibits transcription mediated by both
NF-<U+03BA>B and NFAT. The A238L gene has been selectively expressed in mouse T
lymphocytes using tissue specific promoter, enhancer and locus control region
sequences for CD2. The resulting two independently derived transgenic mice
expressed the transgene and developed a metastasic, angiogenic and transplantable
CD4(+)CD8(+)CD69(-) lymphoma. The CD4(+)CD8(+)CD69(-) cells also grew vigorously 
in vitro. The absence of CD69 from the tumour cells suggests that they were
derived from T cells at a stage prior to positive selection. In contrast,
transgenic mice similarly expressing a mutant A238L, solely inhibiting
transcription mediated by NF-<U+03BA>B, were indistinguishable from wild type mice.
Expression of Rag1, Rag2, TCRß-V8.2, CD25, FoxP3, Bcl3, Bcl2 l14, Myc, IL-2,
NFAT1 and Itk, by purified CD4(+)CD8(+)CD69(-) thymocytes from A238L transgenic
mice was consistent with the phenotype. Similarly evaluated expression profiles
of CD4(+)CD8(+) CD69(-) thymocytes from the mutant A238L transgenic mice were
comparable to those of wild type mice. These features, together with the
demonstration of (mono-)oligoclonality, suggest a transgene-NFAT-dependent
transformation yielding a lymphoma with a phenotype reminiscent of some acute
lymphoblastic lymphomas.

Downregulation of cylindromatosis gene, CYLD, confers a growth advantage on
malignant melanoma cells while negatively regulating their migration activity.

The cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) encodes a deubiquitinase that was initially
identified as a tumor suppressor and has recently been investigated in connection
with a variety of normal physiological processes. In contrast to its
cell-proliferative activity, the effect of CYLD protein on cell migration has
been a matter of debate. We investigated the effect of CYLD-siRNA on the
migration activity of malignant melanoma cells. Expression of CYLD mRNA/protein
was lower in 6 of 8 malignant melanoma cell lines than in 3 sets of
primary-cultured normal human epidermal melanocytes. Knockdown of CYLD
significantly increased the proliferation activities of two melanoma cell lines
(p<0.05), along with BCL3 nuclear translocation followed by CCND1 overexpression.
In contrast to the proliferation-related activity, CYLD knockdown significantly
decreased the cell migration of all the melanoma cell lines (n=7, p<0.05), and we
demonstrated that the mechanism regulating melanoma cell migration was activation
of RAC1 through the action of CYLD. Our findings provide new insight into the
role of CYLD-induced RAC1 activation in melanoma cell migration.

Although most patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) show clonal
rearrangement of T-cell receptor genes, few PTCLs show recurrent chromosomal
abnormalities. We describe here a rare chromosomal rearrangement,
t(14;19)(q11.2;q13.3), in a Lennert's lymphoma, a variant of PTCL, not otherwise 
specified. Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization assays showed that the
breakpoint in 19q13.3 was located distal to the BCL3 and PVRL2 genes, both of
which may be candidate proto-oncogenes. These findings suggest that another gene 
is involved in the pathogenic characteristics observed in this patient with
Lennert's lymphoma.

The most recent ceramic-matrix composites (CMC) considered for long-life
applications as thermostructural parts in aerospace propulsion contain, among
others, boron-rich phases like boron carbide. This compound is prepared by
thermal Chemical Vapour Infiltration (CVI), starting from precursors like boron
halides and hydrocarbons. We present a study aiming at a precise knowledge of the
gas-phase composition in a hot-zone LPCVD reactor fed with BCl3, CH4 and H2,
which combines experimental and theoretical approaches. This work has brought
strong evidences of the presence of Methydichloroborane (MDB, BCl2CH3) in the
process. It is demonstrated that this intermediate, the presence of which had
never been formally proved before, appears for processing temperatures slightly
lower than the deposition temperature of boron carbide. The study features
quantum chemical computations, which provide several pieces of information like
thermochemical and kinetic data, as well as vibration and rotation frequencies,
reaction kinetics computations, and experimental gas-phase characterization of
several species by FTIR, for several processing parameter sets. The main results 
are presented, and the place of MDB in the reaction scheme is discussed.

An improved thyroid hormone reporter assay to determine the thyroid hormone-like

A number of environmental chemicals have been reported to exhibit thyroid
hormone-like activity. Since thyroid hormones play a crucial role in development,
it is important to identify chemicals in the environment that are capable of
endocrine disruption of thyroid hormone homeostasis. In order to detect thyroid
hormone-like activity, the growth of pituitary cell lines has been commonly used 
as a sensitive marker, albeit with limited specificity to thyroid hormones.
Reporter gene assays using the thyroid hormone responsive element (TRE) connected
to the luciferase reporter gene have also been developed. Thus far however, this 
type of assay appears to have limited sensitivity compared to cell growth assays.
In the present study, we developed a highly sensitive TRE reporter gene assay by 
using a pituitary cell line, MtT/E-2, and by culturing cells in a serum-free
medium. Our assay was developed in order to detect T3 activity at a concentration
of 10(-11)M. This assay identified thyroid hormone-like activity from the
antiarrhythmic drug, amiodarone, and from three anti-parasitic drugs, bithionol, 
closantel and rafoxanide, all commonly used in veterinary medicine. Thyroid
hormone-like activity of these compounds was further confirmed by the induction
of BCL3 gene expression in MtT/E-2, which is known to be regulated by thyroid
hormones. Our improved assay was proved to be a sensitive tool for assessing
thyroid hormone-like activity of environmental chemicals.

This paper presents an ab initio study of the B/C/Cl/H gas phase mechanism,
featuring 10 addition-elimination reactions involving BH(i)Cl(j) (i + j = 3)
species and a first description of the chemical interaction between the
carbon-containing and boron-containing subsystems through the three reactions
BCl(3) + CH(4) <U+21CC> BCl(2)CH(3) + HCl, BHCl(2) + CH(4) <U+21CC> BCl(2)CH(3) + H(2), and
BCl(2) + CH(4) <U+21CC> BHCl(2) + CH(3). A reaction mechanism is then proposed and used 
to perform some illustrative equilibrium and kinetic calculations in the context 
of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of boron carbide. Our results show that the
new addition-elimination reaction paths play a crucial role by lowering
considerably the activation barrier with respect to previous theoretical
evaluations; they also confirm that BCl(2)CH(3) is an important species in the
mechanism.

Serine protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonyl fluoride, impairs
IL-12-induced activation of pSTAT4ß, NF<U+03BA>B, and select pro-inflammatory mediators 
from estrogen-treated mice.

Estrogen, a natural immunomodulator, is believed to be involved in the regulation
of not only normal immune responses, but also pathological conditions such as
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We have previously reported that estrogen
exposure induces several pro-inflammatory molecules including nitric oxide,
cytokines and chemokines (IFN<U+03B3>, IL-12, MCP-1, etc.) and modifies transcription
factors (preferential expression of STAT4ß, increased NF<U+03BA>B p50/p50 DNA binding,
and enhanced T-bet and Bcl-3) from activated splenocytes. Given that estrogen
promotes diverse range of pro-inflammatory molecules, and modifies transcription 
factors, it is plausible that estrogen upregulates a common set of molecular
event(s) that favors inflammation. Serine proteases are thought to play an
important role in inflammation. Therefore in this study, we investigated the
consequence of exposure of splenocytes stimulated with a key Th1/IFN<U+03B3>-inducing
cytokine IL-12 or ConA from estrogen-treated mice to a serine protease inhibitor,
4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), on inflammatory cytokines
(IFN<U+03B3>, IL-12) and related transcription factors (STAT4a/ß, T-bet, NF<U+03BA>B). Exposure
of splenocytes to AEBSF for 3h noticeably inhibited the induction of IFN<U+03B3>, IL-12,
and IL-12-induced STAT4ß, mRNA expression of T-bet and IL-12Rß2. The
AEBSF-mediated inhibition of cytokines was accompanied by the expression of a
normal-sized NF<U+03BA>B, downregulation of p50/p50 DNA binding but did not alter Bcl3. 
These findings provide a new understanding of inflammation and inhibition of
serine proteases has important implications for designing novel therapeutic

Iron binding protein pirin was isolated as an interactor of the NFIX
transcription factor but it can also form complexes with Bcl3 and NF-<U+03BA>B1(p50).
Alterations of pirin expression were observed in various tumors and after
exposure to pro-carcinogenic oxidative stressors. The aim of the present work was
to study the level of pirin transcription in an in vivo model of oxidative
stress, namely, in Sod1-deficient mice. We have found that Sod1(-/-) mice have a 
significantly elevated level of Pir mRNA in the spleen and kidney but not in the 
liver, heart, or/and brain. We have also shown that similarly to its human
ortholog, the mouse Pir gene transcription level varies significantly between
organs. The highest expression was found in the liver and the lowest in the
spleen and kidney. Based on literature data, we propose the involvement of Nrf2, 
AP-1, and NF-<U+03BA>B transcription factors in Pir up-regulation in Sod1(-/-) mice.

estrogen in pituitary lactotrophs in primary culture.

In addition to their well-known stimulatory action, estrogens have an
anti-proliferative effect. The present study was undertaken to investigate the
mechanism by which 17ß-estradiol (E2) inhibits insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1)-induced proliferation in vitro in the rat pituitary lactotroph, a typical
estrogen-responsive cell. E2 treatment of pituitary cells did not change levels
of IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of proliferation-related protein kinases such as
Erk1/2 and Akt. We performed global gene expression profiling by DNA microarray
analysis and identified 177 genes regulated by E2 in the presence of IGF-1. These
results were verified by quantitative real time PCR. The estrogen-regulated genes
included several NF<U+03BA>B family related genes. As pharmacological inhibition of the 
NF<U+03BA>B pathway blocked IGF-1-induced lactotroph proliferation, we chose to
investigate whether one NF<U+03BA>B pathway gene, Bcl3, was involved in the
anti-proliferative action of E2. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Bcl3
expression attenuated IGF-1-induced lactotroph proliferation. Even minimal
induced overexpression of Bcl3 blocked the anti-proliferative action of E2. In
contrast, Nfkb2, another E2-downregulated protein, required maximal
overexpression to block the anti-proliferative action of E2. These results
suggest that inhibition of Bcl3 expression is involved in the anti-proliferative 
action of estrogens in pituitary lactotrophs in culture.

BCL3 rearrangement, amplification and expression in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma.

Ibrahim HA(1), Amen F, Reid AG, Naresh KN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Histopathology, Hammersmith Hospital and Imperial College,
London, UK.

AIMS: Aim of the study is to investigate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
for the presence of BCL3 gene rearrangement and protein expression and to
correlate these with immunophenotypic subsets of DLBCL. We aimed to investigate
the pathogenetic implication of BCL3 in DLBCL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue microarray sections from 78 DLBCLs were evaluated for
BCL3 protein expression using immunohistochemistry and for BCL3 and IGH
rearrangement using Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) with split-apart
probes. BCL3 expression was positive in 36/78 cases, of which BCL3 rearrangement 
was seen seen in one case. Three additional cases showed evidence of trisomy of
BCL3/chromosome 19, and two of these three cases showed BCL3 expression. The four
cases with FISH-detectable abnormalities showed MUM1 expression and had a
non-germinal center (GC) phenotype. The median [and inter-quartile range (IQR)]
percentage of BCL3-positive cells in MUM1-positive and MUM1-negative subsets was 
65% (5-85%) and 5% (0-20%), respectively (P < 0.001). The median (IQR) percentage
of BCL3-positive cells among GC and non-GC subsets of DLBCLs was 12% (12-81%) and
60% (6-87%), respectively (P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Rearrangement or amplification involving the BCL3 gene is a rare
event in DLBCL but is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of a minority of 
de novo DLBCL. BCL3 over-expression is more frequent and occurs in the absence of
rearrangement or amplification and is a feature of the non-GC subset of DLBCL.

100. Modulators of STAT Transcription Factors for the Targeted Therapy of Cancer
(STAT3 Inhibitors).

The transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3) mediates the effects of growth factors and cytokines by regulating gene
expression. In many human cancers, including breast and prostate, STAT3 is
constitutively active. This leads to increased expression of genes regulating
survival and proliferation, and drives the malignant behavior of these cells. As 
a result, the identification of novel compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3
activity may lead to useful tools to reduce cancer-associated cell proliferation,
inflammation, and chemotherapeutic resistance. In this report we describe the
identification of a potent and selective STAT3 inhibitor through the use of high 
throughput screening, synthetic medicinal chemistry, and molecular assays. The
novel inhibitor (PubChem CID-2100018) belongs to the thienopyrimidine scaffold
and is assigned probe number ML116 within the NIH Molecular Libraries Probe
Production Center Network. Probe ML116 exhibits a STAT3 IC50 value of
approximately 4 micromolar and does not inhibit the STAT1, STAT5, or NFkB
signaling pathways (IC50 values greater than 56 micromolar), as determined using 
cell-based luciferase reporter assays. Quantitative PCR experiments demonstrated 
that probe ML116 inhibits transcription of the STAT3-regulated gene BCL3. In
contrast, the gene A20 which is regulated by the unrelated transcription factor
NF-kB, was not inhibited, further supporting the STAT3 selectivity of this probe.
Whereas this compound can induce loss of viability of breast cancer cell lines
such as MDA-MB-468 cells that are dependent on STAT3 activity, it displays
essentially no toxicity to STAT3-independent SKBR3 breast cancer cells. Similar
results were found in ovarian cancer cell lines and multiple myeloma cell lines. 
Due to the central role of aberrant STAT3 signaling in cancer pathogenesis, this 
compound may provide a useful starting point for the development of chemical
scaffolds to block STAT3 signaling for cancer therapy.

The t(14;19)(q32;q13) involving the IGH@ and BCL3 loci is an infrequent
cytogenetic abnormality detected in B-cell malignancies. We describe the
clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic characteristics of 14 cases
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with
t(14;19)(q32;q13). All patients (10 men and 4 women) had lymphocytosis; 10 had
lymphadenopathy. Blood and bone marrow lymphocytes were predominantly small, but 
cytologically and immunophenotypically atypical. In all cases, t(14;19) was found
in the neoplastic stem line; it was the sole abnormality in 4. Ten cases showed
additional cytogenetic abnormalities, including trisomy 12 in 9 and complex
karyotypes in 7. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated IGH@/BCL3 fusion
gene in all cases. In all cases, the IGHV genes were unmutated, but only 7
expressed ZAP70. Seven cases preferentially used IGHV4-39. Our results indicate
that t(14;19)(q32;q13) identifies a subset of CLL/SLL with distinctive
clinicopathologic and genetic features. Furthermore, t(14;19) may represent an
early, possibly primary, genetic event.

We report on a theoretical study of the gas-phase decomposition of boron
trichloride in the presence of hydrogen radicals using ab initio energetic
calculations coupled to TST, RRKM, and VTST-VRC kinetic calculations. In
particular, we present an addition-elimination mechanism (BCl(3) + H <U+2192> BHCl(2) + 
Cl) allowing for a much more rapid consumption of BCl(3) than the direct
abstraction reaction (BCl(3) + H <U+2192> BCl(2) + HCl) considered up to now. At low
temperatures, T = 800 K, our results show that a weakly stabilized complex
BHCl(3) is formed with a kinetic law compatible with the consumption rate
measured in the former experiments. At higher temperatures, this complex is not
stable and then easily eliminates a chlorine atom. Our work also shows that a
very similar mechanism, involving the same intermediate and sharing the same
transition state, allows for the elimination of HCl. A dividing coefficient
between these two elimination pathways is obtained from both a potential energy
surface based statistical analysis and an ab initio molecular dynamics transition
path sampling simulation. It finally allows partitioning of the global
consumption rate of BCl(3) in terms of the formation of (i) BHCl(3), (ii) BHCl(2)
+ Cl through a H addition/Cl elimination mechanism, (iii) BCl(2) + HCl through a 
H addition/HCl elimination mechanism, and (iv) BCl(2) + HCl through direct
abstraction.

103. Modulators of STAT Transcription Factors for the Targeted Therapy of Cancer
(STAT3 Activators).

The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of
transcription factors transduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli, 
and are important mediators of inflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and 
proliferation. STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and 
G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases. Although structurally
similar, the seven STAT family members possess diverse biological roles. For
example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3
activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic. Studies show that STAT3 is
activated in a majority of breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition
using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell
proliferation, survival, and wound healing. Further, blocking STAT3 interaction
with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using peptide aptamers has been 
shown to reduce tumor growth. Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes
associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective potentiators of
STAT3 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and
inflammatory diseases. In response to the chief goal of this project, the
identified small molecular probe ML115 (CID-619100 is a potent and selective
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), with a low nanomolar EC50 for STAT3, and is
inactive against the related STAT1 and NF<U+03BA>B anti-targets. QPCR experiments
further confirm that the probe upregulates transcription of the oncogene BCL3. In
addition, the probe does not exhibit cytotoxicity in the parental cell lines used
for the STAT3 assay (HT-1080) and STAT1 assay (NIH-3T3).

PURPOSE: To determine the recurring DNA copy number alterations (CNA) in
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) by microarray-based comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) using laser capture microdissected CD30(+) Hodgkin and
Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Archived tissues from 27 CD30(+) HL plus control samples
were analyzed by DNA microarrays. The HL molecular karyotypes were compared with 
the genomic profiles of germinal center B cells and treatment outcome
(chemotherapy responsive vs. primary refractory disease).
RESULTS: Gains and losses observed in more than 35% of HL samples were localized 
to 22 and 12 chromosomal regions, respectively. Frequent gains (>65%) were
associated with growth and proliferation, NF-<U+03BA>B activation, cell-cycle control,
apoptosis, and immune and lymphoid development. Frequent losses (>40%) observed
encompassed tumor suppressor genes (SPRY1, NELL1, and ID4, inhibitor of DNA
binding 4), transcriptional repressors (TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting protein), 
SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2; ubiquitin ligase component), and an
antagonist of NF-<U+03BA>B activation (PPARGC1A). In comparison to the germinal center
profiles, the most frequent imbalances in HL were losses in 5p13 (AMACR, GDNF,
and SKP2), and gains in 7q36 (SHH, sonic hedgehog homolog) and 9q34 (ABL1, CDK9, 
LCN2, and PTGES). Gains (>35%) in the HL chemoresponsive patients housed genes
known to regulate T-cell trafficking or NF-<U+03BA>B activation (CCL22, CX3CL1, CCL17,
DOK4, and IL10), whereas the refractory samples showed frequent loss of 4q27
(interleukin; IL21/IL2) and 17p12, and gain of 19q13.3 (BCL3/RELB).
CONCLUSION: We identified nonrandom CNAs in the molecular karyotypes of classical
HL. Several recurring genetic lesions correlated with disease outcome. These
findings may be useful prognostic markers in the counseling and management of
patients and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in primary
refractory HL.

The maintenance of viable and functional islets is critical in successful
pancreatic islet transplantation from cadaveric sources. During the isolation
procedure, islets are exposed to a number of insults including ischemia,
oxidative stress and cytokine injury that cause a reduction in the recovered
viable islet mass. A novel approach was designed in which streptozotocin
(STZ)-damaged rat pancreatic islets (rPIs) were indirectly cocultured with rat
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBM-MSCs) to maintain survival of the
cultured rPIs. The results indicated that islets cocultured with rBM-MSCs
secreted an increased level of insulin after 14 days, whereas non-cocultured
islets gradually deteriorated and cell death occurred. The cocultivation of
rBM-MSCs with islets and STZ-damaged islets showed the expression of IL6 and
transforming growth factor-ß1 in the culture medium, besides the expression of
the antiapoptotic genes (Mapkapk2, Tnip1 and Bcl3), implying the cytoprotective, 
anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of rBM-SCs through paracrine actions.

Specific chromosomal IG translocations have different prognoses in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia.

C, Maloum K, Davi F, Merle-Béral H.

BACKGROUND: Chromosomal translocations are usually analyzed as a single entity,
and are associated with a poor outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Translocations involving immunoglobulin genes are recurrent, but uncommon (<5%), 
and their individual prognosis is not clear. The two most frequent partners are
BCL2 (18q21) and BCL3 (19q13).
DESIGNS AND METHODS: Herein, 75 cases are reported of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia and t(14;18) (BCL2-CLLs). Our series benefits from morphological,
immunological and cytogenetical reviews. The IGHV status analyses were performed 
by referring laboratories. Comparison was made with our previously published
series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with t(14;19) (BCL3-CLLs, n=29).
RESULTS: Compared with BCL3-CLLs, lymphocytosis was lower in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.008),
and splenomegaly was less frequent (p<0.0001). There were more "typical"
morphologies (p<0.005) and Matutes scores >4 (p<0.001) in the BCL2-CLLs group,
and less CD38 expression (p<0.04). More variant BCL2-translocations were observed
(t(18;22), n=11; 2t(2;18), n=2; p<0.02), and BCL2-translocation was frequently
single (p<0.002). Complex karyotypes (p<0.02), trisomy 12 (p<0.03), 6q deletion
(p<0.002) and TP53 deletion (p<0.02) were less frequent in BCL2-CLLs, whereas 13q
deletion was more frequent (p<0.005). The IGHV gene was frequently mutated in
BCL2-CLLs (p<0.0001). Treatment-free survival was longer in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: BCL2-CLL.S express CD5 and lack expression of CD38, and have a
Matutes score =4, frequent trisomy 12, no ATM and 6q deletions, and a mutated
IGHV status. Compared to BCL3-CLLs, BCL2-CLLs are much less aggressive;
indicating that identifying individual translocations and cytogenetic partners
would allow improved patient stratification.

Bcl3 prevents acute inflammatory lung injury in mice by restraining emergency
granulopoiesis.

Granulocytes are pivotal regulators of tissue injury. However, the
transcriptional mechanisms that regulate granulopoiesis under inflammatory
conditions are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcriptional
coregulator B cell leukemia/lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) limits granulopoiesis under
emergency (i.e., inflammatory) conditions, but not homeostatic conditions.
Treatment of mouse myeloid progenitors with G-CSF--serum concentrations of which 
rise under inflammatory conditions--rapidly increased Bcl3 transcript
accumulation in a STAT3-dependent manner. Bcl3-deficient myeloid progenitors
demonstrated an enhanced capacity to proliferate and differentiate into
granulocytes following G-CSF stimulation, whereas the accumulation of Bcl3
protein attenuated granulopoiesis in an NF-<U+03BA>B p50-dependent manner. In a
clinically relevant model of transplant-mediated lung ischemia reperfusion
injury, expression of Bcl3 in recipients inhibited emergency granulopoiesis and
limited acute graft damage. These data demonstrate a critical role for Bcl3 in
regulating emergency granulopoiesis and suggest that targeting the
differentiation of myeloid progenitors may be a therapeutic strategy for
preventing inflammatory lung injury.

BACKGROUND: Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are crucial intermediates in the
generation of both innate and specific immune responses. It has long been
understood that some APCs are resident in islets in situ as well as after
isolation. Our aim was to investigate the presence of molecules involved in
antigen presentation in rat pancreatic islet-derived stem cells (PI-SCs).
METHODS: We used immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription polymerization
chain reaction to study immunophenotypic characteristics; pluripotent-related
gene expressions; transcripts coding for antigen-presenting surface proteins
CD40, CD80, CD86; and major histocompatibility complex class II in addition to
genes with known antiapoptotic functions including mitogen-activated protein
kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2), tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced
protein 3 (TNFAIP3) interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) and BCL3 of the PI-SCs.
RESULTS: Rat PI-SCs were negative for CD45 as demonstrated by flow cytometry and 
for CD31, CD34, and CD71 as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Therefore, there
was no evidence of hematopoietic precursors in the cultures. OCT4, SOX2, and REX1
were expressed by rat PI-SCs. We determined the expression of genes for
antigen-presenting surface proteins CD40 and CD80, and genes with known
antiapoptotic functions including MAPKAPK2, TNIP1 and BCL3, besides the surface
protein, CD80, by flow cytometry.
CONCLUSION: Expression of these genes by rat PI-SCs implied that they could be
involved in the regulation of immunity in islets, highlighting the influence of
protective role-playing antiapoptotic mechanisms on pancreatic islet cells. This 
study offers the potential to understand the molecular mechanisms of a
devastating disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus.

BCL3 is a putative proto-oncogene deregulated in haematopoieitic and solid
tumours. It has been suggested that its oncogenic effects could be mediated, at
least in part, by inducing proliferation and inhibiting cell death. To provide
more insight into the mediators of these effects, we used an unbiased approach to
analyse the mRNA expression changes after knocking-down BCL3 using specific
shRNAs. One hundred eighty genes were up-regulated and sixtynine genes were
down-regulated after knocking down BCL3. Function analyses showed enrichment in
genes associated with cellular growth and proliferation, cell death and gene
expression. We found that STAT3, an important oncogene in human cancer, was the
central node of one of the most significant networks. We validated STAT3 as a
bona fide target of BCL3 by additional interference RNA and in silico analyses of
previously reported lymphoma patients.

Bcl3-dependent stabilization of CtBP1 is crucial for the inhibition of apoptosis

B-cell lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) is a proto-oncogene upregulated in a wide range of
cancers, including breast cancer. Although Bcl3 is known to promote cell
proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
proto-oncogenic function of Bcl3 have not been completely elucidated. To gain
insight into the oncogenic role of Bcl3, we applied a proteomic approach, which
led to the identification of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) as a binding
partner of Bcl3. A PXDLS/R motif embedded in Bcl3 was found to mediate the
interaction between Bcl3 and CtBP1, which caused the stabilization of CtBP1 by
blocking proteasome-dependent degradation. Apoptotic stimuli-induced degradation 
of CtBP1 was significantly abolished by the upregulation of Bcl3, leading to the 
sustained repression of pro-apoptotic gene expression and subsequent inhibition
of apoptosis. Intriguingly, a strong positive correlation between the protein
levels of Bcl3 and CtBP1 was detected in breast cancer patient samples. Our study
reveals a novel combinatorial role for Bcl3 and CtBP1, providing an explanation
for the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells, which is a major 
requirement for cancer development.

MiR-125b targets BCL3 and suppresses ovarian cancer proliferation.

Guan Y(1), Yao H, Zheng Z, Qiu G, Sun K.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Genetics, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.

Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) important for post-transcriptional gene expression as
negative regulators are endogenous 21- to 23-nucleotide noncoding RNAs. Many
miRNAs are expressed in ovarian cancer (OC). In this study, we reported that
miR-125b was underexpressed in human OC specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-125b
in OC cells induced cell cycle arrest and led to reduction in proliferation and
clonal formation. This inhibitory effect on OC cell growth was mediated by
miR-125b inhibition of the translation of an mRNA encoding a proto-oncogene,
BCL3. Furthermore, expression of miR-125b suppressed the tumor formation
generated by injecting OC cells in nude mice. Our results suggest that aberrantly
expressed miR-125b may contribute to OC development.

OBJECTIVE: It has long been recognized that autoimmunity is often associated with
immunodeficiency. The mechanism underlying this paradox is not well understood.
Bcl-3 (B-cell lymphoma 3) is an atypical member of the I<U+03BA>B (inhibitor of the
nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B) family that is required for lymphoid organogenesis and
germinal center responses. Mice deficient in Bcl-3 are immunodeficient because of
the microarchitectural defects of their lymphoid organs. The goal of this study
is to define the potential roles of Bcl-3 in type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Bcl-3-deficient NOD mice were generated by
backcrossing Bcl-3-deficient C57BL/6 mice to NOD mice. Spontaneous and induced
type 1 diabetes were studied in these mice by both pathologic and immunologic
means. The effect of Bcl-3 on inflammatory gene transcription was evaluated in a 
promoter reporter assay.
RESULTS: We found that Bcl-3-deficient NOD and C57BL/6 mice were, paradoxically, 
more susceptible to autoimmune diabetes than wild-type mice. The increase in
diabetes susceptibility was caused by Bcl-3 deficiency in hematopoietic cells but
not nonhematopoietic cells. Bcl-3 deficiency did not significantly affect
anti-islet Th1 or Th2 autoimmune responses, but markedly increased inflammatory
chemokine and T helper 17 (Th17)-type cytokine expression. Upon transfection,
Bcl-3 significantly inhibited the promoter activities of inflammatory chemokine
and cytokine genes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in addition to mediating lymphoid
organogenesis, Bcl-3 prevents autoimmune diabetes by inhibiting inflammatory
chemokine and cytokine gene transcription. Thus, a single Bcl3 gene mutation
leads to both autoimmunity and immunodeficiency.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for Crohn's disease (CD) have identified
loci explaining approximately 20% of the total genetic risk of CD. Part of the
other genetic risk loci is probably partly hidden among signals discarded by the 
multiple testing correction needed in the analysis of GWAS data. Strategies for
finding these hidden loci require large replication cohorts and are costly to
perform. We adopted a strategy of selecting SNPs for follow-up that showed a
correlation to gene expression [cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)]
since these have been shown more likely to be trait-associated. First we show
that there is an overrepresentation of cis-eQTLs in the known CD-associated loci.
Then SNPs were selected for follow-up by screening the top 500 SNP hits from a CD
GWAS data set. We identified 10 cis-eQTL SNPs. These 10 SNPs were tested for
association with CD in two independent cohorts of Dutch CD patients (1539) and
healthy controls (2648). In a combined analysis, we identified two cis-eQTL SNPs 
that were associated with CD rs2298428 in UBE2L3 (P=5.22x10(-5)) and rs2927488 in
BCL3 (P=2.94x10(-4)). After adding additional publicly available data from a
previously reported meta-analysis, the association with rs2298428 almost reached 
genome-wide significance (P=2.40x10(-7)) and the association with rs2927488 was
corroborated (P=6.46x10(-4)). We have identified UBE2L3 and BCL3 as likely novel 
risk genes for CD. UBE2L3 is also associated with other immune-mediated diseases.
These results show that eQTL-based pre-selection for follow-up is a useful
approach for identifying risk loci from a moderately sized GWAS.

Recent studies suggest that multiple interacting loci, with possible additional
environmental factors, influence the risk for nonsyndromic oral clefts, one of
the most common birth defects in humans. Advances in high-throughput genotyping
technology allow the testing of multiple markers, simultaneously, in many
candidate genes. We tested for associations between 176 haplotype-tagging single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 candidate genes/loci and nonsyndromic
clefts in a case-control study in an Estonian sample (153 patients, 205
controls). The most significant associations with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or 
without cleft palate (CL/P) were found for SNPs in MSX1, MTHFR, and PVRL2,
including several common haplotypes in the MTHFR and MSX1 genes. The strongest
association was observed for rs6446693 in the MSX1 region, which remained
statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. The strongest association 
with nonsyndromic cleft palate (CP) was found for the SNP rs11624283 in the JAG2 
gene. Epistatic interactions were observed for SNPs within PVRL2, between BCL3
and EDN1, and between IRF6 and MSX1 genes. This study provides further evidence
implicating MSX1 and MTHFR in the etiology of nonsyndromic CL/P across different 
populations.

Both arsenic trioxide (ATO) and bortezomib show separate antileukemic activity.
With the purpose of evaluating whether the combination of ATO and bortezomib
would be an option for patients with acute leukemia, we incubated HL60 leukemic
cells with ATO alone and in combination with bortezomib. ATO and bortezomib
cooperated to induce cell death and to inhibit proliferation and apoptosis in a
synergistic way. The combined treatment resulted in a stronger activation of
caspase 8 and 9, moderate activation of caspase 3, and increased expression of
Fas and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-DR5
receptors. When bortezomib was added, some proapoptotic genes (CARD9, TRAIL) were
upregulated, and some antiapoptotic genes (BCL2, BCL3, FLICE) were downregulated.
When coincubated, approximately 80% of cells showed altered mitochondrial
membrane permeability. Moreover, ATO alone and in combination with bortezomib
abrogated DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappaB). Gene
expression assays showed that more deregulated genes were related to
proliferation of leukocytes, tumorigenesis, control of cell cycle, hypoxia and
oxidative stress, cytokines, PI3K-AKT, ERK-MAPK, EGF pathways, and
ubiquitination. Finally, in three cases of acute myeloid leukemia, the addition
of bortezomib to ATO significantly increased cytotoxicity. We conclude that the
combination of bortezomib and ATO may be efficacious in the treatment of myeloid 
disorders.

Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
oncoprotein Tax increases Bcl3 expression, which is associated with enhanced
growth of HTLV-1-infected T cells.

Bcl3 is a member of the IkappaB family that regulates genes involved in cell
proliferation and apoptosis. Recent reports indicated that Bcl3 is overexpressed 
in HTLV-1-infected T cells via Tax-mediated transactivation, and acts as a
negative regulator of viral transcription. However, the role of Bcl3 in cellular 
signal transduction and the growth of HTLV-1-infected T cells have not been
reported. In this study, we showed that the knockdown of Bcl3 by short hairpin
RNA inhibited the growth of HTLV-1-infected T cells. Although
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor reduced Bcl3 expression,
inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), an effector kinase of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, restored Bcl3 expression in Tax-negative but not in
Tax-positive T cells. Our results indicate that the overexpression of Bcl3 in
HTLV-1-infected T cells is regulated not only by transcriptional but also by
post-transcriptional mechanisms, and is involved in overgrowth of HTLV-1-infected
T cells.

p52-Bcl3 complex promotes cyclin D1 expression in BEAS-2B cells in response to
low concentration arsenite.

Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.

Arsenic is a well-recognized human carcinogen that causes a number of malignant
diseases, including lung cancer. Previous studies have indicated that cyclin D1
is frequently over-expressed in many cancer types. It is also known that arsenite
exposure enhances cyclin D1 expression, which involves NF-kappaB activation.
However, the mechanism between cyclin D1 and the NF-kappaB pathway has not been
well studied. This study was designed to characterize the underlying mechanism of
induced cell growth and cyclin D1 expression in response to low concentration
sodium arsenic (NaAsO(2)) exposure through the NF-kappaB pathway. Cultured human 
bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, were exposed to low concentration sodium
arsenite for the indicated durations, and cytotoxicity, gene expression, and
protein activity were assessed. To profile the canonical and non-canonical
NF-kappaB pathways involved in cell growth and cyclin D1 expression induced by
low concentration arsenite, the NF-kappaB-specific inhibitor-phenethyl caffeate
(CAPE) and NF-kappaB2 mRNA target sequences were used, and cyclin D1 expression
in BEAS-2B cells was assessed. Our results demonstrated that exposure to low
concentration arsenite enhanced BEAS-2B cells growth and cyclin D1 mRNA and
protein expression. Activation and nuclear localization of p52 and Bcl3 in
response to low concentration arsenite indicated that the non-canonical NF-kappaB
pathway was involved in arsenite-induced cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, we
further demonstrated that p52/Bcl3 complex formation enhanced cyclin D1
expression through the cyclin D1 gene promoter via its kappaB site. The
up-regulation of cyclin D1 mediated by the p52-Bcl3 complex in response to low
concentration arsenite might be important in assessing the health risk of low
concentration arsenite and understanding the mechanisms of the harmful effects of
arsenite.

The first ene reactions of SO(2) and unfunctionalized alkenes are reported.
Calculations suggest that the endergonic ene reactions of SO(2) with alkenes can 
be used to generate beta,gamma-unsaturated sulfinyl and sulfonyl compounds.
Indeed, in the presence of one equivalent of BCl(3), the unstable sulfinic acid
form stable sulfinic acid.BCl(3) complexes that can be reacted in situ with NCS
to generate corresponding sulfonyl chlorides, or with a base to generate
corresponding sulfinates. The latter can be reacted with electrophiles to
generate sulfones, or with silyl chloride to form beta,gamma-unsaturated silyl
sulfinates. The sulfinic acid.BCl(3) complexes can be reacted with ethers that
act as oxygen nucleophiles to produce corresponding sulfinic esters. Thus
one-pot, three-component synthesis of beta,gamma-unsaturated sulfonamides,
sulfinyl esters and sulfones have been developed starting from alkenes and sulfur
dioxide (reagent and solvent).

University, Canberra, ACT2601, Australia. yuan.zhu@anu.edu.au

AIM: Hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor degeneration occurs preferentially in the
inferior retina of C57BL/6 J mice. This study investigates differential gene
expression in the inferior and superior retina of C57BL/6 J mouse, before and
after hyperoxic stress.
METHODS: At the age of P (postnatal day) 83-90, mice were placed in constant
normoxia or hyperoxia (75% O(2)) for 2 weeks. Retinas from control and exposed
mice were removed and RNA was extracted from superior and inferior regions. The
RNA from 2 animals (1 male and 1 female) at each condition was extracted,
purified and hybridized to an Affymetrix MouseGene 1.0 ST Array to elucidate gene
expression. Experiments were run in triplicate and analysis of the expression
patterns was performed using GeneSpring and Partek Genomics Suite softwares.
RESULTS: Over 400 genes showed significant differential expression by location
and treatment using 2-way ANOVA analysis. In the control material, no genes
showed a differential expression greater than twofold between inferior and
superior retina. After hyperoxic stress, 154 genes in the inferior and 30 genes
in the superior retina showed a greater than twofold change in expression. Among 
those, genes such as Edn2, GFAP, Bcl3 and C1qb showed expression differences of
greater than three fold between inferior and superior retina. Real time PCR was
used to verify gene expression of control genes as well as genes of interest.
CONCLUSION: These microarray data may provide clues for identifying previously
unknown factors and pathways responsible for the vulnerability of inferior retina
to hyperoxic stress and for the eventual identification of therapeutic targets.

Interleukin-2 induces NF-kappaB activation through BCL10 and affects its
subcellular localization in natural killer lymphoma cells.

Deregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signalling is common in cancers and is
essential for tumourigenesis. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation in extranodal
natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL) is known to be associated
with aberrant nuclear translocation of BCL10. Here we investigated the mechanisms
leading to NF-kappaB activation and BCL10 nuclear localization in ENKLs. Given
that ENKLs are dependent on T-cell-derived interleukin-2 (IL2) for cytotoxicity
and proliferation, we investigated whether IL2 modulates NF-kappaB activation and
BCL10 subcellular localization in ENKLs. In the present study, IL2-activated NK
lymphoma cells were found to induce NF-kappaB activation via the PI3K/Akt
pathway, leading to an increase in the entry of G(2)/M phase and concomitant
transcription of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. We also found that BCL10, a key
mediator of NF-kappaB signalling, participates in the cytokine receptor-induced
activation of NF-kappaB. Knockdown of BCL10 expression resulted in deficient
NF-kappaB signalling, whereas Akt activation was unaffected. Our results suggest 
that BCL10 plays a role downstream of Akt in the IL2-triggered NF-kappaB
signalling pathway. Moreover, the addition of IL2 to NK cells led to aberrant
nuclear translocation of BCL10, which is a pathological feature of ENKLs. We
further show that BCL10 can bind to BCL3, a transcriptional co-activator and
nuclear protein. Up-regulation of BCL3 expression was observed in response to
IL2. Similar to BCL10, the expression and nuclear translocation of BCL3 were
induced by IL2 in an Akt-dependent manner. The nuclear translocation of BCL10 was
also dependent on BCL3 because silencing BCL3 by RNA interference abrogated this 
translocation. We identified a critical role for BCL10 in the cytokine
receptor-induced NF-kappaB signalling pathway, which is essential for NK cell
activation. We also revealed the underlying mechanism that controls BCL10 nuclear
translocation in NK cells. Our findings provide insight into a molecular network 
within the NF-kappaB signalling pathway that promotes the pathogenesis of NK cell
lymphomas.

The NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 induces cell cycle progression and
proliferation of melanoma cells.

Vancouver, BC Canada.

The oxidoreductase NQO1 plays a prominent role in maintaining the cellular
homeostasis. NQO1 is mainly a cytosolic enzyme which catalyzes the metabolism of 
quinones and is present in almost all tissue types providing protection against
different stresses including xenobiotics, oxidants, UV light, and ionizing
radiation. This enzyme is overexpressed in many cancerous tissues and its
function in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Due to the relative lack of
information on the role of NQO1 in melanoma pathogenesis, we attempted to
determine the expression and basic function of NQO1 in melanoma cell
proliferation. We found that NQO1 is overexpressed in most melanoma cell lines
with respect to melanocytes. Furthermore, the expression of this oxidoreductase
significantly induces cell cycle progression by upregulating the expression of
cyclins A2, B1 and D1, leading to the proliferation of melanoma cells. Our
results also indicate that NQO1 is an upstream regulator of NF-kappaB p50, a
factor linked to melanoma progression and poor patient prognosis. Interestingly, 
we found that NQO1 stabilizes the transactivator BCL3, which in turn upregulates 
NF-kappaB p50. More importantly, our results also indicate that NF-kappaB p50
correlates with the expression of NQO1 and mediates its role in the proliferation
of melanoma cells.

Energy-conversion properties of vapor-liquid-solid-grown silicon wire-array
photocathodes.

Silicon wire arrays, though attractive materials for use in photovoltaics and as 
photocathodes for hydrogen generation, have to date exhibited poor performance.
Using a copper-catalyzed, vapor-liquid-solid-growth process, SiCl4 and BCl3 were 
used to grow ordered arrays of crystalline p-type silicon (p-Si) microwires on
p+-Si(111) substrates. When these wire arrays were used as photocathodes in
contact with an aqueous methyl viologen(2+/+) electrolyte, energy-conversion
efficiencies of up to 3% were observed for monochromatic 808-nanometer light at
fluxes comparable to solar illumination, despite an external quantum yield at
short circuit of only 0.2. Internal quantum yields were at least 0.7,
demonstrating that the measured photocurrents were limited by light absorption in
the wire arrays, which filled only 4% of the incident optical plane in our test
devices. The inherent performance of these wires thus conceptually allows the
development of efficient photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical energy-conversion 
devices based on a radial junction platform.

Defining the borders of splenic marginal zone lymphoma: a multiparameter study.

Classic splenic marginal zone lymphomas are CD5-, CD10-, CD23-, CD43-, and
usually IgD+ with biphasic white pulp nodules. However, the 2008 World Health
Organization classification accepts splenic marginal zone lymphomas with
monophasic marginal zone-like white pulp nodules and recognizes a group of
unclassifiable splenic small B-cell lymphomas. To explore the relationship of
classic splenic marginal zone lymphomas to these other less well-defined splenic 
lymphomas, a multiparameter study of 47 splenic marginal zone lymphomas and
unclassifiable splenic small B-cell lymphomas was performed. Seventeen of 31
splenic marginal zone lymphomas were biphasic, and 14 were monophasic (90%-100%
marginal zone-like white pulp nodules). Sixteen cases were unclassifiable splenic
small B-cell lymphomas, most lacking a marginal zone-type component. There were
many clinical similarities between the 3 groups, including similar survivals.
Monophasic and unclassifiable cases were less likely to have a typical splenic
marginal zone lymphoma phenotype (28.6%, 23.1%) compared with biphasic cases
(86.7%), usually because of IgD negativity (P < .003). Thirty-four of 42 (81%)
cases had cytogenetic abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization; and 17
of 20 (85%), by classical cytogenetics. The most frequent fluorescence in situ
hybridization abnormalities among the splenic marginal zone lymphomas were
del(7)(q31) (26%), +12 (25%), and +3q27 (27%); and among the unclassifiable
cases, +12 (50%) and +3q27 (36%). Five of 6 unclassifiable cases with exclusively
small non-marginal zone-like lymphocytes involving both white and red pulp had
+12 compared with 9 of 34 other cases (P < .02). CDK6 (2 cases) and BCL3 (1 case)
rearrangements were only seen in the unclassifiable group. These results support 
including both biphasic and monophasic cases as splenic marginal zone lymphomas, 
but suggest that the lack of a non-marginal zone-like population in the
monophasic group is associated with some biologic differences. They also
demonstrate a relatively large proportion of unclassifiable cases, including a
group with frequent +12.

Blood lipids are important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors with both
genetic and environmental determinants. The Whitehall II study (n=5592) was
genotyped with the gene-centric HumanCVD BeadChip (Illumina). We identified 195
SNPs in 16 genes/regions associated with 3 major lipid fractions and 2
apolipoprotein components at p<10(-5), with the associations being broadly
concordant with prior genome-wide analysis. SNPs associated with LDL cholesterol 
and apolipoprotein B were located in LDLR, PCSK9, APOB, CELSR2, HMGCR, CETP, the 
TOMM40-APOE-C1-C2-C4 cluster, and the APOA5-A4-C3-A1 cluster; SNPs associated
with HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI were in CETP, LPL, LIPC,
APOA5-A4-C3-A1, and ABCA1; and SNPs associated with triglycerides in GCKR, BAZ1B,
MLXIPL, LPL, and APOA5-A4-C3-A1. For 48 SNPs in previously unreported loci that
were significant at p<10(-4) in Whitehall II, in silico analysis including the
British Women's Heart and Health Study, BRIGHT, ASCOT, and NORDIL studies (total 
n>12,500) revealed previously unreported associations of SH2B3 (p<2.2x10(-6)),
BMPR2 (p<2.3x10(-7)), BCL3/PVRL2 (flanking APOE; p<4.4x10(-8)), and SMARCA4
(flanking LDLR; p<2.5x10(-7)) with LDL cholesterol. Common alleles in these genes
explained 6.1%-14.7% of the variance in the five lipid-related traits, and
individuals at opposite tails of the additive allele score exhibited substantial 
differences in trait levels (e.g., >1 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol [approximately 1 
SD of the trait distribution]). These data suggest that multiple common alleles
of small effect can make important contributions to individual differences in
blood lipids potentially relevant to the assessment of CVD risk. These genes

This study examined the etch characteristics of ZrO2 etched using an atomic layer
etching (ALET) system with BCl3 gas for adsorption and an Ar neutral beam for
desorption. The effect of the BCl3 gas pressure and Ar neutral beam dose on the
etch characteristics was examined. The results showed that the ZrO2 etch rate was
maintained at a constant etch rate of 1.07 angstroms/cycle at a BCl3 gas pressure
> 0.15 mTorr and an Ar beam flux > 1.485 x 1016 atoms/cm2 x cycle. Under these
constant etch rate conditions, the surface roughness of the etched ZrO2 was
similar to that of the as-received ZrO2. The surface composition of ZrO2 etched
by ALET was compared with that etched by BCl3 inductively coupled plasma (ICP).
The surface composition of ZrO2 etched by ALET showed a similar composition to
that of the as-received ZrO2 while that etched by BCl3 ICP showed a Zr-rich
surface.

Clonorchis sinensis, the parasite that causes clonorchiasis, is endemic in many
Asian countries, and infection with the organism drives changes in the liver
tissues of the host. However, information regarding the molecular events in
clonorchiasis remains limited, and little is currently known about host-pathogen 
interactions in clonorchiasis. In this study, we assessed the gene expression
profiles in mice livers via DNA microarray analysis 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after
induced metacercariae infection. Functional clustering of the gene expression
profile showed that the immunity-involved genes were induced in the livers of the
mice at the early stage of metacercariae infection, whereas immune responses were
reduced in the 6-week liver tissues after infection in which the metacercariae
became adult flukes. Many genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including
Peci, Cyp4a10, Acat1, Ehhadh, Gcdh, and Cyp2 family were downregulated in the
infected livers. On the other hand, the liver tissues infected with the parasite 
expressed Wnt signaling molecules such as Wnt7b, Fzd6, and Pdgfrb and cell
cycle-regulating genes including cyclin-D1, Cdca3, and Bcl3. These investigations
constitute an excellent starting point for increased understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interaction during the development 
of C. sinensis in the host liver.

Bcl3 interacts cooperatively with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator 1alpha to coactivate nuclear receptors
estrogen-related receptor alpha and PPARalpha.

Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) play critical roles in regulation of cellular
energy metabolism in response to inducible coactivators such as peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator 1alpha
(PGC-1alpha). A yeast two-hybrid screen led to the identification of the
cytokine-stimulated transcriptional regulator, Bcl3, as an ERRalpha coactivator. 
Bcl3 was shown to synergize with PGC-1alpha to coactivate ERRalpha. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that ERRalpha, PGC-1alpha, and Bcl3 form
a complex on an ERRalpha-responsive element within the pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase 4 gene promoter in cardiac myocytes. Mapping studies demonstrated that
Bc13 interacts with PGC-1alpha and ERRalpha, allowing for interaction with both
proteins. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Bcl3 activates genes
involved in diverse pathways including a subset involved in cellular energy
metabolism known to be regulated by PGC-1alpha, ERRalpha, and a second nuclear
receptor, PPARalpha. Consistent with the gene expression profiling results, Bcl3 
was shown to synergistically coactivate PPARalpha with PGC-1alpha in a manner
similar to ERRalpha. We propose that the cooperativity between Bcl3 and
PGC-1alpha may serve as a point of convergence on nuclear receptor targets to
direct programs orchestrating inflammatory and energy metabolism responses in
heart and other tissues.

Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma occurring during pregnancy with a novel
translocation involving chromosome 19: a case report with review of the
literature.

Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. armahh2@upmc.edu

The recently recognized renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) associated with Xp11.2
translocations (TFE3 transcription factor gene fusions) are rare tumors
predominantly reported in children. They comprise at least one-third of pediatric
RCCs and only few adult cases have been reported. Here, we present a case of
Xp11.2 translocation RCC in 26-year-old pregnant female. Her routine antenatal
ultrasonography accidentally found a complex cystic right renal mass. Further
radiologic studies revealed unilocular cyst with multiple mural nodules at
inferior pole of right kidney, which was suspicious for RCC. She underwent right 
radical nephrectomy at 15 weeks gestation. Macroscopically, the cystic tumor was 
well encapsulated with multiple friable mural nodules on its inner surface.
Microscopically, the tumor consisted of clear and eosinophilic/oncocytic
voluminous cells arranged in papillary, trabecular, and nested/alveolar patterns.
Occasional hyaline nodules and numerous psammoma bodies were
present.Immunohistochemically, the tumor showed strong nuclear positivity for
TFE3. Epithelial membrane antigen, CD10, and E-cadherin were strongly positive.
Cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin CAM-5.2, calveolin, and parvalbumin were
moderately positive. Cytokeratin 7, renal cell carcinoma antigen, and colloidal
iron were focally weakly positive. BerEP4 and carbonic anhydrase IX were
negative. Cytogenetically, the tumor harbored a novel variant translocation
involving chromosomes X and 19, t(X;19)(p11.2;q13.1). Interphase FISH analysis
performed on cultured and uncultured tumor cells using a dual-color break-apart
DNA probe within the BCL3 gene on 19q13.3 was negative for the BCL3 gene
rearrangement. She received no adjuvant therapy, delivered a normal term baby
five months later, and is alive without evidence of disease 27 months after
diagnosis and surgery. Unlike most recently reported Xp11.2 translocation RCCs in
adult patients with aggressive clinical course, this adult case occurring during 
pregnancy with a novel translocation involving chromosome 19 followed an indolent
clinical course.

Differential parental transmission of markers in BCL3 among Korean cleft
case-parent trios.

OBJECTIVES: Isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is among the
most common human birth defects, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 700 live
births. The B-Cell Leukemia/lymphoma 3 (BCL3) gene has been suggested as a
candidate gene for CL/P based on association and linkage studies in some
populations. This study tests for an association between markers in BCL3 and
isolated, non-syndromic CL/P using a case-parent trio design, while considering
parent-of-origin effects.
METHODS: Forty case-parent trios were genotyped for two single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BCL3 gene. We performed a transmission disequilibrium
test (TDT) on individual SNPs, and the FAMHAP package was used to estimate
haplotype frequencies and to test for excess transmission of multi-SNP
haplotypes.
RESULTS: The odds ratio for transmission of the minor allele, OR (transmission), 
was significant for SNP rs8100239 (OR=3.50, p=0.004) and rs2965169 (OR=2.08,
p=0.027) when parent-of-origin was not considered. Parent-specific TDT revealed
that SNP rs8100239 showed excess maternal transmission. Analysis of haplotypes of
rs2965169 and rs8100239 also suggested excess maternal transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: BCL3 appears to influence risk of CL/P through a parent-of-origin
effect with excess maternal transmission.

proliferation and inferior prognosis.

Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

BACKGROUND: BCL3 is a putative oncogene encoding for a protein belonging to the
inhibitory kappaB-family. We experienced that this putative oncogene was a common
target gene for growth-promoting cytokines in myeloma cell lines.
METHODS: Gene expression of BCL3 was studied in 351 newly diagnosed myeloma
patients, 12 patients with smouldering myeloma, 44 patients with monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance and 22 healthy individuals. Smaller
material of samples was included for mRNA detection by RT-PCR, protein detection 
by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, and for cytogenetic studies. A total of
eight different myeloma cell lines were studied.
RESULTS: Bcl-3 was induced in myeloma cell lines by interleukin (IL)-6, IL-21,
IL-15, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IGF-1, and its upregulation was associated
with increased proliferation of the cells. In a population of 351 patients,
expression levels of BCL3 above 75th percentile were associated with shorter 5-yr
survival. When this patient population was divided into subgroups based on
molecular classification, BCL3 was significantly increased in a poor risk
subgroup characterized by overexpression of cell cycle and proliferation related 
genes. Intracellular localization of Bcl-3 was dependent on type of stimulus
given to the cell.
CONCLUSION: BCL3 is a common target gene for several growth-promoting cytokines
in myeloma cells and high expression of BCL3 at the time of diagnosis is
associated with poor prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). These data
may indicate a potential oncogenic role for Bcl-3 in MM.

Carbon complexes as electronically and sterically tunable analogues of carbon
monoxide in coordination chemistry.

(1)Philipps-Universität Marburg, Fachbereich Chemie, Hans-Meerwein-Strasse,
D-35032 Marburg, Germany.

Quantum chemical calculations at DFT (BP86) and ab initio levels (CCSD(T)) have
been carried out for transition metal carbon complexes [MX2(PR3)2(C)] with
various combinations of M = Fe, Ru, Os, X = F, Cl, Br, I, and R = H, Me, Ph, Cyc.
Calculations have also been performed for [RuCl2(PMe3)(NHC)(C)] and
[RuCl2(NHC)2(C)] where NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene and for [M(Por)(C)] (M = Fe, 
Ru, Os; Por = porphyrin). The properties of the carbon complexes as donor ligands
were studied by calculating the geometries and bond dissociation energies of the 
Lewis acid-base adducts with the Lewis acids M(CO)5 (M = Cr, Mo, W), PdCl2SMe2,
BH3, BCl3, and Fe2(CO)8. The latter species are compared to the analogous CO
complexes. The nature of the donor-acceptor interactions between the Lewis acids 
LA and carbon complexes [TM]C-LA is compared to the bonding in OC-LA. The bonding
analysis was carried out with charge- and energy-partitioning methods. The bond
strength and the donor-acceptor properties of metal carbon complexes closely
resemble those of CO, and thus carbon complexes may be considered as
electronically tuneable analogues of carbon monoxide. Similar properties are also
calculated for the porphyrin carbon complexes 10MC, which bind more strongly and 
are slightly stronger pi acceptors than the [(X2(R)2M(C)] species. The carbon
complexes [(X2(R)2M(C)] are slightly weaker pi acceptors than CO, and thus they
tend to have slightly weaker bonds than CO in group-6 donor-acceptor complexes.
The calculations suggest that bond energies of carbon complexes as ligands with
d10 transition metals are larger than those of CO. The theoretical results let it
seem possible that adducts with more than one carbon complex as ligands may be
synthesized and that even homoleptic complexes may be prepared.

Chromosomal translocations affecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus
in chromosomal band 14q32 are the most frequent cytogenetic changes in B-cell
lymphomas. We studied the presence of IGH translocations in a consecutively
ascertained series of 94 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHL) by combined
immunofluorescence for CD30 and interphase cytogenetics (FICTION technique). The 
Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of a total of 11 of 87 evaluable cases (13%)
showed signal patterns indicative of IGH translocations. To identify the
translocation partners, these cases were further studied with probes for the MYC,
BCL2, BCL6, BCL3, REL/BCL11A, JAK2/PDCD1LG2 (alias PDL2) C14orf43, and C2TA loci.
The IGH translocation partner could be identified in four cHL and involved BCL2
and BCL3 in two cases each. Immunohistochemistry in cases with suitable material 
revealed that tumor cells of the two cHL with IGH/BCL2 fusion and the cHL with
IGH/BCL3 fusion expressed the BCL2 and BCL3 protein, respectively. These data
indicate that BCL2 or BCL3 are recurrent translocation partners of the IGH locus 
in cHL; however, most of the translocation partners of IGH translocations in cHL 
remain to be identified.

The proto-oncogene Bcl3, induced by Tax, represses Tax-mediated transcription via
p300 displacement from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter.

State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.

The etiology of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-induced adult T-cell 
leukemia is linked to the expression of the viral oncoprotein Tax. Although the
mechanism of retroviral transformation is unknown, Tax interferes with
fundamental cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis, and these 
events may directly link Tax to early steps in malignant progression. In this
study, we examined the interplay between Tax and the potent proto-oncogene B-cell
chronic leukemia protein 3 (Bcl3). Bcl3 is a critical regulator of cell survival 
and proliferation and is overexpressed in HTLV-1-infected cells. We found that
Tax induced Bcl3 expression through stimulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. An
intronic NF-kappaB binding site within the Bcl3 gene served as the primary target
of Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation. We next considered the consequence of Bcl3
overexpression on Tax function. Interestingly, we found that Bcl3 formed a stable
complex with Tax and that this complex potently inhibited Tax-dependent HTLV-1
transcription. Importantly, Bcl3 associated with the HTLV-1 promoter in a
Tax-dependent manner and inhibited the binding of the critical cellular
coactivator p300. The conserved ankyrin repeat domain of Bcl3 mediated both Tax
binding and inhibition of p300 recruitment to the HTLV-1 promoter. Together,
these data suggest that Tax-induced Bcl3 overexpression benefits the virus in two
important ways. First, Bcl3 may promote cell division and thus clonal
proliferation of the virus. Second, Bcl3 may attenuate virion production,
facilitating immune evasion. One consequence of this regulatory loop may be
Bcl3-induced malignant transformation of the host cell.

The MutS1 protein recognizes unpaired bases and initiates mismatch repair, which 
are essential for high-fidelity DNA replication. The homologous MutS2 protein
does not contribute to mismatch repair, but suppresses homologous recombination. 
MutS2 lacks the damage-recognition domain of MutS1, but contains an additional
C-terminal extension: the small MutS-related (Smr) domain. This domain, which is 
present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, has previously been reported to bind 
to DNA and to possess nicking endonuclease activity. We determine here the
solution structure of the functionally active Smr domain of the Bcl3-binding
protein (also known as Nedd4-binding protein 2), a protein with unknown function 
that lacks other domains present in MutS proteins. The Smr domain adopts a
two-layer alpha-beta sandwich fold, which has a structural similarity to the
C-terminal domain of IF3, the R3H domain, and the N-terminal domain of DNase I.
The most conserved residues are located in three loops that form a contiguous,
exposed, and positively charged surface with distinct sequence identity for
prokaryotic and eukaryotic Smr domains. NMR titration experiments and DNA binding
studies using Bcl3-binding protein-Smr domain mutants suggested that these most
conserved loop regions participate in DNA binding to
single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junctions. Based on the observed
DNA-binding-induced multimerization, the structural similarity with both
subdomains of DNase I, and the experimentally identified DNA-binding surface, we 
propose a model for DNA recognition by the Smr domain.

We have recently demonstrated that nuclear expression of BCL10 predicts
Helicobacter pylori (HP) independence of early-stage gastric diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) with histologic evidence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT). In this study, we examined the role of B cell-activating factor of TNF
family (BAFF) in mediating BCL10 nuclear translocation and HP independence of
gastric DLBCL (MALT). We used immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting to measure 
the expression of BAFF, pAKT, BCL3, BCL10, and NF-kappaB. Transactivity of
NF-kappaB was measured by electromobility shift assay. In lymphoma samples from
26 patients with gastric DLBCL (MALT), we detected aberrant expression of BAFF in
7 of 10 (70%) HP-independent and in 3 of 16 (18.8%) HP-dependent cases (P =
.015). BAFF overexpression was associated with pAKT expression (P = .032), and
nuclear expression of BCL3 (P = .014), BCL10 (P = .015), and NF-kappaB (P =
.004). In B-cell lymphoma Pfeiffer cells, BAFF activated NF-kappaB and AKT; the
activated NF-kappaB up-regulated BCL10, and the activated AKT caused formation of
BCL10/BCL3 complexes that translocated to the nucleus. Inhibition of AKT by
LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) blocked BCL10 nuclear translocation, NF-kappaB
transactivity, and BAFF expression. Our results indicate that autocrine BAFF
signal transduction pathways may contribute to HP-independent growth of gastric
DLBCL (MALT).

A genome-wide screen using 382 STR markers to localize and identify the gene
implicated in early-onset dementia (EOD) without bone cysts in a Lebanese family 
with three affected subjects was conducted. A unique locus homozygous by descent 
at chromosome 6p21.2 locus was identified. Candidate genes were explored by
fluorescent sequencing and the effect of the identified mutation was confirmed by
qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR. The genetic analysis revealed a novel
deletion, c.40+3delAGG, in the 5' consensus donor splice site in intron 1 of
TREM2 gene which is known to be responsible for PLOSL (Polycystic Lipomembranous 
Osteodysplasia with Sclerosing Leukoencephalopathy) also designated as
Nasu-Hakola disease. In silico analysis predicted a lower strength for the novel 
donor splice site. Qualitative RT-PCR revealed normal transcript while
quantitative RT-PCR showed over twofold down-regulation of TREM2 transcripts. The
expression profile of six genes SPP1, NEDD9, FSCN, BCL3, NFKBIA and CCL2 known as
disrupted in TREM2-deficient samples was studied and showed same expression
profile as TREM2-mutated samples except for CCL2 which was normally regulated.
The significantly-reduced expression of TREM2 in our patients and the expression 
profiles of the six studied genes confirm a role for TREM2 in this distinct
phenotype of EOD without bone cysts. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of mutations in TREM2 causing a pure dementia.

Silica surface modification reactions with aluminum and boron alkyls and (alkyl) 
chlorides: reactivities and surface nanostructures.

(1)Department of Chemistry, Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, IL 61920,
USA.

The functionalization of nanoporous and nanoparticulate silica surfaces requires 
a molecular level understanding of the chemistry and structures which result from
surface reactions. Various types of reactive groups on silica can participate,
giving rise to different nanostructures. It is necessary to devise methods to
alter the reactive nature of silica surfaces to control the nanoscale chemical
structure. Various silica pretreatments are utilized to alter the silica surface 
prior to reaction with AlEt3, AlEtxCl(3-x), BEt3, BCl3, and TiCl4. Reactivities
of these surface reactive reagents are compared. Aluminum compounds
preferentially react with loss of alkane rather than HCl, in a thermodynamically 
controlled reaction as determined by ab initio computational methods.
Consideration of the structures resulting from reaction of the boron and aluminum
compounds above with silica surface diols has been taken into account. Particular
attention has been paid to the possibility of forming a cyclic 4-membered ring
structure. While this is unlikely to form from reactions with MCl3, such
structures may be possible when reacting silicas with MMe3.

Synthesis of microporous boron-substituted carbon (b/c) materials using polymeric
precursors for hydrogen physisorption.

Chung TC(1), Jeong Y, Chen Q, Kleinhammes A, Wu Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State
University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.

This paper discusses a new synthesis route to prepare microporous boron
substituted carbon (B/C) materials that show a significantly higher hydrogen
binding energy and physisorption capacity, compared with the corresponding
carbonaceous (C) materials. The chemistry involves a pyrolysis of the designed
boron-containing polymeric precursors, which are the polyaddition and
polycondensation adducts between BCl3 and phenylene diacetylene and lithiated
phenylene diacetylene, respectively. During pyrolysis, most of the boron moieties
were transformed into a B-substituted C structure, and the in situ formed LiCl
byproduct created a microporous structure. The microporous B/C material with B
content > 7% and surface area > 700 m2/g has been prepared, which shows a
reversible hydrogen physisorption capacity of 0.6 and 3.2 wt % at 293 and 77 K,
respectively, under 40 bar of hydrogen pressure. The physisorption results were
further warranted by absorption isotherms indicating a binding energy of hydrogen

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play key
roles in regulating emergency granulopoiesis and inflammation, and are both
negatively regulated by the inducible intracellular protein suppressor of
cytokine signaling-3 (Socs3). Mice with Socs3 deleted specifically in
hematopoietic cells succumb to severe neutrophil and macrophage-driven
inflammation by 1 year of age, and responses to G-CSF are grossly exacerbated. In
order to determine which elements of cellular responses to cytokines require
Socs3, we have examined the differentiative and proliferative capacity of
hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulated by G-CSF and IL-6. The differentiation 
of Socs3-deficient progenitor cells is skewed toward macrophage production in
response to G-CSF or IL-6, whereas wild-type progenitor cells produce mainly
neutrophils. The proliferative capacity of Socs3-deficient progenitor cells is
greatly enhanced in response to G-CSF at all concentrations, but only at low
concentrations for IL-6. Strikingly, synergistic responses to costimulation with 
stem cell factor and IL-6 (but not G-CSF) are lost at higher concentrations in
Socs3-deficient progenitor cells. Cytokine-induced expression of transcriptional 
regulators including cebpb, Ets2, Bcl3, c-Myc, Jun, and Fosl2 are differentially 
regulated in Socs3-deficient cells. The tight regulation by Socs3 of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and gene
transcription after cytokine receptor ligation significantly influences the fate 
of myeloid progenitor cells.

Genetic and biochemical analyses show that IL-23p19 plays a central role in
mediating bacteria-induced colitis in interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice.
The molecular mechanisms responsible for the dysregulated innate host response
leading to enhanced IL-23 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) mice are poorly
understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Bcl3 in controlling
LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
(BMDC) isolated from IL-10(-/-) mice. We report higher IL-23p19 mRNA accumulation
and protein secretion in LPS-stimulated BMDC isolated from IL-10(-/-) compared
with WT mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl3)
expression was strongly impaired (90% decrease) in IL-10(-/-) BMDC compared with 
WT BMDC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced RelA binding to the 
IL-23p19 promoter in IL-10(-/-) compared with WT BMDC. Bcl3 overexpression
decreased LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) BMDC, which
correlated with enhanced NF-kappaB p50 binding and decreased RelA binding to the 
gene promoter. Conversely, Bcl3 knockdown enhanced LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene
expression in WT BMDC. Moreover, LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression was
significantly enhanced in Bcl3(-/-) BMDC compared with WT BMDC. In conclusion,
enhanced LPS-induced IL-23p19 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) mice is due to
impaired Bcl3 expression leading to diminished p50 and enhanced RelA recruitment 
to the IL-23p19 promoter.

The synthesis of a UDP-Galf analog incorporating a
1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-galactitol skeleton alpha-linked to UMP by a 3C-tether
and of a series of related pyrrolidine galactofuranose mimicks is reported. These
compounds were obtained by way of the highly stereoselective reaction of
silylated nucleophiles with a N-Cbz glucofuranosylamine which afforded the
corresponding open-chain product with a 1,2-syn stereochemistry, as predicted
from pionneering studies from Kobayashi. Cyclization of these intermediates
afforded alpha-C-glycosides of imino-galactofuranose carrying various functional 
groups in the aglycone. Further elaboration of the alpha-C-allyl substituted
derivative by cross-metathesis with a uridin-5'-yl vinylphosphonate provided,
after deprotection, the desired original UDP-Galf mimicks. Cleavage of the benzyl
ether protecting groups in the iminosugar component using BCl3 proved critical to
the success of the synthetic plan. Several of the new
1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-galactitol derivatives were evaluated as inhibitors of
UGM (UDP-galactopyranose mutase) from Escherichia coli; however, none of them
exhibited less than mM activities toward this enzyme which catalyzes a crucial
step of the biosynthesis of galactofuranose-containing bacterial cell-surface
glycans.

Comment in
    Transplantation. 2008 Feb 27;85(4):499-500.

BACKGROUND: Delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation (KTx)
ranges between 2% and 50%. The mechanisms leading to DGF deserve special interest
because DGF exerts negative influences on long-term outcomes. We studied gene
expression profiles in deceased donor kidney (DDK) biopsies with and without DGF.
METHODS: Gene expression profiling was performed on donor kidney tissues from 33 
DDK with the use of microarrays. DDK were classified as grafts with immediate
function (non-DGF; n=21) and grafts with DGF (n=12). DGF was defined as a
dialysis requirement in the first week after transplantation. Demographic donor
and recipient information was collected. The robust-multiarray average method was
used to estimate probe set expression summaries. Logistic regression was used to 
identify genes significantly associated with DGF development.
RESULTS: Patients were followed for 3 months after KTx. Thirty-eight probe sets
(n=36 genes) were univariably differentially expressed in DDK with DGF when
compared with DDK with non-DGF (alpha=0.001). Sixty-nine probe sets (n=65 genes) 
were differentially expressed in DDK with DGF when compared with DDK with non-DGF
after adjusting for cold ischemia time (alpha=0.001). Gene ontology terms
classified the overexpressed genes in DDK with DGF as principally related to cell
cycle/growth (e.g., IGFBP5, CSNK2A2), signal transduction (e.g., RASGRP3), immune
response (e.g., CD83, BCL3, MX1), and metabolism (e.g., ENPP4, GBA3). TNFRSF1B
was overexpressed in DDK with DGF.
CONCLUSIONS: Cold ischemia time was a predictor of DGF independently of the
preservation method. We identified a set of 36 genes candidates of DGF in DDK,
with genes involved in the inflammatory response being the more important.

Direct formation of element chlorides from the corresponding element oxides
through microwave-assisted carbohydrochlorination reactions.

Nordschild S(1), Auner N.

Max-von-Laue-Strasse 7, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

A series of technically and economically important element chlorides-such as
SiCl4, BCl3, AlCl3, FeCl2, PCl3 and TiCl4-was synthesized through reactions
between hydrogen chloride and the corresponding element oxides in the presence of
different carbon sources with microwave assistance. This process route was
optimized for demonstration purposes for tetrachlorosilane formation and
successfully demonstrates the broad applicability of various silicon
oxide-containing minerals and materials for carbohydrochlorination. The
chlorination reaction occurs at lower temperatures than with conventional heating
in a tubular oven, with substantially shorter reaction times and in better
yields: quantitatively in the case of tetrachlorosilane, based on the silicon
content of the starting material. The experimental procedure is very simple and
provides basic information about the suitability of element compounds, especially
element oxides, for carbohydrochlorination. According to the general reaction
sequence element oxide-->element-->element chloride used in today's technology,
this one-step carbohydrochlorination with hydrogen chloride is considerably more 
efficient, particularly in terms of energy input and reaction times, avoiding the
isolation of the pure elements required for chlorination to give the element
chlorides with use of the more corrosive and toxic chlorine gas.

A boron trihalide mediated alkyne-aldehyde coupling reaction leading to
stereodefined 1,3,5-triaryl-1,5-dihalo-1,4-pentadienes is described. The study
led to the discovery of a direct substitution of hydroxyl groups by stereodefined
alkenyl moieties using alkenylboron dihalides. During the investigation, it was
also discovered that, at low temperatures, the reaction of BCl3 with alkynes
produces monovinylboron dichloride rather than the reported divinylboron
chloride. A modified reaction mechanism for the boron trichloride mediated
alkyne-aldehyde coupling reaction is now proposed. The reaction temperature and
mode of addition have been found to have dramatic affects on the stereochemistry 
of the diene products.

Mucosal IL-10 and TGF-beta play crucial roles in preventing LPS-driven,

IL-10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine that plays an obligate role in preventing
spontaneous enterocolitis in mice. However, little is known about IL-10 function 
in the human intestinal mucosa. We showed here that IL-10 was constitutively
expressed and secreted by the human normal colonic mucosa, including epithelial
cells. Depletion of IL-10 in mucosal explants induced both downregulation of the 
IL-10-inducible, immunosuppressive gene BCL3 and upregulation of IFN-gamma,
TNF-alpha, and IL-17. Interestingly, TGF-beta blockade also strongly induced
IFN-gamma production. In addition, the high levels of IFN-gamma produced upon
IL-10 depletion were responsible for surface epithelium damage and crypt loss,
mainly by apoptosis. Polymyxin B, used as a scavenger of endogenous LPS,
abolished both IFN-gamma production and epithelial barrier disruption. Finally,
adding a commensal bacteria strain to mucosa explant cultures depleted of both
IL-10 and LPS reproduced the ability of endogenous LPS to induce IFN-gamma
secretion. These findings demonstrate that IL-10 ablation leads to an endogenous 
IFN-gamma-mediated inflammatory response via LPS from commensal bacteria in the
human colonic mucosa. We also found that both IL-10 and TGF-beta play crucial
roles in maintaining human colonic mucosa homeostasis.

2-Position base-modified analogues of adenophostin A as high-affinity agonists of
the D-myo-inositol trisphosphate receptor: in vitro evaluation and molecular
modeling.

Adenophostin A (AdA) is a potent agonist of the d-myo-inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (Ins(1,4,5)P3R). Various 2-aminopurine analogues of 
AdA were synthesized, all of which (guanophostin 5, 2,6-diaminopurinophostin 6,
2-aminopurinophostin 7, and chlorophostin 8) are more potent than
2-methoxy-N6-methyl AdA, the only benchmark of this class. The
2-amino-6-chloropurine nucleoside 11, from Vorbrüggen condensation of
2-amino-6-chloropurine with appropriately protected disaccharide, served as the
advanced common precursor for all the analogues. Alcoholysis provided the
precursor for 5, ammonolysis at high temperature the precursor for 6, and
ammonolysis under mild conditions the precursor for synthesis of 7 and 8. For 8, 
the debenzylation of precursor leaving the chlorine untouched was achieved by
judicious use of BCl3. The reduced potency of chlorophostin 8 and higher potency 
of guanophostin 5 in assays of Ca2+ release via recombinant Ins(1,4,5)P3R are in 
agreement with our model suggesting a cation-pi interaction between AdA and
Ins(1,4,5)P3R. The similar potencies of 2,6-diaminopurinophostin (6) and
2-aminopurinophostin (7) concur with previous reports that the 6-NH2 moiety
contributes negligibly to the potency of AdA. Molecular modeling of the 2-amino
derivatives suggests an interaction between the carboxylate side chain of Glu505 
of the receptor and the 2-NH2 of the ligand, but for 2-methoxy-N6-methyl AdA the 
carboxylate group of Glu505 is deflected away from the methoxy group. A
helix-dipole interaction between the 1-phosphate of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the
2'-phosphate of AdA with alpha-helix 6 of Ins(1,4,5)P3R is postulated. The
results support a proposed model for high-affinity binding of AdA to
Ins(1,4,5)P3R.

reductions of gave mixtures of 4 and diazaborole [(2,6-Pr(i)2C6H3NCH)2BCl] 7.
Pd(0) reduction cleanly gave diazaborole 7. Reduction of 6 gave a low yield of

phenyl groups on the diazadiene C-2 and C-3 atoms hinder the radical coupling
observed in , gave predominantly diazaborole .BCl, (9a) contaminated with .BCl2,

The functional relationship between co-repressor N-CoR and SMRT in mediating
transcriptional repression by thyroid hormone receptor alpha.

A central issue in mediating repression by nuclear hormone receptors is the
distinct or redundant function between co-repressors N-CoR (nuclear receptor
co-repressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone
receptor). To address the functional relationship between SMRT and N-CoR in TR
(thyroid hormone receptor)-mediated repression, we have identified multiple TR
target genes, including BCL3 (B-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein), Spot14 (thyroid
hormone-inducible hepatic protein), FAS (fatty acid synthase), and ADRB2
(beta-adrenergic receptor 2). We demonstrated that siRNA (small interfering RNA) 
treatment against either N-CoR or SMRT is sufficient for the de-repression of
multiple TR target genes. By the combination of sequence mining and physical
association as determined by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays, we
mapped the putative TREs (thyroid hormone response elements) in BCL3, Spot14, FAS
and ADRB2 genes. Our data clearly show that SMRT and N-CoR are independently
recruited to various TR target genes. We also present evidence that
overexpression of N-CoR can restore repression of endogenous genes after knocking
down SMRT. Finally, unliganded, co-repressor-free TR is defective in repression
and interacts with a co-activator, p300. Collectively, these results suggest that
both SMRT and N-CoR are limited in cells and that knocking down either of them
results in co-repressor-free TR and consequently de-repression of TR target
genes.

A convergent total synthesis of (+)-yatakemycin was accomplished by a 20-step
sequence in 13% overall yield. The regioselective ring opening of
(S)-epichlorohydrin with a 2,6-dibromophenyllithium derivative enabled us to
introduce a chiral carbon center, which was required for the stereoselective
construction of the cyclopropane ring. The five aryl-nitrogen bonds in
(+)-yatakemycin were constructed by a mild copper-mediated aryl amination that
utilized the combination of CuI with CsOAc. The efficient and chemoselective
debenzylation of aryl benzyl ether with BCl3 in the presence of
pentamethylbenzene was developed. With these new methodologies, the subgram-scale
synthesis of (+)-yatakemycin was achieved.

Natural phosphorylation of CD5 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells and
analysis of CD5-regulated genes in a B cell line suggest a role for CD5 in
malignant phenotype.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results in the accumulation of B cells,
presumably reflecting the selection of malignant cell precursors with Ag combined
with complex alterations in protein activity. Repeated BCR stimulation of normal 
B cells leads to anergy and CD5 expression, both of which are features of CLL.
Because CD5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine following BCR engagement and negatively
regulates BCR signaling in normal B cells, we investigated its phosphorylation
status and found it to be naturally phosphorylated on tyrosine but not on serine 
residues in CLL samples. To analyze the role of CD5, we established a B cell line
in which CD5 is phosphorylated. Gene profiling of vector vs CD5-transfected B
cells pointed out gene groups whose expression was enhanced: Apoptosis inhibitors
(BCL2), NF-kappaB (RELB, BCL3), Wnt, TGFbeta, VEGF, MAPKs, Stats, cytokines,
chemokines (IL-10, IL-10R, IL-2R, CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCR7), TLR-9, and the surface
Ags CD52, CD54, CD70, and CD72. Most of these gene groups are strongly expressed 
in CLL B cells as compared with normal B cells. Unexpectedly, metabolic pathways,
namely cholesterol synthesis and adipogenesis, are also enhanced by CD5.
Conversely, CD5 inhibited genes involved in RNA splicing and processing, ribosome
biogenesis, proteasome, and CD80 and CD86 Ags, whose expression is low in CLL.
Comparison of CD5- vs tailless CD5-transfected cells further demonstrated the
role of CD5 phosphorylation in the regulation of selected genes. These results
support a model where CLL cells are chronically stimulated, leading to CD5
activation and cell survival. In addition to CD5 itself, we point to several
CD5-induced genes as potential therapeutic targets.

Very few recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in T-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These involve the TRA@/TRD@ gene at chromosome band 14q11 
in up to 15% of cases. We recently reported a novel and recurrent translocation, 
t(14;19)(q11;q13), in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis performed in three cases suggested an involvement of the
TRA@/TRD@ locus at 14q11 and of a region telomeric to BCL3 on 19q13. We now
report the molecular cloning of these translocations. Sequence analysis confirmed
the involvement of the TRA@/TRD@ and indicated that the breakpoints were located 
mainly in the TRAJ region. On chromosome 19, our results revealed a new
clustering of breakpoints outside the region involved in
t(14;19)(q32;q13)-positive B-cell malignancies. Remarkably, all three breaks were
located downstream or within the PVRL2 gene, in a small 10.3 kb interval,
suggesting a nonrandom location of the breakpoints. For two patients, a high mRNA
expression of both PVRL2 and BCL3 was found. In conclusion, we identified PVRL2
as a new recurrent partner gene of the TRA@ locus in PTCL. These results suggest 
that both BCL3 and PVRL2 may participate in the pathogenesis of these PTCLs, but 
further studies should be undertaken to investigate the precise role of these
genes.

BCL3 acts as a negative regulator of transcription from the human T-cell leukemia
virus type 1 long terminal repeat through interactions with TORC3.

By associating with cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), the
human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein activates transcription
from the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), which contains multiple cyclic
AMP-responsive elements. The transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs) were 
a recently identified family of CREB co-activators that bind to CREB to enhance
CRE-mediated transcription. TORC3, a TORC family protein, dramatically enhances
Tax-mediated transcription from the LTR. In this study, we performed a yeast
two-hybrid screen using the N-terminal region of TORC3 as bait and identified
B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia protein 3 (BCL3) as a protein interacting with 
TORC3. This interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown
assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments with detection by Western blotting.
The ankyrin repeat domain of BCL3 interacted with TORC3. By using a luciferase
assay, we determined that BCL3 inhibited transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR in a
manner dependent on TORC3. Knockdown of endogenous BCL3 using RNA interference
enhanced transcriptional activation of CRE. Treatment with trichostatin A, a
potent inhibitor of the transcriptional co-repressor HDAC, partially reversed the
inhibitory effect of BCL3. These results suggest that BCL3 functions as a
repressor of HTLV-1 LTR-mediated transcription through interactions with TORC3.
In addition to stimulating transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR, Tax also enhances
BCL3 expression; thus, transcription from the LTR is regulated by both positive
and negative feedback mechanisms.

Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an alternative to
conventional chromosome analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We 
analyzed 172 samples from 136 possible CLL cases using a FISH panel. Reflex
testing with probes to CCND1, BCL2, BCL3, BCL11A, c-MYC, MALT1, and a break-apart
immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) probe was done if more than 2 signals for 14q32 
occurred. For 111 cases, there were sufficient data for analysis. Of 111 cases,
81 (72.9%) had 1 or more genetic abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality was
13q-, followed by trisomy 12, 11q-, and 17p-. In 13 cases, there were IGH
abnormalities. Two cases with CCND1/IGH fusion were reclassified as mantle cell
lymphoma. Four CLL cases had IGH fusion with BCL2, BCL3 (2 cases), and BCL11A; no
fusion partner was detected in 7 cases. Morphologic features were atypical for
CLL in 2 cases with IGH fusion (BCL11A and BCL3). The FISH CLL panel is useful to
identify prognostic aberrations and to clarify diagnosis in cases with unusual
morphologic features.

The pathogenesis of mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-NHLs) is poorly
understood. Analogous to B-cell lymphomas, in which the immunoglobulin (IgH)
receptor loci are frequently targeted by chromosomal translocations, the T-cell
receptor (TCR) gene loci are affected by translocations in a subset of precursor 
T-cell malignancies. In a large-scale analysis of 245 paraffin-embedded mature
T-NHLs, arranged in a tissue microarray format and using improved FISH assays for
the detection of breakpoints in the TCRalpha/delta, TCRbeta, and TCRgamma loci,
we provide evidence that mature T-NHLs other than T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia
(T-PLL) also occasionally show a chromosomal rearrangement that involves the
TCRalpha/delta locus. In particular, one peripheral T-cell lymphoma (not
otherwise specified, NOS) with the morphological variant of Lennert lymphoma
displayed a chromosomal translocation t(14;19) involving the TCRalpha/delta and
the BCL3 loci. A second case, an angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILT),
carried an inv(14)(q11q32) affecting the TCRalpha/delta and IgH loci. FISH signal
constellations as well as concomitant comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
data were also suggestive of the occurrence of an isochromosome 7, previously
described to be pathognomonic for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, in rare cases
of enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma.

Alteration of NF-kappaB activity leads to mitochondrial apoptosis after infection
with pathological prion protein.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a key regulator of the immune response, but
in almost the same manner it is involved in induction of inflammation,
proliferation and regulation of apoptosis. In the central nervous system
activated NF-kappaB plays a neuroprotective role. While in some neurodegenerative
disorders the role of NF-kappaB is well characterized, there is poor knowledge on
the role of NF-kappaB in prion disease. We found binding but no transcriptional
activity of the transcription factor in vitro. Characterizing the mechanism of
cell death after infection with pathological prion protein increased caspase-9
and caspase-3 activity was detected and the lack of NF-kappaB activity resulted
in the inability to activate target genes that usually play an important role in 
neuroprotection. Additionally, we investigated the role of NF-kappaB after prion 
infection of Nfkb1(-/-), Nfkb2(-/-) and Bcl3(-/-) mice and central nervous
system-specific p65-deleted mice revealing an accelerated prion disease in
NF-kappaB2- and Bcl-3-deficient mice, which is in line with a reduced
neuroprotective activity in prion infection. Based on our findings, we propose a 
model whereby the alteration of NF-kappaB activity at the early stages of
infection with pathological prion protein leads to neuronal cell death mediated
by mitochondrial apoptosis.

ClnH6-nSiGe compounds for CMOS compatible semiconductor applications: synthesis
and fundamental studies.

We describe the synthesis of a new family of chlorinated Si-Ge hydrides based on 
the formula ClnH6-nSiGe. Selectively controlled chlorination of H3SiGeH3 is
provided by reactions with BCl3 to produce ClH2SiGeH3 (1) and Cl2HSiGeH3 (2).
This represents a viable single-step route to the target compounds in commercial 
yields for semiconductor applications. The built-in Cl functionalities are
specifically designed to facilitate selective growth compatible with CMOS
processing. Higher order polychlorinated derivatives such as Cl2SiHGeH2Cl (3),
Cl2SiHGeHCl2 (4), ClSiH2GeH2Cl (5), and ClSiH2GeHCl2 (6) have also been produced 
for the first time leading to a new class of highly reactive Si-Ge compounds that
are of fundamental and practical interest. Compounds 1-6 are characterized by
physical and spectroscopic methods including NMR, FTIR, and mass spectroscopy.
The results combined with first principles density functional theory are used to 
elucidate the structural, thermochemical, and vibrational trends throughout the
general sequence of ClnH6-nSiGe and provide insight into the dependence of the
reaction kinetics on Cl content in the products. The formation of 1 was also
demonstrated by an alternative route based on the reaction of (SO3CF3)SiH2GeH3
and CsCl. Depositions of 1 and 2 at very low temperatures (380-450 degrees C)
produce near stoichiometric SiGe films on Si exhibiting monocrystalline
microstructures, smooth and continuous surface morphologies, reduced defect
densities, and unusual strain properties.

The biologic and pathologic features of B-cell malignancies bearing a
translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13) leading to a fusion of IGH and BCL3 are still
poorly described. Herein we report the results of a comprehensive cytogenetic,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular and histopathological survey
of a large series of B-cell malignancies with t(14;19) or variant translocations.
A total of 56 B-cell malignancies with a FISH-proven BCL3 involvement were
identified with the translocation partners being IGH (n=51), IGL (n=2), IGK (n=2)
and a non-IG locus (n=1). Hierarchical clustering of chromosomal changes
associated with the t(14;19) indicated the presence of two different groups of
IG/BCL3-positive lymphatic neoplasias. The first group included 26 B-cell
malignancies of various histologic subtypes containing a relatively high number
of chromosomal changes and mostly mutated IgVH genes. This cluster displayed
three cytogenetic branches, one with rearrangements in 7q, another with deletions
in 17p and a third one with rearrangements in 1q and deletions in 6q and 13q. The
second group included 19 cases, mostly diagnosed as B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (B-CLL), and characterized by few additional chromosomal changes (e.g.
trisomy 12) and unmutated IgVH genes. In conclusion, our study indicates that
BCL3 translocations are not restricted to B-CLL but present in a heterogeneous
group of B-cell malignancies.

DP58, an inducible myeloid protein, is constitutively expressed in murine
neuronal nuclei.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Life Sciences, Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN 47809,

A novel cytosolic phosphoprotein, DP58 induced in bone marrow-derived dendritic
progenitors was found in this study to be constitutively expressed at a very high
level in neuronal nuclei. Amplified cDNA confirmed by sequencing to be DP58 was
present only in brain tissue, and DP58-like protein was expressed in neurons as a
52 kDa nuclear protein, phosphorylated primarily at the serine residues. In
contrast, its isoform in dendritic progenitors appeared as a 58 kDa inducible
protein with phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. Although
protein markers common to brain and hematopoietic cells are known, no report was 
found on constitutive expression in neuronal nuclei of DP58, an inducible
Pro-myloid marker. The sequence of DP58 reveals ankyrin repeats present in a wide
spectrum of interacting proteins including NF-kappaB-binding BCL3, a
predominantly nuclear protein of I-kappaB family. The contrasting phosphorylated 
forms of DP58 suggest a distinct physiological role in neuronal cells and early
dendritic progenitors.

This study investigates the adsorption and reactions of boron trichloride and its
fragments (BClx) on the TiO2 anatase (101) and rutile (110) surfaces by
first-principles calculations. The results show that the possible absorbates on
the TiO2 anatase and rutile surfaces are very similar. The single- and
double-site adsorption configurations are found for both anatase and rutile
surfaces. The particular adsorbate feature on the anatase surface is its in-plane
double-site adsorption by Ti and O from its sawtooth surface. The potential
energy surface shows that BCl3 can be adsorbed on the O site for both the
anantase and rutile surfaces and the most of the BClx reaction on both anatase
and rutile surfaces are endothermic, except for the dissociative reaction on the 
rutile surface. The energy levels of the BClx reactions between the anatase and
rutile surfaces show that the rutile surface has lower energy levels than those
of anatase surface. This result reveals that the BClx dissociative adsorption
more easily occurs on rutile surface than on anatase surface.

Boron and aluminum complexes of sterically demanding phosphinimines and
phosphinimides.

Reactions of sterically demanding phosphinimines R3PNH [R=i-Pr (1), t-Bu (2)]
were examined. Reactions with B(C6F5)3 formed the adducts (R3PNH)B(C6F5)3 [R=i-Pr
(3), t-Bu (4)] in high yield. On the other hand, 2 reacts with HB(OBu)2, evolving
H2 to give t-Bu3PNB(OBu)2 (5). The reaction of 2 equiv of 2 with BH3.SMe2 affords
the species (t-Bu3PN)2BH (6). In contrast, the reaction of n-Bu(t-Bu)2PNH with
BH3.SMe2 results in the formation of the robust adduct n-Bu(t-Bu)2PNH.BH3 (8). An
alternative route to borane-phosphinimide complexes involves Me3SiCl elimination,
as exemplified by the reaction of BCl2Ph with n-Bu3PNSiMe3, which gives the
product n-Bu3PNBCl(Ph) (9). The corresponding reactions of the parent
phosphinimines 1 and 2 with AlH3.NMe2Et give the dimers [(mu-i-Pr3PN)AlH2]2 (10) 
and [(mu-t-Bu3PN)AlH2]2 (11). Species 11 reacts further with Me3SiO3SCF3 to
provide [(mu-t-Bu3PN)AlH(OSO2CF3)]2 (12). The reaction of the lithium salt
[t-Bu3PNLi]4 (13) with BCl3 proceeds smoothly to give t-Bu3PNBCl2 (14), which is 
readily alkylated to give t-Bu3PNBMe2 (15). Subsequent reaction of 15 with
B(C6F5)3 results in methyl abstraction and the formation of
[(mu-t-Bu3PN)BMe]2[MeB(C6F5)3]2 (16). The reaction of 13 in a 2:1 ratio with BCl3
gives the salt [(t-Bu3PN)2B]Cl (17). This species can be methylated to give
(t-Bu3PN)2BMe (18), which undergoes subsequent reaction with [Ph3C][X]
(X=[B(C6F5)4], [PF6]) to form the related salts [(t-Bu3PN)2B][B(C6F5)4] (19) and 
[(t-Bu3PN)2B][PF6] (20), respectively. Analogous reactions with [Ph3C][BF4]
afforded [t-Bu3PNBF2]2 (21). Compounds 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 17, 19, and 21 were
characterized by X-ray crystallography.

A general method developed for the parallel solid-phase synthesis of sn-1,2- and 
sn-2,3-diacyglycerol derivatives. The technique relies on the use of carboxylic
acid-promoted epoxide ring-opening reactions of the glycidyl-bound resin 3. The
polymer-bound monoacylglycerol 5, formed in this manner, is transformed to the
respective polymer-bound diacylglycerols 7 and 9 by reaction of the free alcohol 
moiety with a second carboxylic acid under conditions that lead to retention or
inversion of C-2 stereochemistry. The sequence is completed by BCl3-promoted
cleavage of 7 and 9 to form the sn-1,2- and sn-2,3-diacylglycerols, respectively.

Tripodal amido boron and aluminum complexes.

80523-1872, USA.

The synthesis and structural elucidations of novel boron and aluminum complexes
incorporating the tripodal triamido [N3]3- ligand framework that is hypothesized 
to promote the preorganized pyramidal geometry for high Lewis acidity are
reported. Salt metathesis between the in situ-generated trianionic lithium
complexes of the tripodal amido ligands with BCl3 leads to boranes
HC[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3B (1) and MeSi[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3B (2); however,
substitution of the N-Ar group with the bulky tBu affords the unexpected
non-boron-containing LiCl adduct {[HC(SiMe2NtBu)2(SiMeNtBu)]Li3(Et2O)Cl}2 (3) via
apparent elimination of MeBCl2. The products derived from the salt metathesis
reaction with AlCl3 are determined by the reaction medium: while the reaction in 
a hexanes-ether mixture or toluene affords solvated salt adduct
HC[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3Al.ClLi(Et2O)2 (4) or salt adduct
HC[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3Al.ClLi (5), respectively; the addition of a small amount of
THF produces a mixture of complexes HC[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3Al.(THF) (6, major) and 
HC[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3Al(OCH=CH2).Li(THF)2 (7, minor). The desired complex 6 can
be exclusively formed using HC[SiMe2N(4-MeC6H4)]3Li3.(THF)3 and the hexanes-ether
mixture solvent. The molecular structures of complexes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 have
been elucidated by X-ray diffraction studies. The structure of 1 shows an
approximately trigonal pyramidal geometry at B with no significant N-B p-p
pi-interactions. The strong salt adduct and solvate formation of the tripodal
amido Al complex, as well as its similarity to the strong Lewis acid Al(C6F5)3 in
the THF adduct and enolaluminate formation and structure, indicate the desired
core structure [N3]Al is indeed highly Lewis acidic.

Mechanism of metal chloride-promoted Mukaiyama aldol reactions.

Singapore 117543, Singapore.

Ab initio calculations (MP2/6-311+G**//B3LYP/6-31G*) were employed to investigate
the mechanism of metal chloride-promoted Mukaiyama aldol reaction between
trihydrosilyl enol ether and formaldehyde. The metal chlorides considered include
TiCl4, BCl3, AlCl3, and GaCl3. In contrast to the concerted pathway of the
uncatalyzed aldol reaction, the Lewis acid-promoted reactions favor a stepwise
mechanism. Three possible stepwise pathways were located. The lowest energy
pathway corresponds to a simultaneous C-C bond formation and a chlorine atom
shift in the first (rate-determining) step. This process is calculated to have a 
low activation barrier of 12 kJ mol-1 for the TiCl4-promoted reaction. The
alternative [2+2] cycloaddition and direct carbon-carbon bond formation pathways 
are energetically competitive. BCl3, AlCl3, and GaCl3 are predicted to be
efficient catalysts for the silicon-directed aldol reaction as they strongly
activate the formaldehyde electrophile. Formation of a stable pretransition state
intermolecular pi-pi complex between enol silane and the activated formaldehyde
(CH2=O...MCln) is a key driving force for the facile metal chloride-promoted
reactions.

Few associations of candidate genes with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts in the

University, Vilnius, Lithuania.

Nonsyndromic orofacial clefting (NS-OFC) is a common complex multifactorial trait
with a considerable genetic component and a number of candidate genes suggested
by various approaches. Twenty biallelic and microsatellite DNA markers in the
strong candidate loci TGFA, TGFB3, GABRB3, RARA, and BCL3 were analysed for
allelic association with the NS-OFC phenotype in 112 nuclear families (proband + 
both parents) from Lithuania by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT).
Associations were found between the TGFA gene marker rs2166975 and nonsyndromic
cleft palate only (CPO) phenotype (p = 0.045, df 1) as well as between the D2S292
marker and the cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/CP) phenotype in
allele-wise TDT (P = 0.005, df 9) and genotype-wise TDT (P = 0.021, df 24). A
weak association (P = 0.085, df 3) of the BCL3 marker (BCL3 gene) with the risk
of CPO was also found. Thus our initial results support the contribution of
allelic variation in the TGFA locus to the aetiology of CL/CP in the population
of Lithuania but they do not point to TGFA as a major causal gene. Different
roles of the TGFA and BCL3 genes in the susceptibility to NS-OFC phenotypes are
suggested.

Eosinophil activation during allergic diseases has a detrimental role in the
generation of pathophysiologic responses. Stem cell factor (SCF) has recently
shown an inflammatory, gene-activating role on eosinophils and contributes to the
generation of pathophysiologic changes in the airways during allergic responses. 
The data in the present study outline the signal transduction events that are
induced by SCF in eosinophils and further demonstrate that MEK-mediated signaling
pathways are crucial for SCF-induced CCL6 chemokine activation and eosinophil
survival. SCF-mediated eosinophil activation was demonstrated to include PI-3K
activation as well as MEK/MAPK phosphorylation pathways. Subsequent analysis of
CCL6 gene activation and production induced by SCF in the presence or absence of 
rather specific inhibitors for certain pathways demonstrated that the MEK/MAPK
pathway but not the PI-3K pathway was crucial for the SCF-induced CCL6 gene
activation. These same signaling pathways were shown to initiate antiapoptotic
events and promote eosinophil survival, including up-regulation of BCL2 and BCL3.
Altogether, SCF appears to be a potent eosinophil activation and survival factor.

Author information: 
(1)University of Bristol, School of Chemistry, Bristol, UK BS8 1TS.

The reaction between [Pt(nbe)3] (nbe=norbornene), two equivalents of the
phosphines PPh3, PMePh2 or PMe2Ph and 1 equivalent of BCl3 affords the platinum
dichloroboryl species [PtCl(BCl2)(PPh3)2], [PtCl(BCl2)(PMePh2)2] and
[PtCl(BCl2)(PMe2Ph)2]. All three complexes were characterised by X-ray
crystallography and reveal that the boryl group lies trans to the chloride. With 
PMe3 as the phosphine, the complex [PtCl(BCl2)(PMe3)2] is isolated in high yield 
as a white crystalline powder although crystals suitable for X-ray
crystallography were not obtained. Crystals were obtained of a product shown by
X-ray crystallography to be the unusual dinuclear species
[Pt2(BCl2)2(PMe3)4(micro-Cl)][BCl4] which reveals an arrangement in which two
square planar platinum(II) centres are linked by a single bridging chloride which
is trans to a BCl2 group on each platinum centre. The reaction of
[PtCl(BCl2)(PMe3)2] with NEt3 or pyridine (py) affords the adducts
[PtCl{BCl2(NEt3)}(PMe3)2] and [PtCl{BCl2(py)}(PMe3)2], respectively, both
characterised spectroscopically. The reaction between [PtCl(BCl2)(PMe3)2] and
either 4 equivalents of NHEt2 or piperidine (pipH) results in the
mono-substituted boryl species [PtCl{BCl(NEt2)}(PMe3)2] and
[PtCl{BCl(pip)}(PMe3)2], respectively, the former characterised by X-ray
crystallography. Treatment of either [PtCl(BCl2)(PMe3)2] (in the presence of
excess NEt3) or [PtCl{BCl(NEt2)}(PMe3)2] with catechol affords the B(cat)
(cat=catecholate) derivative [PtCl{B(cat)}(PMe3)2] which is also formed in the
reaction between [Pt(PMe3)4] and ClB(cat) and also from the slow decomposition of
[Pt{B(cat)}2(PMe3)2] in dichloromethane over a period of months. The compound
[Pt{B(cat)}2(PMe3)2] was prepared from the reaction between [Pt(PMe3)4] and
B2(cat)2.

The t(14;19)(q32;q13), involving the BCL3 locus at chromosome 19q13 and the
immunoglobulin heavy chain gene at 14q32, is a rare recurrent cytogenetic
abnormality identified in B-cell neoplasms, most of which have been classified as
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the literature. We describe the
clinicopathological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic findings in seven patients 
with B-cell neoplasms associated with t(14;19)(q32;q13). There were five men and 
two women, with a median age of 48 years (range 33-68). All had absolute
lymphocytosis, six had lymphadenopathy, and one had splenomegaly. Lymphocytes in 
blood and bone marrow aspirate smears were predominantly small and cytologically 
atypical. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed an atypical immunophenotype
with low CLL scores. The growth pattern in bone marrow biopsy specimens was
interstitial to diffuse; immunohistochemical stains were positive for bcl3 and
negative for cyclin D1. Lymph node biopsy specimens of two patients revealed
total architectural effacement by neoplasm with proliferation centres. In
addition to t(14;19), cytogenetic studies demonstrated trisomy 12 in five
patients. These results suggest that B-cell neoplasms with the t(14;19)(q32;q13) 
present frequently as leukaemia composed of small B-lymphocytes and share many
features with CLL. However, these neoplasms also differ from CLL cytologically
and in their immunophenotype.

Immunological adjuvants activate innate immune cells for Ag presentation and
elicitation of cytokines like IL-12 that promote T cell expansion and effector
differentiation. An important but elusive aim for most immunization strategies is
to produce memory T cells that provide durable immunity. Recent evidence
demonstrates that the context of Ag presentation instructionally programs T cells
for short- and long-term responses. However, the role and mechanisms by which
cytokines like IL-12 condition CD8 T cells for long-term responses remain
relatively uncharacterized. In this study, we show that brief exposure (20 h) of 
naive TCR-transgenic CD8 cells to IL-12 during Ag stimulation leads to transient 
phosphorylation of STAT4 for robust effector differentiation. Moreover, the
IL-12-induced STAT4 engenders greater clonal expansion of the Ag-activated CD8
cells by regulating the expression of the transcriptional factor Bcl3- and
Bcl2-related genes that promote survival of Ag-activated CD8 cells. Remarkably,
the IL-12-conditioned CD8 T cells demonstrate increased sensitivity to IL-7 and
IL-15, whereby they are rendered "fit" for homeostatic self-renewal as well as
augmented CD4-dependent recall responses that are effective at controlling
Salmonella infection in vivo. This information provides new insights into
mechanisms by which IL-12 conditions CD8 T cells for long-term immunity, which is
likely to benefit development of new strategies for the use of IL-12 in
infectious diseases and cancer.

Chromosomal breakpoints affecting immunoglobulin (IG) loci are recurrent in many 
subtypes of B-cell lymphomas. However, despite the predominant B-cell origin of
the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL),
the presence of chromosomal translocations in IG loci has not yet been
systematically explored. Therefore, we have investigated a series of cHL for
chromosomal breakpoints in the IGH (n = 230), IGL (n = 139), and IGK (n = 138)
loci by interphase cytogenetics. Breakpoints in the IGH, IGL, or IGK locus were
observed in the HRS cells of 26 of 149 (17%), 2 of 70, and 1 of 77 evaluable
cHLs, respectively. The IG partners could be identified in eight cHLs and
involved chromosomal bands 2p16 (REL), 3q27 (BCL6, two cases), 8q24.1 (MYC),
14q24.3, 16p13.1, 17q12, and 19q13.2 (BCL3/RELB). In 65 of 85 (76%) cHLs
evaluable for an IGH triple-color probe, the HRS cells showed evidence for a
(partial) deletion of the IGH constant region, suggesting the presence of class
switch recombination (CSR). Furthermore, analyses with this probe in cases with
IGH breakpoints indicated that at least part of them seem to be derived from CSR 
defects. Our results show that chromosomal breakpoints affecting the IG loci are 
recurrent in cHL.

Effect of all-trans retinoic acid on sodium/iodide symporter expression,
radioiodine uptake and gene expression profiles in a human anaplastic thyroid
carcinoma cell line.

The plasma membrane glycoprotein sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is crucial for
thyroid hormone biosynthesis and mediates the iodide uptake of thyrocytes. It has
been shown that retinoic acid (RA) alters NIS gene expression in thyroid
carcinoma lines and stimulates their iodide uptake. Here, we generated an ARO
human thyroidal cancer cell line that expresses the NIS gene (ARO-NIS) and found 
that its baseline 125I uptake was threefold higher than that of its parental ARO 
cells. However, a 1-microM all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) treatment significantly 
increased this 125I uptake up to approximately approximately 6.5-fold on Day 3.
tRA also elevated NIS mRNA expression in ARO-NIS cells, with peaks of expression 
being observed on Day 3. To investigate the underlying genomic mechanisms
involved in these tRA-induced phenotypic changes, we subjected tRA-treated and
untreated ARO-NIS cells to cDNA microarray analysis. Of 1152, genes spotted onto 
the microarray membrane, 18 were up-regulated (z ratio>2.0) and 33 were
down-regulated (z ratio<-2.0) in ARO-NIS cells after 3 days of tRA treatment.
More specifically, tRA increased the expression of BCL3, CSRP3, v-fos, and CDK5
genes and decreased the expression of the FGF12 and IGFBP6 genes. Thus, tRA
treatment of human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells stably expressing the NIS
gene significantly elevates their NIS-mediated radioiodine uptake and alters the 
expression of many genes involved in cell growth and cellular differentiation.
Therefore, tRA treatment and NIS gene transfection are potential tools for the
diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer.

NFkappaB1/p50 is not required for tumor necrosis factor-stimulated growth of
primary mammary epithelial cells: implications for NFkappaB2/p52 and RelB.

Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.

Nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) plays an important role in mammary gland
development and breast cancer. We previously demonstrated that TNF stimulates
growth of mammary epithelial cells (MEC) in a physiologically relevant
three-dimensional primary culture system, accompanied by enhanced DNA-binding of 
the NFkappaB p50 homodimer. To further understand the mechanism of TNF-stimulated
growth of primary MEC, the requirement for NFkappaB1/p50, and the role of cyclin 
D1 in TNF-stimulated growth were examined. TNF induced the formation of
DNA-binding complexes of p50 and p52 with their coactivator bcl3 in MEC nuclear
extracts. Concomitantly, TNF increased the binding of NFkappaB proteins to the
kappaB site on the cyclin D1 promoter, and increased expression of cyclin D1 mRNA
and protein. Using MEC from p50 null mice, we found that p50 was not required for
TNF-induced growth nor for up-regulation of cyclin D1. However, TNF induced a
p52/RelB NFkappaB DNA-binding complex in p50 null MEC nuclear extracts. In
addition, we found that in wild-type MEC, TNF stimulated the occupancy of p52 and
RelB on the cyclin D1 promoter kappaB site, whereas p50 was present
constitutively. These data suggest that in wild-type MEC, TNF stimulates the
interaction of bcl3 with p50 and p52, and the binding of p52, as well as RelB, to
cyclin D1 promoter kappaB sites, and as a consequence, stimulates the growth of
MEC. In the absence of p50, p52 and RelB can compensate for p50 in TNF-stimulated
growth and cyclin D1 induction in MEC.

Up-regulation of cyclin D1 by HBx is mediated by NF-kappaB2/BCL3 complex through 
kappaB site of cyclin D1 promoter.

Park SG(1), Chung C, Kang H, Kim JY, Jung G.

University, Seoul 151-742, Korea.

Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
exhibiting increased malignant phenotypes. It has also been known that the
hepatitis Bx (HBx) protein is strongly associated with HCC development and
progression. Although overexpression of both proteins is related to HCC, the
relationship between the two has not been well studied. Here we show that HBx
up-regulates cyclin D1 and that this process is mediated by the
NF-kappaB2(p52)/BCL-3 complex. Our experiments indicate that HBx up-regulates
BCL-3 in the mRNA level, which subsequently results in the up-regulation of the
NF-kappaB2(p52)/BCL-3 complex in the nucleus. Moreover, impaired HBx-mediated
BCL-3 up-regulation by small interfering RNA for BCL-3 reduced HBx-mediated
cyclin D1 up-regulation. Down-regulation of the HBx protein level by p53 also
reduced HBx-mediated cyclin D1 up-regulation. From these results, we conclude
that the up-regulation of cyclin D1 by HBx is mediated by the up-regulation of
NF-kappaB2(p52)/BCL-3 in the nucleus. This HBx-mediated-cyclin D1 up-regulation
might play an important role in the HBx-mediated HCC development and progression.

BCL3 is a proto-oncogene affected by chromosomal translocations in some patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is an IkappaB family protein that is
involved in transcriptional regulation of a number of NF-kappaB target genes. In 
this study, interleukin (IL)-6-induced BCL3 expression and its effect on survival
of multiple myeloma (MM) cells were examined. We demonstrate the upregulation of 
BCL3 by IL-6 in INA-6 and other MM cell lines. Sequence analysis of the BCL3 gene
locus revealed four potential signal transducer and activator of transcription
(Stat) binding sites within two conserved intronic enhancers regions: one located
within enhancer HS3 and three within HS4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments showed increased Stat3 binding to both enhancers upon IL-6
stimulation. Silencing Stat3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
abrogated BCL3 expression by IL-6. Using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate
that BCL3 transcription depends on HS4. Mutation of the Stat motifs within HS4
abolished IL-6-dependent BCL3 induction. Furthermore, BCL3 transcription was
inhibited by its own gene product. This repressive feedback is mediated by
NF-kappaB sites within the promoter and HS3. Finally, we show that overexpression
of BCL3 increases apoptosis, whereas BCL3-specific siRNA does not affect the
viability of INA-6 cells suggesting that BCL3 is not essential for the survival
of these cells.

An ab initio study of the electronic structure of BCl3(2+) and its decomposition 
pathways.

Laboratories, 20 Gordon Street, London, UKWC1H 0AJ.

Ab initio methods have been used to characterise the lowest energy potential
energy surfaces of 1BCl3(2+) and 3BCl3(2+). The methods used are MP2, CCSD,
CCSD(T) and MCSCF with 6-311G(d), cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. While the
singlet surface is relatively straight-forward, the triplet surface is very
complicated, with many stationary points in close energetic proximity. The
singlet surface can fragment to the following products (1BCl + 1Cl+ + 1Cl+),
(1Cl+ + 1B+ + 1Cl2), (2BCl+ + 2Cl), while the triplet surface can fragment to
(1BCl2+ + 3Cl+) and (2BCl2(2+) + 2Cl). 2BCl2(2+) can further fragment to (1Cl+ + 
2BCl+). These results are in good agreement with previous experimental data from 
coincidence mass spectroscopy. [symbol: see text]1 diagnostic values have been
calculated for all of the stationary points of BCl3(2+), using the method of Lee 
and Taylor. These data, together with CCSD/CCSD(T) energy differences and MCSCF
calculations, are used to conclude that most of the stationary points on the
singlet surface are well represented using single reference methods. The
stationary points of the triplet system have [symbol: see text]1 diagnostic
values greater than those for the singlet system, as expected when using the
closed-shell [symbol: see text]1 diagnostic method of Lee and Taylor. However,
all of the structures have acceptable single reference wavefunctions if the
open-shell upper limit of Rienstra-Kiracofe et al. (0.045) is used, a conclusion 
fully supported by CCSD/CCSD(T) energy differences. CCSD(T) energies determined
for the fragmentation asymptotes have been compared with experimental data
collated from the NIST Theoretical and Scientific Data website, and the generally
very good agreement between theory and experiment reinforces the reliability of
the CCSD(T) method.

Reappraisal of BCL3 as a molecular marker of anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

The BCL3 gene was initially discovered through its involvement in a recurring
translocation, t(14;19)(q32;q13), which is found in some patients with B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The translocation leads to the
juxtaposition of BCL3 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus, resulting in 
high-level expression of the BCL3 transcript. The Bcl-3 protein includes 7 tandem
copies of the ankyrin repeat element in the central domain, a structure that is
characteristic of the IkappaB family of inhibitors of the nuclear factor kappaB
transcription factors. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a subtype of
aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is characterized by expression of CD30 and
the NPM/ALK chimeric protein, which is generated by t(2;5)(p23;q35). We compared 
the gene expression profiles of ALCL with those of another CD30+ neoplasm,
Hodgkin's disease (HD), and found that BCL3 is expressed at higher levels in ALCL
than in HD. A comparison by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay revealed
that t(2;5)+ ALCL expresses a high level of BCL3 messenger RNA relative to the
levels expressed in other hematologic tumors, and the level in ALCL is comparable
to or even higher than that in t(14;19)+ B-CLL. An immunohistochemical analysis
of ALCL tumor tissues showed that the lymphoma cells exhibited strong nuclear
staining by a monoclonal antibody against Bcl-3. We suggest that Bcl-3
sequestrates the (p50)2 homodimer to the nucleus and that the kappaB sites are
occupied by the (p50)2/Bcl-3 ternary complex. Future studies should identify the 
relationships among the 3 independent molecules (ie, NPM/ALK, CD30, and Bcl-3)
that are activated in t(2;5)+ ALCL.

Syn- and anti-selective Prins cyclizations of delta,epsilon-unsaturated ketones
to 1,3-halohydrins with Lewis acids.

Ten acyclic and monocyclic delta,epsilon-unsaturated ketones, with and without
methyl substituents on the double bond, underwent halide-terminated Prins
(halo-Prins) cyclizations under anhydrous conditions in the presence of Lewis
acids. TiCl4, TiBr4, BCl3, and BBr3 promoted syn-selective cyclizations to
sterically congested chloro- and bromohydrins, while SnCl4, SnBr4, InCl3, ZrCl4, 
and several other Lewis acids effected highly anti-selective reactions to furnish
the corresponding trans halohydrins. The stronger Lewis acids (TiX4 and BX3)
favor the syn process that involves axial delivery of a halide ligand.
Competition experiments showed that substitution at the delta carbon (methallyl
enones) led to increased rates (40-50-fold), while substitution at the epsilon
position (cis and trans crotyl enones) retarded the rate and eroded the
selectivity of the cyclizations. The trends in syn vs anti selectivity,
reactivity, and effects of different Lewis acidic metal halides are rationalized 
by competitive reaction pathways proceeding through syn carbocation-halide ion
pairs and a higher order transition state that leads to inversion of
configuration and formation of trans halohydrins, along with cyclic olefins
arising from proton elimination.

We report a case of a 39-year-old woman with a recurrent aneurysmal fibrous
histiocytoma of the right lower leg. Cytogenetic analysis of the tumor specimen
disclosed a 46,XX,t(12;19)(p12;q13) karyotype. Multicolor fluorescence in situ
hybridization (M-FISH), followed by conventional FISH analysis, confirmed the
reciprocal translocation as the sole cytogenetic anomaly, and allowed for the
positioning of chromosomes 12 and 19 breakpoints proximal to the BCL3 gene and
between ETV6 and PIK3C2G gene loci, respectively. Our case highlights the
importance of distinguishing this recurrent but benign lesion from similarly
appearing malignant skin tumors. Cytogenetic analysis may contribute to the

Isolated chromosomal translocations are important defining features of many
non-Hodgkin lymphomas, especially of B-cell type. In contrast to some other
translocations, the significance of IGH/BCL3 translocations is not well defined. 
Although often considered a feature of the ill-defined entity atypical chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, very few cases are reported in which involvement of BCL3
and the precise B-cell neoplasm are both well documented. For this reason, we
report a splenic-based CD5(-), CD10(-), CD43(-), CD23(-), CD103(-), FMC7(+),
CD25(+) small B-cell lymphoma associated with epithelioid histiocyte clusters and
a t(14;19)(q32;q13) representing an IGH/BCL3 translocation based on classical
cytogenetic studies, chromosomal painting, and fluorescence in situ hybridization
studies. The previously reported neoplasms with t(14;19)(q32;q13) or IGH/BCL3
translocations are also reviewed. The present case did not fall into any of the
classic B-cell lymphoma categories and clearly did not represent chronic
lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. This case suggests that the
IGH/BCL3 translocation may help to define a new clinicopathologic entity.

MN 55905, USA.

PURPOSE: Validation of fluorescence in situ hybridization assays is required
before using them in clinical practice. Yet, there are few published examples
that describe the validation process, leading to inconsistent and sometimes
inadequate validation practices. The purpose of this article is to describe a
broadly applicable preclinical validation process.
METHODS: Validation is performed using four consecutive experiments. The
Familiarization experiment tests probe performance on metaphase cells to measure 
analytic sensitivity and specificity for normal blood specimens. The Pilot Study 
tests a variety of normal and abnormal specimens, using the intended tissue type,
to set a preliminary normal cutoff and establish the analytic sensitivity. The
Clinical Evaluation experiment tests these parameters in a series of normal and
abnormal specimens to simulate clinical practice, establish the normal cutoff and
abnormal reference ranges, and finalize the standard operating procedure. The
Precision experiment measures the reproducibility of the new assay over 10
consecutive working days. To illustrate documentation and analysis of data with
this process, the results for a new assay to detect fusion of IGH and BCL3
associated with t(14;19)(q32;q13.3) in lymphoproliferative disorders are provided
in this report.
RESULTS: These four experiments determine the analytic sensitivity and
specificity, normal values, precision, and reportable reference ranges for
validation of the new test.
CONCLUSION: This report describes a method for preclinical validation of
fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of metaphase cells and interphase
nuclei using commercial or home brew probes.

We present the results of an extended computational study of the electric and
magnetic properties connected to Cotton-Mouton birefringences, on the trifluoro- 
and trichloroborides in the gas phase. The electric dipole polarizabilities,
magnetizabilities, quadrupole moments, and higher-order
hypersusceptibilities--expressed as quadratic and cubic frequency-dependent
response functions--are computed within Hartree-Fock, density-functional, and
coupled-cluster response theories employing singly and doubly augmented
correlation-consistent basis sets and London orbitals in the magnetic property
calculations. The results, which illustrate the capability of time-dependent
density-functional theory for electron-rich systems, are compared with available 
experimental data. Revised values of both experimentally derived quadrupole
moment of BF3, 2.72 +/- 0.15 a.u., and magnetizability anisotropy of BCl3, -0.45 
+/- 0.09 a.u., both obtained in birefringence experiments that neglect the
effects of higher-order hypersusceptibilities, are presented. In the theoretical 
limit the traceless quadrupole moments of BF3 and BCl3 are determined to be 3.00 
+/- 0.01 and 0.71 +/- 0.01 a.u., respectively.

[Possible association due to linkage disequilibrium of TGFA, RARA and BCL3 with
nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in the Chilean population].

Medicina, Universidad de Chile.

BACKGROUND: Nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (NSCLP) is a congenital malformation
with the characteristics of a complex genetic trait. Based on experimental
evidences as well as on association and linkage studies candidate genes TGFA,
RARA and BCL3 have been postulated as being involved in the genetic etiology of
this pathology.
AIM: To test the possible association due to linkage disequilibrium between
microsatellite markers located at less than 1cM from the three candidate genes
and nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate using the case-parents trio design.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 58 case-parents trios. Two
microsatellite markers, flanking each one of the candidate genes were analyzed by
means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fluorescent labeled
microsatellite markers. Electrophoresis of the PCR products was performed on a
laser-fluorescent automatic DNA sequencer. Nonparametric ETDT was used to analyze
the genotype data.
RESULTS: Significant linkage disequilibrium was detected between D2S443 (TGFA)
and NSCLP. Significance was almost reached between D17S800 (RARA) and NSCLP.
Alleles 239bp (D2S443) and 172bp (D17S800) showed significant preferential
transmission from heterozygous parents to affected offspring. In the case of BCL3
both markers showed no significant results.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study do not show clear evidence that
TGFA or RARA could be involved in the genetic etiology of NSCLP. Even though the 
importance of retinoic acid in the development of the embryo is well documented
the results obtained for RARA are difficult to analyze. In relation to the
possible role of BCL3 in NSCLP, recent information postulates that other genes
located in the same chromosome region could be involved in NSCLP.

A pathway for tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced Bcl10 nuclear translocation.
Bcl10 is up-regulated by NF-kappaB and phosphorylated by Akt1 and then complexes

Bcl10 overexpression and nuclear translocation were originally identified in

translocation. DNA amplification of Bcl10 was also found in other solid tumors.
We have recently shown that nuclear translocation of Bcl10 is a specific
molecular determinant of Helicobacter pylori-independent mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphoma (Kuo, S.-H., Chen, L. T., Yeh, K.-H., Wu, M. S., Hsu, H.

A.-L. (2004) J. Clin. Oncol. 22, 3491-3497). However, the molecular mechanism of 
Bcl10 nuclear translocation remains unknown. In this study, we observed that
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) up-regulates the expression of Bcl10 and
induces a fraction of Bcl10 nuclear translocation in human breast carcinoma MCF7 
cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift
assays indicated that an NF-kappaB-binding site resides in the Bcl10 5
'-untranslated region. This study also demonstrates that Akt1, activated by
TNFalpha, phosphorylates Bcl10 at Ser218 and Ser231 and that phosphorylated Bcl10
subsequently complexes with Bcl3 to enter the nucleus. Either inhibition of Akt1 
or depletion of Bcl3 blocks Bcl10 nuclear translocation. In summary, these
findings characterize a molecular linkage that directs Bcl10 nuclear
translocation in response to TNFalpha treatment.

Regio- and stereoselective reactions of gem-difluorinated vinyloxiranes with
heteronucleophiles.

[Reaction: see text]. Regio- and stereoselectivity in reactions of
gem-difluorinated vinyloxiranes with heteronucleophiles were successfully
controlled. Halogen atoms were introduced regioselectively at the allylic epoxide
carbon with an inversion in stereochemistry using MgBr2*Et2O or Li2CuCl4 to
produce anti-vic-halohydrine. The other diastereomers were obtained selectively
using LiBr/AcOH or BCl3, and SN2' type products were formed selectively with
excellent E preference by changing the reaction temperature. Moreover, a further 
investigation led us to find that a regio- and stereoselective SN2' addition of
several Brnsted acids was dependent on the pKa values of the acids. Under strong 
acidic conditions, we exclusively obtained E allylic alcohols.

The lowest-lying vibronic levels of the X, A, and B states of BS2 have been
investigated at high resolution using a combination of room-temperature
absorption and supersonic jet data. In both cases, the BS2 radical was prepared
in an electric discharge using a precursor gas mixture of BCl3,CS2, and either
helium or argon. Extensive absorption spectra were obtained for the 0(0)0 and
2(1)1 bands of the A2pi(u)-X2pi(g) electronic transition in the visible. The A-X 
2(1)1 and B2sigma(u)(+)-X2pi(g) 2(1) bands of jet-cooled BS2 were also studied
with laser-induced fluorescence techniques. By fitting the 0(0) bands of both
electronic transitions simultaneously, we were able to precisely determine the
spin-orbit splittings in both the A and X states. Similarly, the 21 bands were
fitted in a merged analysis in order to determine the relative separations of the
vibronic components of the ground and first excited state bending levels as
accurately as possible. Due to a large spin-orbit splitting and small
Renner-Teller interaction, the A state bending level shows small but definite
K-resonance effects, which were fitted using a full matrix for the four
components of upsilon2' = 1. The resulting parameters were used along with
previously published data to refine the Renner-Teller analyses in both the
A2pi(u), and X2pi(g) electronic states. Where possible, the fitted constants and 
observed boron isotope splittings have been shown to be in accord with
theoretical estimates of their sign and magnitude.

Transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) plays a central role in
the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). In anaplastic large-cell
lymphomas (ALCLs), which share molecular lesions with cHL, the NF-kappaB system
has not been equivalently investigated. Here we describe constitutive NF-kappaB
p50 homodimer [(p50)2] activity in ALCL cells in the absence of constitutive
activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. Furthermore, (p50)2 contributes
to the NF-kappaB activity in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Bcl-3, which is 
an inducer of nuclear (p50)2 and is associated with (p50)2 in ALCL and HRS cell
lines, is abundantly expressed in ALCL and HRS cells. Notably, a selective
overexpression of Bcl-3 target genes is found in ALCL cells. By
immunohistochemical screening of 288 lymphoma cases, a strong Bcl-3 expression in
cHL and in peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) including ALCL was
found. In 3 of 6 HRS cell lines and 25% of primary ALCL, a copy number increase
of the BCL3 gene locus was identified. Together, these data suggest that elevated
Bcl-3 expression has an important function in cHL and peripheral T-NHL, in
particular ALCL.

Stimulation of CD30 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma leads to production of
nuclear factor-kappaB p52, which is associated with hyperphosphorylated Bcl-3.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) express CD30 at
high levels, but stimulation of this molecule has been reported to induce
contradictory effects. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of CD30-mediated
apoptosis of ALCL, we compared the gene expression profiles of
t(2;5)(p23;q35)-positive ALCL with those of HL altered by CD30 agonistic
stimulation. The results showed that BCL3, the high-level expression of which in 
ALCL was previously reported, was further upregulated in response to CD30
stimulation, along with several pro-apoptotic genes. Bcl-3 protein was present as
an intermediate phospho-form in the resting-state ALCL, becoming
hyperphosphorylated (Bcl-3P) upon stimulation. We next found that the stimulation
promoted de novo synthesis of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB2/p100 precursor as
well as processing to p52, and a series of immunoprecipitation and western
blotting analyses consistently showed association of Bcl-3P with p52 in
CD30-stimulated ALCL. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed the
induction of kappaB binding activity of the p52 homodimer, and nuclear
colocalization of Bcl-3 and p52 was demonstrated in anaplastic lymphoma
kinase-positive ALCL tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. As Bcl-3 can act as
an anti-repressor or transactivator or both, we propose that the (p52)2/Bcl-3P
ternary complex, which is specifically induced in CD30-stimulated ALCL, can
modulate expression of apoptosis-related genes regulated by NF-kappaB, thereby
accounting for CD30-mediated apoptosis of ALCL.

Total synthesis of dictyodendrin B.

A concise total synthesis of dictyodendrin B (1) is reported, a scarce marine
alkaloid endowed with promising telomerase inhibitory activity. Key steps of the 
chosen route are a reductive cyclization of ketoamide 11 to indole 12 mediated by
low-valent titanium (from TiCl3 and KC8) followed by a photochemical
6pi-electrocyclization, which was performed in the presence of Pd/C and
nitrobenzene to effect concomitant dehydrogenation/aromatization of the product
initially formed. Regioselective bromination of the resulting pyrrolocarbazole 13
followed by lithium/bromine exchange and quenching of the resulting organolithium
species with p-methoxybenzaldehyde installed the side chain at C2. Oxidation of
the benzylic alcohol 15 thus obtained to ketone 17 was best achieved with
catalytic amounts of tetra-n-propylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) and
N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO) in dilute CH2Cl2 solution to avoid the formation
of undue amounts of the unsymmetrical dimer 16. Ketone 17 was elaborated into the
natural product by selective cleavage of the isopropyl ether with BCl3,
introduction of the sulfate moiety with the aid of trichloroethyl chlorosulfuric 
acid ester, deprotection of all lateral methyl ether groups, and final reductive 
cleavage of the trichloroethyl ester moiety. The spectroscopic data of synthetic 
dictyodendrin B thus formed matched those of an authentic sample in all regards. 
Moreover, it was shown that global deprotection of the peripheral -OH groups in
pyrrolo[2,3-c]carbazole 13 is accompanied by spontaneous air-oxidation to form
the quinone core of dictyodendrin C.

A combined vacuum ultraviolet laser and synchrotron pulsed field ionization study
of BCl3.

Yang J(1), Mo Y, Lau KC, Song Y, Qian XM, Ng CY.

(1)Department of Physics and Key Laboratory for Atomic and Molecular
Nanosciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.

The pulsed field ionization-photoelectron (PFI-PE) spectrum of boron trichloride 
(BCl3) in the region of 93 590-95 640 cm(-1) has been measured using vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV) laser. At energies 0-1100 cm(-1) above the adiabatic ionization
energy (IE) of BCl3, the bending vibration progression of BCl3+ is clearly
resolved in the PFI-PE spectrum, whereas the spectrum at energies 1200-1900
cm(-1) above the IE (BCl3) is found to exhibit dense vibrational structure. This 
observation unambiguously shows that BCl3+ in its ground state has C2v symmetry. 
Ab initio calculations performed at the CCSD(T)/CBS level with high-level
corrections are consistent with this observation, indicating that the BCl3+(X
2B2) ground state has two long and one short B-Cl bonds. Furthermore, the
CCSD(T)/CBS calculations predict the existence of two BCl3+ transitional
structures with D3h and C2v symmetries lying 800 and 1300 cm(-1), respectively,
above the BCl3+ (X 2B2) ground state. This prediction is also consistent with the
dense features observed in the PFI-PE spectrum in the region of 1200-1900 cm(-1) 
above the IE (BCl3). The assignment of the PFI-PE vibrational bands gives the IE 
(BCl3) = 93 891 +/- 2 cm (11.6410 +/- 0.0003 eV) and the bending frequencies for 
BCl3+ (X 2B2), v1+ (b2) = 194 cm(-1) and v1+ (a1) = 209 cm We have also examined 
the dissociative photoionization process BCl3 + hu --> BCl2 (+) + Cl + e- using
the synchrotron based PFI-PE-photoion coincidence method, yielding the 0 K
threshold or appearance energy (AE) for this process to be 12.495 +/- 0.002 eV.
Combining this 0 K AE value and the IE (BCl3), we have determined the 0 K bond
dissociation energy (D0) for Cl2B(+) -Cl as 0.854 +/- 0.002 eV. This experimental
and theoretical study indicates that the CCSD (T, Full)/CBS calculations with
high-level corrections are highly reliable for the predictions of IE (BCl3), AE
(BCI2+) and D0 (Cl2B(+) -Cl) with error limits of less than 35 meV. However, the 
CCSD (T, Full)/CBS predictions for deltaH(f0) degrees (BCl3), deltaH(f0) degrees 
(BCl2+), and deltaH(f0)degrees (BCl3+) are less reliable with discrepancies up to
0.1 eV as compared to the experimental determinations.

BACKGROUND: Brain death (BD) and the subsequent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury
have cardinal implications for the pathogenesis of kidney transplantation (Tx).
However, the precise mechanistic pathway of BD and the subsequent I/R injury are 
unknown. In this study, we performed genome-wide analysis for differential gene
expression in kidney isografts from BD donors. Their gene expressions were
compared with those from living sources.
METHODS: Kidneys from BD rats were engrafted and their gene expressions were
compared with those from living controls. Donors were intubated, and mechanically
ventilated for 6 hours. Grafts were harvested 6 hours after BD, and 1 hour after 
engraftment. The expression profile of approximately 20,500 genes was analyzed.
RESULTS: Gene expression of chemokines (Scya2 and Gro1), cytokines (IL-1 and -6) 
and adhesion molecules (E- and P-selectin and ICAM-1) were upregulated in the BD 
kidneys and 1 hour after engraftment. An antiapoptotic gene (Birc2),
IkappaB-zeta, and protective gene (HO-1) were also upregulated. Other upregulated
genes included oncogenes (lipocalin2, Bcl3, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
delta), Calgranulin B, DEXRAS1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1,
inhibin beta-B-subunit gene, IgG Fc receptor, and FK 506 binding protein 5. We
also observed downregulation of the genes Amphiphsin, Jagged 1, Pace 4, Slc15a2, 
Kcnn2, and gap junction membrane channel protein alpha5 only in kidneys from BD
donors.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of global gene expression analysis
using the rat brain-death isograft model. These results provide new insights for 
the detection of novel target genes for treatment and prognosis of grafts from
brain-dead and extended marginal donors.

Disruption of either the Nfkb1 or the Bcl3 gene inhibits skeletal muscle atrophy.

Author information:

The intracellular signals that mediate skeletal muscle protein loss and
functional deficits due to muscular disuse are just beginning to be elucidated.
Previously we showed that the activity of an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene
was markedly increased in unloaded muscles, and p50 and Bcl-3 proteins were
implicated in this induction. In the present study, mice with a knockout of the
p105/p50 (Nfkb1) gene are shown to be resistant to the decrease in soleus fiber
cross-sectional area that results from 10 days of hindlimb unloading.
Furthermore, the marked unloading-induced activation of the NF-kappaB reporter
gene in soleus muscles from WT mice was completely abolished in soleus muscles
from Nfkb1 knockout mice. Knockout of the B cell lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) gene also
showed an inhibition of fiber atrophy and an abolition of NF-kappaB reporter
activity. With unloading, fast fibers from WT mice atrophied to a greater extent 
than slow fibers. Resistance to atrophy in both strains of knockout mice was
demonstrated clearly in fast fibers, while slow fibers from only the Bcl3(-/-)
mice showed atrophy inhibition. The slow-to-fast shift in myosin isoform
expression due to unloading was also abolished in both Nfkb1 and Bcl3 knockout
mice. Like the soleus muscles, plantaris muscles from Nfkb1(-/-) and Bcl3(-/-)
mice also showed inhibition of atrophy with unloading. Thus both the Nfkb1 and
the Bcl3 genes are necessary for unloading-induced atrophy and the associated
phenotype transition.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the linkage between candidate genes on chromosome 19
and cleft lip with or without cleft palate in Japanese using a parametric method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After informed consent was obtained, blood samples were
drawn from 90 individuals in 14 families, 30 of whom were affected, and genomic
DNAs were extracted. PCR-amplified products using four microsatellite markers,
D19S178, BCL3, APOC2[007/008] and APOC2[AC1/AC2] located in 19q13.2, were
separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Linkage analysis was carried 
out using the MLINK and LINKMAP programs, and logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were
calculated for each family.
RESULTS: Before undertaking linkage analysis, we analyzed 74 healthy Japanese
subjects and found racial differences in that the observed number of alleles and 
their heterozygosity were lower in Japanese than in Caucasians, and that both
populations tended to show a different allele distribution. In 14 families,
two-point maximum LOD score (Zmax) for BCL3 was 0.341 and multi-point Zmax was
less than -2 excluding linkage. But in 9 families with left and bilateral CL/P,
two-point Zmax for APOC2[AC1/AC2] was 1.701 and multi-point Zmax at APOC2 locus
was 1.909.
CONCLUSION: The LOD score was relatively high but provided no evidence of linkage
for CL/P to BCL3 and nearby genes in Japanese subjects.

Persistence rewarded: successful observation of the B 2Sigmau+-X 2Pig electronic 
transition of jet-cooled BS2.

He SG(1), Clouthier DJ.

The B-X electronic transition of jet-cooled BS2 has been observed using
laser-induced fluorescence techniques. The boron disulfide radical was produced
in a pulsed electric discharge jet using a mixture of BCl3 and CS2 in
high-pressure argon as the precursor. The spectrum consists of a strong 0(0)(0)
band with the 2Sigma-2Pi(3/2) component at 24,393.2 cm(-1) and short progressions
in the symmetric stretching (nu1' = 506.7 cm(-1)) and bending (nu2' = 303.2
cm(-1)) modes. A rotational analysis of both spin-orbit components of the 0(0)(0)
band gave an upper state B value of 0.0932779(19) cm(-1) and a ground-state
spin-orbit coupling constant of A = -405.163(4) cm(-1). The ground-state bond
length of 1.66492 angstroms increases to 1.6812(1) angstroms on sigmau --> pig
electronic excitation. The B-X data have been used to further refine the
Renner-Teller analysis, which is in good agreement with our previous work [J.
Chem. Phys. 119, 2047 (2003)].

Maternal MTHFR interacts with the offspring's BCL3 genotypes, but not with TGFA, 
in increasing risk to nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate.

Paulo, Brazil.

The 677 C --> T polymorphism in the 5-10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) gene has been associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without
cleft palate (CL/P) in some populations, but not others. Previous studies (ie,
case-control and transmission disequilibrium tests (TDT)) in Brazilian families
with CL/P have been unable to replicate this putative association. However, our
group observed a lower proportion of CT heterozygotes among the mothers of CL/P
probands, suggesting that the maternal genotype for this polymorphism might
influence predisposition to CL/P. In order to further examine this issue, we
performed a case-control study of the 677 C --> T/MTHFR polymorphism in families 
with CL/P ascertained in two regions of Brazil: 172 from São Paulo (SP) and 252
from Ceará (CE). The control samples included 243 individuals from SP and 401
from CE. TDT was carried out in 102 patients with CL/P and their parents. No
evidence of an association was observed between the 677 C --> T/MTHFR
polymorphism and CL/P using the case-control design, while borderline
significance was obtained with the TDT (P=0.055). We have also looked for an
interaction between maternal MTHFR genotypes and the propositi offspring's
genotypes at two candidate susceptibility loci for CL/P, TGFA and BCL3.
Interestingly, we observed an interaction between the maternal MTHFR and
offspring's BCL3 genotypes (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-4.8; P=0.03) but not with the
offspring's TGFA genotypes. Therefore, our results reinforce the idea that the
maternal MTHFR genotype plays a significant role in susceptibility to CL/P, but
its teratogenic effect depends on the genotype of the offspring.

Association between 10 microsatellite markers and nonsyndromic cleft lip palate
in the Chilean population.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this case-control study was to evaluate the possible
association between nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (NSCLP) and 10 genetic markers 
in four chromosomal regions in the admixed Spanish-Amerindian Chilean population.
SETTING: Study participants included 56 patients with NSCLP identified and
interviewed for positive family history during the course of clinical
examinations at different rehabilitation centers in the cities of Santiago and
Talca, Chile. A control group of 59 normal individuals without known familial
antecedents of clefting was obtained from blood bank donors of the University
Hospital, University of Chile. Cases and controls belonged to low- to low-middle 
socioeconomic strata.
RESULTS: Ten markers from chromosome 4p, 4q, 6p, 17q, and 19q were assessed
(MSX1, D4S175, D4S192, F13A1, EDN1, D6S89, D6S105, D6S109, D17S579, BCL3). Four
of them showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations in
controls, according to the exact test (D4S192, BCL3, F13A1, and D6S89). The
case-control comparison by means of the CLUMP program showed significant
differences only in BCL3, and D6S109 almost reached statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the genetic regions with positive results in Caucasian
populations may not be involved in NSCLP in Chile, regardless of the positive
evidence for the candidate region on chromosome 19. Similar findings have been
reported recently in the Chinese population.

Why is BCl3 a stronger Lewis acid with respect to strong bases than BF3?

Bessac F(1), Frenking G.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratoire de Physique Quantique, Université Paul Sabatier, 118 Route de
Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France.

Geometries and bond dissociation energies of the complexes Cl(3)B[bond]NH(3) and 
F(3)B[bond]NH(3) have been calculated using DFT (PW91) and ab initio methods at
the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels using large basis sets. The calculations give a larger
bond dissociation energy for Cl(3)B[bond]NH(3) than for F(3)B[bond]NH(3).
Calculations of the deformation energy of the bonded fragments reveal that the
distortion of BCl(3) and BF(3) from the equilibrium geometry to the pyramidal
form in the complexes requires nearly the same energy. The higher Lewis acid
strength of BCl(3) in X(3)B[bond]H(3) compared with BF(3) is an intrinsic
property of the molecule. The energy partitioning analysis of Cl(3)B[bond]NH(3)
and F(3)B[bond]NH(3) shows that the stronger bond in the former complex comes
from enhanced covalent interactions between the Lewis acid and the Lewis base
which can be explained with the energetically lower lying LUMO of BCl(3).

overexpression of BCL3. We report six patients with B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia who have a cytogenetically identical translocation with
different breakpoints at the molecular level. Fluorescence in situ hybridization 
with locus-specific probes confirmed the involvement of the IGH@ gene but showed 
that the breakpoint on 19q13 lay outside the region documented in
t(14;19)(q32;q13)-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This newly described
translocation constitutes a distinct cytogenetic subgroup that is confined to
older children and younger adults with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.

Exposure to soluble protein Ags in vivo leads to abortive proliferation of
responding T cells. In the absence of a danger signal, artificially provided by
adjuvants, most responding cells die, and the remainder typically become anergic.
The adjuvant-derived signals provided to T cells are poorly understood, but
recent work has identified BCL3 as the gene, of those tested, with the greatest
differential transcriptional response to adjuvant administration in vivo. As an
initial step in analyzing transcriptional responses of BCL3 in T cells, we have
identified candidate regulatory regions within the locus through their
evolutionary conservation and by analysis of DNase hypersensitivity. An
evolutionarily conserved DNase hypersensitive site (HS3) within intron 2 was
found to act as a transcriptional enhancer in response to stimuli that mimic TCR 
activation, namely, PHA and PMA. In luciferase reporter gene constructs
transiently transfected into the Jurkat T cell line, the HS3 enhancer can
cooperate not only with the BCL3 promoter, but also with an exogenous promoter
from herpes simplex thymidine kinase. Deletional analysis revealed that a minimal
sequence of approximately 81 bp is required for full enhancer activity. At the 5'
end of this minimal sequence is a kappaB site, as confirmed by EMSAs. Mutation of
this site in the context of the full-length HS3 abolished enhancer activity.
Cotransfection with NF-kappaB p65 expression constructs dramatically increased
luciferase activity, even without stimulation. Conversely, cotransfection with
the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha reduced activation. Together, these results 
demonstrate a critical role for NF-kappaB in BCL3 transcriptional up-regulation
by TCR-mimetic signals.

Molecular characterization of a new gene, CEAL1, encoding for a carcinoembryonic 
antigen-like protein with a highly conserved domain of eukaryotic translation
initiation factors.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a complex immunoreactive glycoprotein belonging
to a large and heterogeneous group of cross-reacting proteins known as the CEA
gene family, which contains 29 genes/pseudogenes. CEA is used as a valuable serum
tumor marker for monitoring response to therapy in patients with various solid
tumors. Through the positional cloning approach we have identified and
characterized a CEA-like gene (CEAL1), a novel member of the CEA multigene
family. We have characterized the complete genomic structure of CEAL1, as well as
one alternative splice variant and determined its chromosomal localization. The
new gene is comprised of eight exons, with seven intervening introns and it is
localized to chromosome 19q13.2 between the markers D19S574 and D19S219,
approximately 60 kb upstream of the BCL3 gene. The protein-coding region of the
gene is formed of 903 bp, encoding for a 300-amino-acid polypeptide with a
predicted molecular weight of 32.6 kDa and isoelectric point of 5.74. The CEAL1
protein contains two Immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) transmembrane domains, which
are present in most of the CEA proteins, as well as one highly conserved domain
of eukaryotic translation initiation factors. The identified alternative spliced 
variant has one more exon of 134 bp. This splice variant is expected to encode
for a truncated protein of 142 amino acids with the eIF5A domain and without Ig
homology domain. CEAL1 mRNA is expressed in a variety of tissues, but highest
levels are found in the prostate, uterus, fetal brain, mammary, adrenal gland,
skeletal muscle, small intestine and kidney. CEAL1 is highly expressed in BT-474,
BT20, T47D and, at much lower levels, in MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. The new
gene is also highly expressed in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. The CEAL1
gene was found to be down-regulated by dexamethasone in BT-474 breast cancer cell
lines. Our data suggest that this gene is overexpressed in a subset of ovarian
cancers which are clinically more aggressive.

Improved procedures for the generation of diborane from sodium borohydride and
boron trifluoride.

Kanth JV(1), Brown HC.

Author information: 
(1)H. C. Brown and R. B. Wetherill Laboratories of Chemistry, Purdue University, 
West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA.

Improved procedures for the generation of diborane by the reaction of NaBH4 in
triglyme or tetraglyme with the BF3 adducts of di-n-butyl ether, tert-butyl
methyl ether, monoglyme, dioxane, and tetrahydropyran were developed. In these
systems, generation of diborane requires 2-4 h at 25 degrees C (faster reactions 
take place at 50 degrees C). The byproduct NaBF4 precipitates from the reaction
mixture at 25 degrees C as the reaction proceeds. The high-boiling glyme can be
conveniently separated from the lower boiling carrier ethers by simple
distillation of the latter. On the other hand, diborane was generated very slowly
or not generated using the addition of each of six boron trifluoride-etherates
(di-n-butyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran,
dioxane, and monoglyme) to suspensions of sodium borohydride in the corresponding
ether. However, diborane was generated rapidly and quantitatively by the addition
of NaBH4 in triglyme (or tetraglyme) to the BF3 adduct of triglyme (or
tetraglyme) at room temperature. No solid precipitation occurs during the
reaction, making it convenient for large-scale applications. The pure solvent
triglyme (or tetraglyme) can be easily recovered and recycled by either
crystallizing or precipitating NaBF4 from the generation flask. New procedures
for the generation of diborane were also developed by the reaction of NaBF4 with 
NaBH4 in triglyme (or tetraglyme) in the presence of Lewis acids such as AlCl3
and BCl3.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with t(2;5)(p23;q35) and Hodgkin disease
(HD) share many cellular features, including expression of CD30. We compared gene
expression profiles of 4 ALCL (Karpas 299, SU-DHL-1, DEL, SR-786) and 3 HD cell
lines and found that BCL3, which encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the I
kappa B family of inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)
transcriptional factors, was expressed at higher levels in ALCL than HD. Northern
and Western blotting analyses confirmed the high-level expression of BCL3 in ALCL
at both mRNA and protein levels. We established a real-time reverse
transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction assay to measure the BCL3 mRNA
level and found a predominant level of BCL3 expression in t(2;5)(+) ALCL; the
levels of cell lines and clinical materials were comparable to or higher than
that of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia carrying t(14;19)(q32;q13).
Southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization disclosed that the BCL3 
gene copies were amplified in SU-DHL-1, whereas Karpas 299 carried 4 BCL3 gene
loci. The BCL3 gene contains 2 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) islands, and
the intragenic 3' CpG was entirely demethylated in SU-DHL-1 and DEL. In contrast 
to HD, in which NF-kappa B was constitutively activated, ALCL cells consistently 
showed (p50)(2) homodimer binding activity on electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. It is suggested that the high-level nuclear Bcl-3 sequesters the (p50)(2) 
homodimer to the nucleus, which may account for the contradictory effect of CD30 
stimulation on ALCL and HD. We propose that BCL3 is overexpressed by genetic and 
epigenetic modifications, potentially contributing to the development of
t(2;5)(+) ALCL.

Evidence that BCL3 plays a role in the etiology of nonsyndromic oral clefts in
Brazilian families.

São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

The BCL3 gene has been considered a susceptibility locus for nonsyndromic cleft
lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), based on association and linkage
studies in some populations. We evaluated an intragenic marker at the BCL3 gene
and the microsatellite D19S178 (1.1 cM distant from the BCL3 gene) among 98
infants born with NSCL/P and their parents, using the transmission disequilibrium
test (TDT) and a method for haplotype analysis. Our analysis, based on BCL3
alleles, revealed the existence of a marginal association of allele 135pb of the 
BCL3 gene with NSCL/P (chi(2)=3.60; P=0.058; 1 df), with a major effect in female
(chi(2)=5.77; P=0.016; 1 df) and in familial cases (chi(2)=3.79; P=0.051; 1 df). 
However, the haplotype analysis detected no significant segregation distortion,
even if the alleles of the D19S178 were grouped into two classes. These findings 
support previous findings that BCL3 plays a role in the etiology of NSCL/P as an 
allele of low penetrance or as a modifier locus. We hypothesize that there might 
be more than one mutation in this gene associated with NSCL/P, or alternatively, 
that more than one mutation has arisen associated with the 135-bp allele. Genet.

Probing biomolecular interactions of glutathione transferase M2-2 by using
peptide phage display.

Edalat M(1), Pettersson S, Persson MA, Mannervik B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Biomedical Center Box 576, Uppsala University, 751
23 Uppsala, Sweden.

The interactions between biomolecules and human glutathione transferase M2-2 (GST
M2-2) were probed by using 9- and 15-mer combinatorial peptide libraries
displayed on phage. The peptide libraries were based on random DNA sequences
fused to gIII, a gene that expresses a phage coat protein and thus causes the
peptides to be displayed on the surface of phage particles. A peptide sequence
was enriched through binding to GST M2-2, which indicated a successful selection.
Binding studies with the peptide displayed on phage showed binding specificity.
The sequence of the peptide had similarities to segments of proteins in the
Swiss-Prot Database, to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and to the protein Bcl3.
JNK is linked to the regulation of the transcription factor AP-1. Use of
cell-based assays of the transcriptional activity of AP-1 allowed a novel
coactivation function of GST M2-2 to be demonstrated. Specificity in the
activation was indicated by the lack of effect of GST A1-1. No coactivator
function of GST M2-2 could be demonstrated in assays with Bcl3. These results
suggest that GST M2-2 has biological roles in addition to catalysis of
detoxication reactions, and demonstrate the potential of phage display in
functional genomics research.

The recurrent cytogenetic (CG) abnormality t(14;19)(q32;q13) involving the
oncogene BCL3 is described in patients with atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). We report four patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) bearing
t(14;19). All cases were female and their age ranged from 62 to 91.
Histologically, there were two cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), both
CD11c positive with atypical morphology, one case of Burkitt like lymphoma (BLL),
and one case of diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLC-L). One SLL patient showed
t(14;19) as the sole abnormality and experienced a benign course for 8 years. The
other three cases showed secondary CG progression, including tetraploidy,
del(6q), t(8;22) and del(13q). These cases were aggressive in clinical behavior, 
including an SLL case which transformed to DLC lymphoma in 4 months. Southern
analysis and long distance PCR confirmed BCL3/IgH Calpha translocation in one
case. We propose that NHLs with t(14;19) may have evolved from the same spectrum 
of disease as atypical CLL. The poor prognosis of t(14;19) disease is associated 
with the occurrence of recurrent secondary CG changes, commonly found in B cell
lymphoproliferative diseases.

The configuration of the immunoglobulin genes in B cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia.

B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lacks a consistent genetic abnormality.
However, immunoglobulin V(H) gene segment mutation analysis has provided insights
into the pathogenesis of these diseases and allowed the development of powerful
prognostic markers. Immunoglobulin gene chromosomal translocations are rare in
CLL and involve a distinct subset of genes including BCL3, BCL11A and CCND2. BCL2
translocations in CLL appear to arise via a different mechanism from comparable
translocations seen in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Medicina, Universidad de Chile.

BACKGROUND: In the search of the major genes responsible for the genetic etiology
of Nonsyndromic Cleft Lip and Palate (NSCLP), an association study between this
malformation and four molecular markers, F13A1 and EDN1 (6p), D17S579 (17q) and
BCL3 (19q), was done.
AIM: To determine, in a Chilean population, the presence of NSCLP susceptibility 
regions, as proposed for Caucasian populations in the 6p, 17q and 19q chromosomal
regions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of unrelated NSCLP patients, that belonged to
Simplex (Sx) and Multiplex (Mx) families, was analyzed. Blood donors were used as
a control group (Co). The DNA of the four markers was amplified by means of PCR, 
their products analyzed by PAGE denaturants and visualized by silver staining.
Statistical analysis was performed using chi 2 log ratio.
RESULTS: Allele frequency distribution of D17S579 was significantly different in 
all patients with NSCLP and their subgroups, when compared to control subjects.
Significant differences in EDN1 frequency were observed between the total groups 
of NSCLP patients and those pertaining to the Mx subgroup, when compared to
controls. Differences in F13A1 distribution were only observed between NSCLP-Mx
patients and controls. There was a slight difference in BCL3 distribution,
between the total sample of NSCLP patients and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis of the existence of cleft
susceptibility regions in 6p and 17q. The small significance of BCL3, suggests
that ethnicity can influence the interactions between involved genes.

Transfer of micro-optical structures into GaAs by use of inductively coupled
plasma dry etching.

The transfer of continuous-relief micro-optical structures from resist into GaAs 
by the use of direct-write electron-beam (e-beam) lithography followed by dry
etching in an inductively coupled plasma is demonstrated. BCl3-Ar chemistry was
found to give satisfactory results; N2 and Cl2 were added to change the
selectivity between GaAs and e-beam resist. The transfer process generates smooth
etched structures. Distortion of the diffractive structures in the transfer
process was examined. Blazed gratings with a period of 10 microns were optically 
evaluated with a 940-nm VCSEL. This grating was a five-step approximation of a
blazed profile. The diffraction efficiency was 67% in the first order, with a
theoretical value of 87%. Also, simulations of the optical performance of the
transferred diffractive elements were made by use of a Fourier transform of the
grating profile. Our goal is to integrate micro-optical structures with VCSELs.

Cytogenetic characterization of diffuse large cell lymphoma using multi-color
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Center, Omaha, NE, USA.

We have employed multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) to
characterize the cytogenetic changes in 20 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
(DLBCL), that contained complex and partially characterized karyotypes. The
M-FISH analysis helped to delineate 94% of the unidentified abnormalities and
assisted in redefining some unidentified/misidentified karyotypic changes.
Recurrent breakpoints observed in approximately 20% cases included 14q32, 3p21,
3q27, 22q12, 1q25, and 18q21 (in decreasing order), and 1p22, 1q21, 4q31, 6q21,
and 8q24 (in four cases each). Numerical gain of chromosomes 7, 9, 12, and X and 
loss of chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 17, and Y, were noted in approximately 20% of cases.
The minimum deleted regions encompassed 6q21-q25, 1p22-p36, 1q32-q44, 2p23-p25,
4q31-q35, 13p13-q14, and 17p11-p13. Two cases presented with a sole structural
abnormality, and one contained a der(17)t(9;17)(p21;p13), which has not been
reported earlier as a sole abnormality in DLBCL. Upon completely characterizing
the karyotypes, we observed with interesting that in 55% of the cases, more than 
one BCL gene bearing regions was involved in translocations. In the remaining
45%, where only one or none of the BCL gene regions was involved in a
rearrangement, we observed the loss of chromosomes 6 and/or 17 or partial
deletions of 6q and/or 17p or gain of 7 and/or 12. Our findings suggest that,
although BCL2 and BCL6 are most often implicated in DLBCL, the possibility of the
disruptions of BCL3, BCL8, BCL9, and BCL10 as a "primary event" in DLBCL cannot
be ruled out. Most often, a combination of events may be necessary for the
genesis of DLBCL or progression of follicular lymphoma to DLBCL. Overall, M-FISH 
has enhanced our ability to provide a comprehensive karyotypic analysis, and has 
helped in defining the importance of BCL3, BCL8, BCL9, and BCL10 carrying
breakpoints in DLBCL.

Molecular regulation of urothelial renewal and host defenses during infection
with uropathogenic Escherichia coli.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the principal cause of urinary tract
infection in women, attaches to the superficial facet cell layer of the bladder
epithelium (urothelium) via its FimH adhesin. Attachment triggers exfoliation of 
bacteria-laden superficial facet cells, followed by rapid reconstitution of the
urothelium through differentiation of underlying basal and intermediate cells. We
have used DNA microarrays to define the molecular regulators of urothelial
renewal and host defense expressed in adult C57Bl/6 female mice during the early 
phases of infection with isogenic virulent (FimH+) or avirulent (FimH-) UPEC
strains. The temporal evolution and cellular origins of selected responses were
then characterized by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, in situ
hybridization, and immunohistochemical analyses. Well before exfoliation is
evident, FimH-mediated attachment suppresses transforming growth factor-beta
(Bmp4) and Wnt5a/Ca(2+) signaling to promote subsequent differentiation of
basal/intermediate cells. The early transcriptional responses to attachment also 
include induction of regulators of proliferation (e.g. epidermal growth factor
family members), induction of the ETS transcription factor Elf3, which
transactivates genes involved in epithelial differentiation and host defense
(inducible nitric-oxide synthase), induction of modulators, and mediators of
pro-inflammatory responses (e.g. Socs3, Cebp/delta, Bcl3, and CC/CXC chemokines),
induction of modulators of apoptotic responses (A20), and induction of
intermediate cell tight junction components (claudin-4). Both early and late
phases of the host response exhibit remarkable specificity for the FimH+ strain
and provide new insights about the molecular cascade mobilized to combat
UPEC-associated urinary tract infection.

It has been shown that some cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with 
a hemophagocytic syndrome (B-LAHS) have chromosomal abnormalities at 14q32 or
19q13. We report here a 64-year-old woman with B-LAHS and a complex karyotype
including add(14)(q32). We applied spectral karyotyping and revealed that the
add(14)(q32) was derived from a der(14)t(14;19)(q32;q13). However, rearrangement 
of the BCL3 gene at 19q13 could not be detected by Southern blot analysis. Our
results indicate that the translocation involving 19q13 may be one of the
recurrent aberrations in B-LAHS and that the molecular mechanism of
t(14;19)(q32;q13) in B-LAHS appear to be different from that observed in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia.

To detect immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene translocations with specific
oncogene loci, we established an interphase cytogenetic approach using
double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (DC-FISH), which we used to
analyze 173 patients with B-cell lymphoma. DC-FISH using the IGH gene (14q32.3)
in combination with c-MYC (8q24.1), BCL1 (11q13.3), BCL2 (18q21.3), BCL6 (3q27), 
and PAX-5 (9p13) gene probes detected IGH translocations in 70 (40.5%) of 173
patients. The partner genes involved in IGH translocations were identified in 56 
(80%) of 70 patients, and fusion of the IGH gene with specific oncogenes was
detected in 53 of 56 patients, particularly in interphase nuclei of 28 patients
for whom cytogenetic analysis was not informative. The most common partner gene
was BCL2 (19 patients; 27% of IGH translocation-positive patients), followed by
BCL6 (16; 23%), BCL1 (11; 16%), c-MYC (7; 10%), and PAX-5 (2; 3%). These
oncogenes were closely associated with subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. The other
partners were 19q13 (BCL3), 6p25 (MUM1/IRF4), 1q36, and chromosome 8 identified
in one patient each. Six of the nine patients with add(14)(q32) showed a BCL6/IGH
translocation. Double translocations of the IGH gene were found in three
patients; c-MYC+BCL1, c-MYC+BCL2, and c-MYC+BCL6 in each one. Interphase FISH
using specific IGH-translocation probes is valuable for defining clinically
meaningful subgroups of B-cell lymphoma.

(1)The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.

PURPOSE: Isolated, nonsyndromic oral clefts cases (n = 171) and unaffected
controls (n = 182) were used to identify both genetic and environmental risk
factors.
METHODS: Infants born in Maryland between 1992 to 1998 with an isolated,
nonsyndromic oral cleft [cleft lip (CL), cleft lip and palate (CLP), or cleft
palate (CP)] were recruited and exposure plus family history data were collected.
Controls were unaffected infants. DNA was collected from all cases and their
parents, plus controls.
RESULTS: No statistically significant association was found between any of the
following: maternal smoking, vitamin use, urinary tract infection, or
recreational drug use in either univariate analysis or after adjusting for
maternal age and education. More control mothers reported alcohol use during the 
critical time period of pregnancy (one month before conception through the first 
trimester) as compared to case mothers. There was a 10-fold increase in risk to
siblings of cases as compared to siblings of controls. Markers at four candidate 
genes were examined: transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), transforming
growth factor beta 3 (TGF beta 3), MSX1, and BCL3. Only MSX1 showed significant
differences in allele frequencies between CP cases and controls. MSX1 also showed
significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium with a susceptibility gene
controlling risk for CP.
CONCLUSION: Most environmental risk factors examined here gave little evidence of
association with risk to isolated, nonsyndromic oral clefts, although any alcohol
consumption seemed protective. MSX1 showed evidence of linkage disequilibrium in 
both case-control and case-parent trio analysis.

Stimulation of vascular endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNFalpha) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and vascular
diseases. Changes in the gene expression profile in cultured human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with TNFalpha was analyzed with high-density
oligonucleotide arrays comprised of 35,000 genes. TNFalpha stimulation profoundly
induced genes involved in signal transduction, leukocyte adhesion and
chemoattraction. ICAM-1 mRNA (fold change 111.9) was most profoundly induced
followed by TNFalpha receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) (95.5), Bcl3 (71.8),
IL8 (65.4), fractalkaine (62.4), E-selectin (48.0), lymphotoxin beta (41.3) and
VCAM-1 (31.7). In addition to these previously known genes, 18 poorly
characterized or novel genes known as ESTs profoundly induced by TNFalpha.
Initial sequencing analysis identified three of these the genes for squalene
epoxydase, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4, and CLP respectively.
Further analysis of these genes will provide important information about TNFalpha
signaling and function in vascular endothelial cells.

Fragment mode analysis and its application to the vibrational normal modes of
boron trichloride-ammonia and boron trichloride-pyridine complexes.

A method for expressing quantitatively the vibrational normal modes of a molecule
in a basis set consisting of the normal vibrations (plus translations and
rotations) of its constituent fragments is presented. The method is illustrated
by describing the vibrational modes of BCl3-NH3 and BCl3-pyridine electron
donor-acceptor complexes in terms of motions of BCl3 and either NH3 or pyridine. 
These complexes show examples of mixing between modes located on different
fragments, mixing between modes of one fragment due to symmetry lowering, and the
transformation of six fragment translations/rotations into vibrations of the
complex. Although perturbation theory has been proposed to explain such examples 
of mode mixing, calculations imply that interactions between fragments of both
complexes are too strong for perturbation theory to be generally applicable. In
addition, the transformation of fragment rotations and/or translations into
vibrations of the composite molecule will always occur and cannot be understood
in detail by using perturbation theory. For the BCl3-pyridine complex, a band
observed at 1107 cm(-1) is re-assigned as a combination of C-H in-plane bending
and a ring-breathing mode of the pyridine fragment.

The reaction of 5,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)cyclopentadiene with CpZrCl3 (Cp = eta
5-C5H5) affords the monostannylated metallocene complex (eta 5-Me3SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 
(1), accompanied by variable amounts of (eta 5-ClMe2SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 (2). The
complex (1) reacts with BCl3 or with ICl to afford 2 (Sn-CH3 cleavage), but with 
HCl, Cp2ZrCl2 is obtained instead (Sn-Cp cleavage). Depending on the reaction
conditions, treatment of either 1 or 2 with BBr3 affords (eta
5-BrMe2SnC5H4)CpZrBr2 (3) or (eta 5-Br2MeSnC5H4)CpZrBr2 (4). The reaction of 1
with excess I2 affords the iodostannylated complex (eta 5-IMe2SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 (5).
Two of the complexes (2.2C6H5CH3 and 4.THF) are crystallographically
characterized. The adduct 4.THF has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry
about tin with a long O-Sn distance of 2.655 A. We find overall that Me3Sn
substituents undergo electrophilic halodemethylation much more readily than
corresponding Me3Si substituents, whereas the reactivities of the halostannylated
complexes toward nucleophiles such as airborne moisture are much lower than those
of their halosilylated counterparts.

Group 3-15 metal chlorides (Lewis acids) were classified on the basis of activity
and aldehyde- and aldimine-selectivity in an addition reaction of a silyl enol
ether. Based on the experimental results, metal chlorides (Lewis acids) were
classified as follows: A, active; B, weak; C, inactive for the activation of the 
aldehyde and/or aldimines. Groups A and B were further divided into A-1 or B-1
(aldehyde-selective), A-2 or B-2 (aldimine-selective), and A-3 or B-3 (neutral). 
The final classification is as follows: A-1, BCl3, AlCl3, TiCl4, GaCl3, ZrCl4,
SnCl4, SbCl5, SbCl3, HfCl4, ReCl5; A-2, ScCl3, FeCl3, InCl3, BiCl3; A-3, NbCl5,

FeCl2, CoCl2, CuCl, CuCl2, GeCl4, YCl3, OsCl3, PtCl2; B-3, ZnCl2, RuCl3; C, VCl3,
CrCl3, MnCl2, NiCl2, RhCl3, PdCl2, AgCl, CdCl2, IrCl3, AuCl, HgCl2, HgCl, PbCl2. 
This classification has revealed several new fundamental aspects of elements
(metal chlorides) as Lewis acids.

Dynamical Auger emission induced by multistate vibronic coupling in the
core-excited states of the BCl3 molecule.

The Auger emission following the resonant excitation of the BCl3 molecule has
been investigated using monochromatized synchrotron radiation. The B 1s
excitation to the unoccupied Anti-bonding 4e(') orbital enhances the shoulder
structure in the low kinetic energy side of the photoemission from the 2e(')
valence bonding orbital. Based on a series of quantum mechanical calculations,
this shoulder structure is interpreted as the dynamical Auger emission which
reflects the B-Cl stretching nuclear motion and appears as a result of the purely
multistate vibronic coupling effect among the Jahn-Teller split B 1s(-1)4e(') E' 
states and the closely lying B 1s(-1)3a(')(1) A'1 state.

The reactivity of strained [1]ferrocenophanes, [Fe(eta-C5H4)2ERx] (ERx = SiMe2,
1a: SiMePh, 1b; SnR2, 1c), towards boron halides has been investigated and has
been shown to provide a facile pathway to ferrocene derivatives functionalized
with Lewis acidic boron centers. The boron halides RBX2 (R = Cl, Ph, fc; X = Cl, 
Br) (fc = Fe(eta-C5H4)2) lead to selective cleavage of the Si-Cp bonds in 1a and 
1b to give, depending on the reaction stoichiometry, functionalized mono- or
diferrocenylboranes RnB [(eta-C5H4)Fe(eta-C5H4SiMe2Cl)](3-n) (2a: R = Cl, n = 2; 
2b: R = Cl, n = 1; 2c: R = Ph, n = 1) and
RnB[(eta-C5H4)Fe(eta-C5H4SiMePhCl)](3-n) (2d: R = Cl, n = 2) in high yields.
Compounds 2a-d were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass
spectrometry, and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (for 2b). Most likely due
to steric constraints, a triferrocenylborane was not obtained even from the
reaction of BCl3 with an excess of 1a, whereas facile formation of the
diferrocenylphenylborane 2c from PhBCl2 and two equivalents of 1a was observed.
Selective hydrolysis of the B-Cl bonds of chlorodiferrocenylborane 2b in the
presence of trace amounts of water led to the silylated tetranuclear ferrocene
complex [(ClMe2Sifc)2B-O-B(fcSiMe2Cl)2] (3) without cleavage of the Si-Cl bonds. 
The structure of 3 was confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study. Studies of the
reactivity of the higher Group 14 homologue of 1a and 1b, the tin-bridged
[1]ferrocenophane 1c, revealed that facile addition of B-Cl bonds occurs across
the Sn-Cp bonds to yield the 1-stannyl-1'-borylferrocenes [(ClMes2Sn)fc(BClR)]
(4a: R = Cl; 4b: R = Ph; Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2). The new synthetic methodology can 
be extended to bifunctional Lewis acids such as the bis(boryl)ferrocene
1,1'-fc(BBr2)2, which affords the linear boron-bridged ferrocene trimer
1,1'-[fc[B(Br)fcSiMe2Br]2] 5 in 54% isolated yield. In order to incorporate the
functionalized ferrocenylboranes into polymer structures, compound 2c was reduced
with Li[BEt3H] to give the silicon-hydride functionalized species
[PhB[(eta-C5H4)Fe(eta-C5H4SiMe2H)]2] (6), which was then used as a capping
reagent in the transition metal catalyzed polymerization of 1a. This process
leads to the incorporation of the ferrocenylborane unit into the main chain of a 
poly(ferrocenylsilane) to afford [PhB-[(fcSiMe2)(n-1)fcSiMe2H]2] (7).

[formula: see text] The enantiomerically pure hydroxy sulfones (+)- and (-)-2
have been prepared from 1,2-epoxycyclohexane by a simple and practical procedure.
The acrylate esters of these alcohols undergo BCl3-catalyzed Diels-Alder
reactions with a variety of dienes at -78 to -55 degrees C in CH2Cl2 or C7H8 with
high dienophile face selectivity (Table 1). The chiral esters so formed are

Bcl3, an IkappaB protein, stimulates activating protein-1 transactivation and
cellular proliferation.

Na SY(1), Choi JE, Kim HJ, Jhun BH, Lee YC, Lee JW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Chonnam National University, Kwangju 500-757, South
Korea.

Bcl3, an IkappaB protein, was originally isolated as a putative proto-oncogene in
a subset of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Bcl3 was subsequently shown to 
associate tightly with and transactivate the NFkappaB p50 or p52 homodimer.
Herein, we show that Bcl3 stimulates the activating protein-1 (AP-1)
transactivation, either alone or in conjunction with transcription integrators
steroid receptor coactivator-1 and CREB-binding protein/p300. The C-terminal 158 
residues of Bcl3 exhibited an autonomous transactivation function and interacted 
with specific subregions of the AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos, CREB-binding
protein/p300, and steroid receptor coactivator-1, as demonstrated by the yeast
and mammalian two-hybrid tests as well as glutathione S-transferase pull-down
assays. In addition, anti-HA antibody co-precipitated c-Jun from HeLa cells
co-expressing c-Jun and HA-tagged Bcl3, consistent with the idea that Bcl3
directly associates with AP-1 in vivo. Furthermore, microinjection of Bcl3
expression vector into Rat-1 fibroblast cells significantly enhanced DNA
synthesis and expression of c-jun, one of the cellular target genes of AP-1.
These results suggest that Bcl3 may directly participate in the tumorigenesis
processes as a novel transcription coactivator of the mitogenic transcription
factor AP-1 in vivo.

Persistent activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in cultured rat hepatic stellate
cells involves the induction of potentially novel Rel-like factors and prolonged 
changes in the expression of IkappaB family proteins.

Rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC) cultured in serum-containing medium underwent a 
rapid (3-hour) classical induction of p50:p65 and p65:p65 nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-kappaB) dimers. Subsequent culturing was associated with prolonged expression
of active p50:p65 and persistent induction of a high-mobility NF-kappaB DNA
binding complex consisting of potentially novel Rel-like protein(s). Formation of
the latter complex was competed for by specific double-stranded oligonucleotides,
was up-regulated by treatment of HSCs with tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha), and was maintained at basal levels of expression by a soluble
HSC-derived factor. An NF-kappaB-responsive CAT reporter gene was highly active
in early cultured HSCs but was also trans-activated at a lower but significant
level in longer-term cultured cells and could be completely suppressed by
expression of dominant negative IkappaB-alpha. Physiological significance of the 
lower persistent NF-kappaB activities was also demonstrated by the ability of
long-term cultured HSCs to support the activity of the NF-kappaB-dependent human 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) promoter. Freshly isolated HSCs
expressed high levels of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta. Culture activation was
accompanied by a long-term reduction in levels of IkappaB-alpha with no
detectable expression in the nuclear fraction of cells, under these conditions
p50:p65 was detected in the nucleus. IkappaB-beta expression was transiently
reduced and, upon replenishment, was associated with appearance of a
lower-mobility IkappaB-beta antibody-reactive species. Bcl3 expression was absent
in freshly isolated HSC but was induced during culturing and became a persistent 
feature of the activated HSC. Inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity by
gliotoxin was associated with increased numbers of apoptotic cells. We suggest
that activation of NF-kappaB in cultured HSC is required for expression of
specific genes associated with the activated phenotype such as ICAM-1 and may be 
antiapoptotic for rat HSCs.

Interleukin-9 regulates NF-kappaB activity through BCL3 gene induction.

Richard M(1), Louahed J, Demoulin JB, Renauld JC.

Author information: 
(1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels Branch, Brussels, Belgium.

BCL3 encodes a protein with close homology to IkappaB proteins and interacts with
p50 NF-kappaB homodimers. However, the regulation and transcriptional activity of
BCL3 remain ill-defined. We observed here that interleukin-9 (IL-9) and IL-4, but
not IL-2 or IL-3, transcriptionally upregulated BCL3 expression in T cells and
mast cells. BCL3 induction by IL-9 was detected as soon as 4 hours after
stimulation and appeared to be dependent on the Jak/STAT pathway. IL-9
stimulation was associated with an increase in p50 homodimers DNA binding
activity, which was mimicked by stable BCL3 expression. This contrasts with tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent NF-kappaB activation, which occurs earlier,
involves p65/p50 dimers, and is dependent on IkappaB degradation. Moreover, IL-9 
stimulation or BCL3 transient transfection similarly inhibited NF-kappaB-mediated
transcription in response to TNF. Taken together, our observations show a new
regulatory pathway for the NF-kappaB transcription factors through STAT-dependent
upregulation of BCL3 gene expression.

cardia adenocarcinomas.

Incidence rates have risen rapidly for esophageal and gastric cardia
adenocarcinomas. These cancers, arising at and around the gastroesophageal
junction (GEJ), share a poor prognosis. In contrast, there is no consensus with
respect to clinical staging resulting in possible adverse effects on treatment
and survival. The goal of this study was to provide more insight into the genetic
changes underlying esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas. We have used
comparative genomic hybridization for a genetic analysis of 28 adenocarcinomas of
the GEJ. Eleven tumors were localized in the distal esophagus and related to
Barrett's esophagus, and 10 tumors were situated in the gastric cardia. The
remaining seven tumors were located at the junction and could not be classified
as either Barrett-related, or gastric cardia. We found alterations in all 28
neoplasms. Gains and losses were distinguished in comparable numbers. Frequent
loss (> or = 25% of all tumors) was detected, in decreasing order of frequency,
on 4pq (54%), 14q (46%), 18q (43%), 5q (36%), 16q (36%), 9p (29%), 17p (29%), and
21q (29%). Frequent gain (> or = 25% of all tumors) was observed, in decreasing
order of frequency, on 20pq (86%), 8q (79%), 7p (61%), 13q (46%), 12q (39%), 15q 
(39%), 1q (36%), 3q (32%), 5p (32%), 6p (32%), 19q (32%), Xpq (32%), 17q (29%),
and 18p (25%). Nearly all patients were male, and loss of chromosome Y was
frequently noted (64%). Recurrent high-level amplifications (> 10% of all tumors)
were seen at 8q23-24.1, 15q25, 17q12-21, and 19q13.1. Minimal overlapping regions
could be determined at multiple locations (candidate genes are in parentheses):
minimal regions of overlap for deletions were assigned to 3p14 (FHIT, RCA1),
5q14-21 (APC, MCC), 9p21 (MTS1/CDKN2), 14q31-32.1 (TSHR), 16q23, 18q21 (DCC, P15)
and 21q21. Minimal overlapping amplified sites could be seen at 5p14 (MLVI2),
6p12-21.1 (NRASL3), 7p12 (EGFR), 8q23-24.1 (MYC), 12q21.1, 15q25 (IGF1R),
17q12-21 (ERBB2/HER2-neu), 19q13.1 (TGFB1, BCL3, AKT2), 20p12 (PCNA), 20q12-13
(MYBL2, PTPN1), and Xq25. The distribution of the imbalances revealed similar
genetic patterns in the three GEJ tumor groups. However, loss of 14q31-32.1
occurred significantly more frequent in Barrett-related adenocarcinomas of the
distal esophagus, than in gastric cardia cancers (P = 0.02). The unclassified,
"pure junction" group displayed an intermediate position, suggesting that these
may be in part gastric cardia tumors, whereas the others may be related to
(short-segment) Barrett's esophagus. In conclusion, this study has, fist,
provided a detailed comparative genomic hybridization-map of GEJ adenocarcinomas 
documenting new genetic changes, as well as candidate genes involved. Second,
genetic divergence was revealed in this poorly understood group of cancers.

Infrared and Microwave Spectra and Force Field of DBO: The Coriolis Interaction
between the nu1 and nu2 + nu3 States.

The nu1 and nu3 bands of D11BO and the nu1 band of D10BO were observed by using
an infrared diode laser spectrometer. The DBO molecule was generated by an ac
discharge in a mixture of BCl3, D2, O2, and He. As inferred previously, a strong 
Coriolis interaction was in fact found to take place between the nu1 and nu2 +
nu3 states, and an analysis of the observed nu1 spectra, which explicitly took
into account this Coriolis interaction, predicted the pure rotational transition 
frequencies of DBO in the nu1 state. Pure rotational lines were then detected by 
microwave spectroscopy, confirming the validity of the infrared assignment. In
the microwave experiment DBO molecules were generated by a discharge in a mixture
of B2D6 and O2. The three fundamental bands and a hot band of D11BO, as well as
the nu1 and nu3 bands of D10BO, were subsequently recorded in emission with a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. DBO molecules were generated by the
reaction of D2 with HBO at temperatures above 800 degreesC in a ceramic tube
furnace. All of the observed spectra were simultaneously subjected to a
least-squares analysis to obtain molecular parameters in the ground, nu1, nu2,
nu3, and nu2 + nu3 states. The results thus obtained improved the force field and
molecular structure of the HBO/DBO molecules reported in a previous study (Y.
Kawashima, Y. Endo, and E. Hirota, 1989, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 133, 116-127).

Rotational spectra of the unstable molecules FBO, ClBO, and FBS have been
measured in the 8-26 GHz frequency range using a pulsed jet cavity Fourier
transform microwave spectrometer. The samples were prepared by passing electric
discharges through mixtures of O2/BF3, O2/BCl3, or OCS/BF3, respectively,
entrained in Ne. Hyperfine structures in the observed transitions have been
resolved and analyzed in terms of nuclear quadrupole, spin-rotation, and
spin-spin interactions. The quadrupole and spin-rotation coupling constants have 
been used to show that the electronic environment surrounding the boron nucleus
of all three species is very similar. The spin-rotation constants have been used 
to determine, for the first time, experimental average shieldings of the Cl, F,
and B nuclei of these molecules. Ab initio values for the nuclear shielding
parameters have been calculated for comparison. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

Bcl3, an IkappaB protein, as a novel transcription coactivator of the retinoid X 
receptor.

Na SY(1), Choi HS, Kim JW, Na DS, Lee JW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Chonnam National University, Kwangju 500-757, Korea.

We have recently shown that the IkappaB protein IkappaBbeta interacted with the
retinoid X receptor (RXR) and inhibited the 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA)-dependent
transactivations (Na, S.-Y., Kim, H.-J., Lee, S.-K., Choi, H.-S., Na, D. S., Lee,
M.-O., Chung, M., Moore, D. D., and Lee, J. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 6,
3212-3215). Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein Bcl3 also interacts
with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and glutathione S-transferase
pull-down assays. The Bcl3 interaction involved two distinct subregions of RXR,
i.e. constitutive interactions of the N-terminal ABC domains and
9-cis-RA-dependent interactions of the C-terminal DEF domains. In contrast to
IkappaBbeta, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR. Bcl3 specifically 
interacted with the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA but not
with TFIIEalpha in the GST pull-down assays. TBP and TFIIA, however, were not
able to interact with IkappaBbeta. Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the
9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions
of IkappaBbeta. In addition, coexpression of SRC-1 but not p300 further
stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations
of RXR. These results suggest that distinct IkappaB proteins differentially
modulate the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR in vivo.

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (OFC) is a common birth
defect that has genetic bases. The nature of the genetic contribution is still to
be clarified; however, some chromosome regions and candidate genes have been
proposed for this malformation. We examined linkage between BCL3, a
proto-oncogene located in 19q13.2, and OFC in a sample composed of 40 multiplex
pedigrees using both nonparametric and parametric methods. The affected pedigree 
member statistics and the transmission disequilibrium test supported a role for
BCL3 in causing OFC, while no evidence of linkage or genetic heterogeneity was
found with the lod score method.

Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), and cleft palate (CP) are most
common congenital malformation conditions. Prognosis mainly rests on the
possibility of associated symptoms, since more than a hundred recognised
Mendelian disorders involve this orofacial defect (thereby defining syndromic
CL/P, or CP). Multiplex non-syndromic CL/P, or CP families indicate that genetic 
factors are likely involved in causation. Inheritance is generally regarded as
multigenic, allelic variation at different loci (TGF alpha, TGF beta 3, RARA)
determining a fraction of the genetic risk, as demonstrated by association or
transmission/disequilibrium non-parametric tests. Some pedigrees are however
clearly monogenic, consistent with either autosomal dominant or recessive
inheritance. X-linked recessive CP (with or without ankyloglossia) is an
additional possibility. Significant linkage to 6p23 (EDN1) or 19q13 (BCL3) could 
be achieved using parametric models with reduced penetrance. Environmental
exposures were also demonstrated to interfere with lip and/or palatal formation
when present during the first trimester of pregnancy. Whereas ethanol, retinoids 
or folate antagonists are clearly teratogenic, indictment of more common
exposures such as caffeine is merely tentative. The development of animal models 
allowed to confirm the genetic bases of CL/P, or CP, exemplify the role of
teratogens, and study the interaction of nature and nurture.

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and nonsyndromic cleft
palate only (CPO) are common congenital anomalies with significant medical,
psychological, social, and economic ramifications. Both CL/P and CPO are examples
of complex genetic traits. There exists sufficient evidence to hypothesize that
disease loci for CL/P and CPO can be identified by a candidate-gene
linkage-disequilibrium (LD) strategy. Candidate genes for clefting, including
TGFA, BCL3, DLX2, MSX1, and TGFB3, were screened for LD with either CL/P or CPO
in a predominantly Caucasian population, with both case-control- and
nuclear-family-based approaches. Previously reported LD for TGFA with both CL/P
and CPO could not be confirmed, except in CL/P patients with a positive family
history. Also, in contrast to previous studies, no LD was found between BCL3 and 
either CL/P or CPO. Significant LD was found between CL/P and both MSX1 and TGFB3
and between CPO and MSX1, suggesting that these genes are involved in the
pathogenesis of clefting. In addition, a mutation search in the genes DLX2, MSX1,
and TGFB3 was performed in 69 CPO patients and in a subset of the CL/P patients. 
No common mutations were found in the coding regions of these genes; however,
several rare variants of MSX1 and TGFB3 were found that may alter the latters'
normal function. These results form the basis for future research, including (a) 
mutation searches in the MSX1 and TGFB3 genes in Caucasian CL/P patients and (b) 
extension of the search for MSX1 mutations in CPO patients to the noncoding
regions.

Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and altered immunoglobulin production in BCL3
transgenic mice.

Ong ST(1), Hackbarth ML, Degenstein LC, Baunoch DA, Anastasi J, McKeithan TW.

Author information: 
(1)University of Chicago, Department of Medicine, Illinois 60637, USA.

The candidate proto-oncogene BCL3 was isolated through its involvement in the
t(14;19) found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell neoplasms. As a
member of the I kappaB family, BCL3 plays a role in the immune response by
interactions with the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. In order to
study the role of BCL3 overexpression in lymphoid malignancies, we generated five
lines of E mu-BCL3 transgenic mice. Transgenic animals develop normally but show 
splenomegaly and an accumulation of mature B cells in lymph nodes, bone marrow
and peritoneal cavity. A hyperresponsive immune system is suggested by the
follicular hyperplasia and plasmacytosis in lymph nodes of unimmunized animals,
increased incidence of antibodies to self-antigens, and a heightened response to 
cross-linking of surface IgM. Statistically significant decreases in serum IgM
and IgG3, but an increase in IgG1 and IgA were also observed. No lymphoid
neoplasms have been identified in transgenic animals. The expansion of B cells in
vivo is consistent with the overexpression of BCL3 as being one step in the
multi-step process of leukemogenesis. The phenotype also suggests that BCL3 plays
a part in B cell proliferation and isotype switching.

Determination of trace 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in fresh produce by gas
chromatography with boron trichloride/2-chloroethanol derivatization.

Ting KC(1), Kho PK.

Author information: 
(1)State of California, Department of Food and Agriculture, Anaheim, CA 92801,
USA.

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) residues in fresh produce is officially
analyzed as its methyl ester form by gas chromatography with electron capture
detection (GC-ECD). Because of safety concerns with diazomethane, the reagent
used to form methyl esters, a less toxic and dangerous reagent,
BCl3/2-chloroethanol, was considered. With this alternative reagent, the
detecting product is a 2-chloroethyl ester. Compared with the methylester, the
2-chloroethylester has a longer retention time and a better signal-to-noise ratio
for trace level analysis by GC-ECD. However, the reagent produces too many
unwanted background peaks. If peak retention time is the only information
available to identify the residue in case of litigation, the presence of too much
background noise increases the ambiguity of identification. Therefore,
confirmation by interpretation of the mass spectrum and determination of the
compound structure is necessary to ensure the validity of the method. Ten
commodities were fortified with 2,4-D at 0.1 ppm. Recoveries of 2-chloroethyl
esters and methyl esters were 91 and 92%, respectively. The method is safe,
simple, and robust.

Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of conformationally constrained
aci-reductone mimics of arachidonic acid.

An efficient and convergent synthesis has been developed for the production of
3,4-dihydroxy-5-[4-(2-((2Z)-hexenyl)phenyl)-3-(1Z)-but enyl]-2 (5H)-furanone
(12d). This hydrophobic antioxidant is a stable conformationally constrained
mimic of arachidonic acid (AA) (1) and its respective aci-reductone analogue (2).
Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling of 5-(3-butynyl)-3,4-dihydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (7) 
with 2-((2Z)-hexenyl)iodobenzene (8d) followed by Lindlar catalyzed hydrogenation
produces 12d. Butynyl intermediate 7 is prepared from
2-(benzyloxy)-5-deoxyascorbic acid (15) by iodination (I2, PPh3, Imd), iodo
substitution with lithium acetylide ethylenediamine complex (LiAEDA, HMPA, -5
degrees C), and benzyl group cleavage (Ac2O, Pyr, BCl3). The utility of this
synthetic method was demonstrated by the synthesis of analogues 10e-k. Biological
testing revealed that certain of these antioxidants inhibit both cyclooxygenase
(COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) with comparable efficacy as reported for aspirin 
and zileuton, respectively. The antioxidant activity of these aci-reductones,
measured as a function of their inhibitory effect on CCl4-induced lipid
peroxidation of hepatic microsomes, exceeds that produced by alpha-tocopherol.
Synthetic routes and initial structure-activity relationships (SAR) for these
novel mixed functioning antioxidants are presented.

Diverse effects of BCL3 phosphorylation on its modulation of NF-kappaB p52
homodimer binding to DNA.

Bundy DL(1), McKeithan TW.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Pathology and of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, University of
Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.

IkappaB proteins control the subcellular localization and DNA binding activity of
NF-kappaB transcription factors. BCL3 is a nuclear IkappaB that can inhibit or
enhance the binding of NF-kappaB p50 or p52 homodimers to consensus DNA-binding
(kappaB) sequences or form a kappaB-binding complex with homodimers. To study
BCL3 function, we have used gel shift analysis and tagged protein and tagged DNA 
coprecipitation analyses. Our results show that at intermediate ratios of BCL3 to
p52 all observed phosphoforms of BCL3 are able to form a kappaB-binding complex
with p52 homodimers. At low BCL3/p52 ratios, BCL3 increases the rate of p52
homodimer binding to kappaB sites in the presence of nonconsensus DNA and
dissociates from the complex. At high BCL3/p52 ratios, BCL3 forms a higher order 
inhibitory complex with p52 homodimers. All of these effects depend on BCL3
phosphorylation and relative concentration. These results indicate that BCL3
phosphorylation may affect its regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in
vivo.

Application of transmission disequilibrium tests to nonsyndromic oral clefts:
including candidate genes and environmental exposures in the models.

Extensive epidemiological and genetic studies of the cause of oral clefts have
demonstrated strong familial aggregation but have failed to yield definitive
evidence of any single genetic mechanism. We used the transmission/disequilibrium
test (TDT) to investigate the relationship between oral clefts and markers
associated with five candidate genes by utilizing 160 parent-offspring trios.
Conditional logistic regression models extended the TDT to include covariates as 
effect modifiers, thus permitting tests for gene-environment interactions. For
four of these candidates [transforming growth factor alpha (TGFA), transforming
growth factor beta 3 (TGFB3), retinoic acid receptor (RARA), and the
proto-oncogene BCL3], we detected modestly elevated odds ratios for the
transmission of one marker allele to cleft probands when all the trios were
analyzed together. These odds ratios increased when information on type of cleft,
race, family history, or maternal smoking were incorporated as effect modifiers. 
We detected significant interaction between maternal smoking and the transmission
of alleles for markers near TGFA and TGFB3; excess transmission of allele 3 at
BCL3 was most significant among cleft lip probands; and the odds ratios for
transmission of alleles at D19S178 and THRA1 were significant when ethnic group
was included in the model. We suggest that utilizing an analytical strategy that 
allows for stratification of data and incorporating environmental effects into a 
single analysis may be more effective for detecting genes of small effect.

BCL3 rearrangements and t(14;19) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell
malignancies: a molecular and cytogenetic study.

The t(14;19)(q32.3;q13.1) is a recurring translocation found in the neoplastic
cells of some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or other
B-lymphocytic neoplasms. We previously cloned the translocation breakpoint
junctions present in the leukemic cells from three such patients and identified a
gene, BCL3, whose transcription is increased as a result of the translocation. In
the present paper, we describe three additional patients with the t(14;19), one
with lymphoma and two with CLL, and report the cloning and sequencing of the
breakpoint junction in one of these patients as well as in a previously reported 
patient. We and others have found that the breakpoints on chromosome 14, with one
exception, fall within the switch region upstream of the immunoglobulin heavy
chain C alpha 1 or C alpha 2 sequences. Several of the breaks within chromosome
19 fall immediately upstream of the BCL3 gene, but several others are more than
16 kb 5' of the gene. Most patients with CLL and the t(14;19) also show trisomy
12.

Germline configuration of nfkb2, c-rel and bcl3 in childhood acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL).

The well-known family of NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors is a central
regulator of growth, differentiation and apoptosis in hematopoietic cell
lineages. There is increasing evidence for their role in malignant
transformation, especially in lymphomas. To study the possible involvement of
NF-kappaB/Rel genes in the development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL), DNA samples from 140 patients were examined by Southern blot analysis. All
samples revealed germline configuration of nfkb2, c-rel, and bcl3, indicating
that structural alterations of these members of the NF-kappaB/Rel family are
extremely rare, if existing at all in childhood ALL.

To establish a rapid and sensitive method to detect neoplastic cells carrying a
specific chromosomal translocation in B-cell lymphoma/leukemia, we have developed
a novel strategy based on long distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR)
amplification. Genomic DNA were extracted from tumor cells carrying a
t(14;19)(q32;q13), a t(8;14)(q24;q32), a t(3;22)(q27;q11), a t(2;3)(p12;q27), and
a t(3;14)(q27;q32). Oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to be
complementary to exons or flanking sequences of the BCL3, c-MYC and BCL6
oncogenes, and to constant region genes of the IG genes. LD-PCR with a newly
available Taq polymerase for longer product synthesis successfully amplified
fragments representing BCL3/C alpha junctional sequences for t(14;19); c-MYC/C
mu, c-MYC/C gamma and c-MYC/C alpha for t(8;14); BCL6/C lambda for t(3;22);
BCL6/C kappa for t(2;3); 5'-BCL6/C mu and 5'-BCL6/C gamma for t(3;14),
respectively. The sizes of the amplified fragments were varied from 1.8 kb to 12 
kb, which were specific to each material. Present study provides a useful tool
for diagnosis and subsequent management of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia characterized
with specific chromosomal translocation.

PURPOSE: To quantify the proportion of heart volumes that received at least 25 Gy
with tangential photon fields in patients with left-sided stage I (T1 NOMO)
breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The dose planning of 100 consecutive patients was
reviewed. All were irradiated with tangential photon fields that covered the left
breast only. A three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT)-based dose planning
was made for each patient. The prescribed dose to the tumor was 50 Gy. For each
patient, the proportion of the heart included in the 50% isodose was determined
from the cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH). The same volume determination
was made for the left-sided breast cancer patients treated with tangential fields
during the first Stockholm Breast Cancer Trial.
RESULTS: The mean irradiated heart volume that received at least 25 Gy was 5.7%
(SD = 4.5%) for the whole group and 11.9% (SD = 3.7%) in those with the highest
volumes. The mean irradiated heart volume included in the 50% isodose for
patients in the Stockholm Trial was 25% (SD = 11.9%).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the majority of patients with left-sided T1NOMO breast
cancer did not receive irradiation to substantial heart volumes. However, in 6%
of all studied patients, the proportion of irradiated heart volume was close to
the irradiated heart volumes with one of the treatment techniques used in the
Stockholm Trial for patients with left-sided tumors. That technique has been
associated with significantly increased cardiac mortality during long-term
follow-up evaluation in a previous study. The CT-based three-dimensional
treatment-planning system (TMS) represents a valuable tool in identifying such
patients; thus, treatment may be conformed to reduce the irradiated heart volume.

Genes and chromosomes in chronic B-cell leukemia.

Crossen PE(1).

Author information: 
(1)Cytogenetic and Molecular Oncology Unit, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.

Cytogenetic analysis of patients with chronic B-cell leukemia (B-CLL) indicates
that 50% have chromosome abnormalities, while fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) and molecular techniques reveal an even higher incidence. Trisomy 12 and
deletions or translocation of chromosome 13q14 are the most common abnormalities,
but in neither case has the gene or genes involved in the abnormalities been
identified. Combined FISH and immunophenotyping studies suggest that both
abnormalities are secondary events in B-CLL. Other recurring chromosome
abnormalities include 6q-, 11q- and 12p-, but the genes involved in these
abnormalities have not been identified. Involvement of the BCL1, BCL2, and BCL3
genes has been reported, but the numbers are low and the cases tend to be
atypical. Trisomy 12 in association with complex karyotypic abnormalities is
associated with a poor prognosis, and FISH studies show a strong correlation
between trisomy 12, atypical morphology, and advanced disease. Ten to 15% of
patients have mutations of p53 which is associated with advanced disease,
resistance to treatment, and poor survival.

t(14;19)/BCL3 rearrangements in lymphoproliferative disorders: a review of 23
cases.

Belgium.

The t(14;19)(q32.3;q13.2) is a rare but recurrent translocation found in patients
with B-cell malignancies, mainly in chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.
When occurring in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), atypical lymphocyte
morphology and immunophenotype have been reported. A high proportion of patients 
with CLL and t(14;19) are aged less than 40 years. t(14;19) is often associated
with rapidly progressive disease, and overall prognosis is poor compared to the
expected survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and low-grade B-cell lymphoma. 
t(14;19) is rarely the sole cytogenetic aberration. Trisomy 12 is the most
frequent associated abnormality, and is observed in 50% of cases. t(14;19)
involves the BCL3 gene, which is located at the breakpoint on chromosome 19 and
is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus on chromosome 14
(often in the switch alpha region) in a "head-to-head" configuration. The
translocation does not interrupt the transcriptional integrity of BCL3, but is
associated with overexpression of this gene, which encodes an I kappa B-like
protein and modulates the activity of the NF-kappa B transcription factors. The
genes affected by overexpression of BCL3 remain to be identified.

Twelve patients with diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma/leukemia and
del[7q] were studied for their clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular
characteristics. Eleven patients were classified as small cell lymphoma whereas
one had a diffuse large cell lymphoma. Lymphoplasmacytic features were observed
in six out of eleven small cell lymphomas. Morphologically and immunologically
these small cell lymphomas could be classified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(typical or atypical; 4 cases), marginal zone lymphoma (splenic lymphoma with
villous lymphocytes; 1 case), mantle cell lymphoma (2 cases), or nonspecified,
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (4 cases). Eleven of twelve patients presented with
peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement. Two of twelve cases showed del[7q] 
as the sole anomaly. Two different types of deletions were present: ten cases had
del(7)(q21q31) and two cases had del(7)(q31q34). Cases that could be molecularly 
investigated did not show any involvement of BCL2, BCL3, or BCL6, and only one
case had BCL1 rearrangement. The data indicate that del(7q) is associated with a 
subset of mature small B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders of which some but not
all show lymphoplasmatic features.

It has been reported that BCL3 on chromosome 19q, or a nearby gene, may play a
role in the etiology of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate
(NSCL/P) in some families. We tested 30 USA and 11 Mexican multiplex NSCL/P
families for four markers on chromosome 19q: D19S178, APOC2/AC1, APOC2/007, and
BCL3. While likelihood-based linkage analysis failed to show significant evidence
of linkage, the transmission disequilibrium test indicated highly significant
deviation from independent assortment of allele 3 at the BCL3 marker in both data
sets (USA:P = 0.001; Mexican: P = 0.018; both combined: P < 0.001) and for allele
13 of the D19S178 marker in the Mexican data set (P = 0.004). These results
support an association, possibly due to linkage disequilibrium, between
chromosome 19 markers and a putative NSCL/P locus.

Fourier Transform Infrared Emission Spectroscopy of the b1Pi-a1Sigma+ System of
BN

Ram RS(1), Bernath PF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, 85721

The emission spectrum of BN has been investigated in the 1800-9000 cm-1 region
using a Fourier transform spectrometer. BN was formed in a microwave discharge of
He with a trace of BCl3 and N2. The bands observed in the 3000-7800 cm-1 interval
have been assigned as the b1Pi-a1Sigma+ transition, with the 0-0 band at
3513.99040(43) cm-1. This transition is analogous to the A1Piu-X1Sigma+g
(Phillips) system of the isoelectronic C2 molecule. The rotational analysis of
the 0-0, 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 2-0, 3-1, 4-2, and 4-1 bands has been obtained and
the molecular constants for the b1Pi and a1Sigma+ states have been determined. A 
local perturbation has been observed in the v = 1 vibrational level of the b1Pi
state near J = 18 caused by the interaction with the v = 3 vibrational level of
the a1Sigma+ state. The principal equilibrium constants for the a1Sigma+ state
are: omegae = 1705.4032(11) cm-1, omegaexe = 10.55338(52) cm-1, Be =
1.683771(10), alphae = 0.013857(16) cm-1, and re = 1.2745081(37) A. Although the 
b1Pi-a1Sigma+ transition has recently been seen in emission from boron nitride
trapped in solid neon matrices [J. Chem. Phys. 104, 3143-3146 (1996)], our work
represents the first observation of this transition of BN in the gas phase.

Molecular basis of familial cleft lip and palate.

Hibbert SA(1), Field JK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Dental Sciences, University of Liverpool, UK.

Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is one of the commonest congenital malformations and
although the aetiology is still very unclear, a familial genetic component is
considered to be an important factor in certain individuals. Molecular biology
techniques are being used to identify the genes involved and this paper reviews
current knowledge and the advances that have already been made. Recent evidence
suggests a potential major gene on 6p, and a modifying role for transforming
growth factor alpha (TGFA). Moreover retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) (17q),
MSXI (4p), 4q and BCL3 (19q) could all be implicated in certain CLP families. In 
addition, the potential modifying role of various genes with the environment are 
considered to be important areas of research in the future. The identification of
a genetic locus associated with this disease would be an important advance in CLP
genetic counselling and lead to a better understanding of the genetic basis of
CLP.

We investigated mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in B-cell lymphoid
neoplasms with reference to oncogene rearrangements associated with specific
chromosomal translocations. These included 15 patients with a BCL1/PRAD1 gene
rearrangement and/or PRAD1 overexpression, 45 with a BCL2 rearrangement, 2 with a
BCL3 rearrangement, 24 with a BCL6 rearrangement, and 6 with both BCL2 and BCL6
rearrangements. Thirty-six patients lacked detectable oncogene rearrangements.
Genomic DNA was isolated from involved tissues or leukemic cells obtained at
diagnosis and/or at relapse, and established cell lines. Polymerase chain
reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct
sequencing were performed to analyze abnormalities of the p53 gene. We detected
p53 gene alterations in 18 of 128 patients, representing 21 of the total 151
materials analyzed. In the total of 66 patients with an oncogene rearrangement
studied at diagnosis, only one had a mutation; however, 6 of 37 patients studied 
at relapse showed p53 mutations. Sequential analysis revealed that the p53
mutation was closely associated with transformation from follicular lymphoma to
large cell lymphoma, exclusively in BCL2-positive lymphoma cases. Two of 13
mutations observed in oncogene rearrangement-positive cases and cell lines were
transitions at CpG dinucleotides. In contrast, the relationship between p53
mutations and clinical behavior in oncogene rearrangement-negative cases was
variable; 5 patients including one with indolent follicular lymphoma were
positive for p53 mutation at initial presentation, and 2 of the 5 showed
prolonged disease-free survival. Our findings suggest that p53 alteration
exhibits diverse functions in the development and progression of B-cell tumors
related to the presence or absence of oncogene rearrangement, and that
chemotherapy-related influences may be involved in the occurrence of
progression-associated p53 mutations.

Junctional sequences created by chromosomal translocations in mature B-cell
neoplasms, which involve immunoglobulin gene loci (IG) and putative
proto-oncogenes on reciprocal partner chromosomes, are unique to neoplastic cells
characterized by particular histological and immunological phenotypes. To
establish a rapid and sensitive method to detect neoplastic cells carrying a
specific chromosomal translocation, we have developed a novel strategy based on
long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) amplification. Genomic DNA was
extracted from tumor cells carrying t(14;19)(q32;q13), t(8;14)(q24;q32),
t(3;22)(q27;q11), t(2;3)(p12;q27), or t(3;14)(q27;q32). Thirty-two to 35-mer
oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to be complementary to exons or
flanking sequences of the BCL3, c-MYC and BCL6 oncogenes, and to IG constant
region genes. LD-PCR with a newly available Taq polymerase for longer product
synthesis successfully amplified fragments representing BCL3/C alpha junctional
sequences for t(14;19); c-MYC/C mu, c-MYC/C gamma, and c-MYC/C alpha for t(8;14);
BCL6/C lambda for t(3;22); BCL6/C kappa for t(2;3); 5'-BCL6/C mu, and 5'-BCL6/C
gamma for t(3;14). In Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia, all materials in which c-MYC
rearrangements were detectable by conventional Southern blot hybridization showed
positive LD-PCR amplification. The sizes of the amplified fragments varied from
1.8 kb to 12 kb, and these were specific to each material. Serial dilution of
tumor cells or DNA in negative materials demonstrated a single band on agarose
gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide at a level of sensitivity of
10(-3), and hybridization with radioactive probe improved the level by one order 
of magnitude (1 cell in 10(4)), indicating that this LD-PCR approach is a
sensitive technique capable of detecting minimal residual disease. Thus, the
present study provided a useful tool for diagnosis and subsequent management of
B-cell neoplasms characterized by specific chromosomal translocations.

Translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13) is a rare but recurrent abnormality in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and small cell lymphoma. It has been associated with
rearrangements of the BCL3 gene, which is located at the breakpoint on chromosome
19 and is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 as 
a result of the translocation. This results in transcriptional up-regulation of
the BCL3 gene, which encodes a transcription coactivator, an I-kappa B protein,
probably contributing to disease progression. We found, among 4,487 cytogenetic
analyses of lymphoproliferative disorders, six cases with a t(14;19)(q32;q13),
five of which showed the classical t(14;19)(q32;q13) and one of which showed a
three-way translocation t(7;19;14)(q21;q13;q32). The 14;19 translocation never
occurred as a single abnormality; additional aberrations included trisomy 12 and 
several structural abnormalities. The cytogenetic examination was supplemented by
molecular analysis using available probes for the BCL3 locus (p alpha 1.4P and p 
alpha 5B) in 1,150 of the 4,487 patients. Rearrangements of BCL3 could be
detected in five cases, all of which had the classical t(14;19). In the case with
t(7;19;14), the suspected BCL3 involvement could only be confirmed using
long-range restriction mapping, indicating that, with the usually available BCL3 
probes, rearrangements of this locus may be missed.

Clinical, histologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic data of 31 patients with
extranodal, nodal, and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBCL) are
presented. Despite these variable clinical manifestations, a similar spectrum of 
morphologic features as well as distinctive immunophenotypic findings were noted.
In all cases, a monotypic B-cell proliferation consistently negative for CD5,
CD10, and CD23 was found expanding the marginal zone of the B follicle with and
without colonization of the follicle centers. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities
were detected in 23 of the 31 patients. Recurrent aberrations included whole or
partial trisomy 3 (18 cases), trisomy 18 (9 cases), and structural rearrangements
of chromosome 1 with breakpoints in 1q21 (9 cases) or 1p34 (6 cases), all of
which were seen in extranodal, nodal, as well as splenic MZBCL. Abnormalities of 
the additional chromosome 3, such as +del(3)(p13),+i(3)(q10), or structural
changes involving the distal part of the long arm, were evident in 9 of the 18
cases. All recurrent abnormalities were found in MZBCL more frequently than in
other histologic entities of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). None of the
known lymphoma-associated chromosomal changes or rearrangements of the BCL1,
BCL2, BCL3, BCL6, and CMYC genes were detected. We conclude that MZBCL represent 
a distinct entity of B-NHL with characteristic morphologic and immunophenotypic
features and particular chromosomal abnormalities, and that a close histogenetic 
relationship between extranodal, nodal, and splenic MZBCL is likely, although the
clinical presentation may vary.

Structure and evolution of the human IKBA gene.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599, USA.

IkappaBalpha belongs to a gene family whose members are characterized by their
6-7 Ankyrin repeats, which allow them to interact with members of the Rel family 
of transcription factors. We have sequenced a human IkappaBalpha genomic clone to
determine its gene structure. The human IkappaBalpha gene (IKBA) has six exons
and five introns that span approximately 3.5 kb. This genomic organization is
similar to that of other members of the Ankyrin gene family. The human IKBA gene 
shares similar intron/exon boundaries with the human BCL3 and NFKB2 genes, which 
is consistent with their conserved Ankyrin repeats. To examine further the
evolutionary relationship between human IkappaBalpha and other members of its
gene family, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. Although the resulting
phylogenetic tree does not identify a common ancestor of the IkappaBalpha and
other members of its gene family, it indicates that this family diverges into two
groups based on structure and function.

Toxicological investigations in the semiconductor industry: IV. Studies on the
subchronic oral toxicity and genotoxicity of vacuum pump oils contaminated by
waste products from aluminum plasma etching processes.

Dry etching processes in semiconductor manufacturing use ionized gases in closed 
reactors at pressures below 1 torr. Vacuum pump systems that service the reaction
chambers are potential sources of exposure to complex mixtures of inorganic and
organic compounds. These mixtures consist of unused process gases and process
by-products that condense and accumulate in the vacuum pump oils. To evaluate
potential hazards of dry etch vacuum equipment, a contaminated vacuum pump oil
sample from a BCl3/Cl2 etching process was analyzed. The waste oil was
administered by gavage for 14 or 28 days to male and female Wistar rats. Neither 
death nor behavioral changes occurred after subchronic treatment or during a
14-day posttreatment period. Only slight effects on body weights, clinical
chemistry, and hematology data were seen in the exposed animals, although the
livers of all waste oil-exposed rats of both sexes showed remarkable hypertrophic
degenerations. Genotoxicological investigations were performed through the Ames
assay (Salmonella assay) and the Micronucleus assay. The contaminated oil sample 
caused clear genotoxic effects in both test systems.

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is a common
craniofacial developmental defect. Recent segregation analyses have suggested
that major genes play a role in the etiology of CL/P. Linkage to 22 candidate
genes was tested in 11 multigenerational families with CL/P, and 21 of these
candidates were excluded. APOC2, 19q13.1, which is linked to the proto-oncogene
BCL3, gave suggestive evidence for linkage to CL/P. The study was expanded to
include a total of 39 multigenerational CL/P families. Linkage was tested in all 
families, using an anonymous marker, D19S178, and intragenic markers in BCL3 and 
APOC2. Linkage was tested under two models, autosomal dominant with reduced
penetrance and affecteds only. Homogeneity testing on the two-point data gave
evidence of heterogeneity at APOC2 under the affecteds-only model. Both models
showed evidence of heterogeneity, with 43% of families linked at zero
recombination to BCL3 when marker data from BCL3 and APOC2 were included. A
maximum multipoint LOD score of 7.00 at BCL3 was found among the 17 families that
had posterior probabilities > = 50% in favor of linkage. The transmission
disequilibrium test provided additional evidence for linkage with the 3 allele of
BCL3 more often transmitted to affected children. These results suggest that
BCL3, or a nearby gene, plays a role in the etiology of CL/P in some families.

The major ether-type lipid structures of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (ATCC33909)
were composed of caldarchaeol and calditoglycerocaldarchaeol. However, the
characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
showed that the structure of calditol in calditoglycerocaldarchaeol is not
nonitol, 2-(1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroxyhexane, but
2-hydroxymethyl-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)2,3,4,5-cyclopentanetet raol with an
ether linkage in the molecule. Such an intermolecular ether linkage was resistant
to BCl3 treatment, but nonresistant to 57% HI degradation treatment conducted at 
100 degrees C for 60 h, producing 2-hydroxymethyl-1,2,3,4,5-cyclopentanepentaol
from calditol as reaction product. Further, it was confirmed that the structure
of calditol is essentially a derivative of glycerol, and hydrocarbon chains were 
conjugated to the glycerol-like site in the structure. The calditol with an ether
linkage in the molecule suggested an important role regarding the properties of
heat-resistance and acid-resistance observed in Sulfolobales.

Specific inhibition of RelB/p52 transcriptional activity by the C-terminal domain
of p100.

Institute, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.

The Rel/NF-kappa B family transcriptional factors plays an important role in the 
regulation of immune and acute phase responses. The activity of Rel/NF-kappa B
complexes is regulated by their interactions with members of the I kappa B family
of inhibitors. We have previously shown that the RelB/p52 heterodimer is not
effectively inhibited by any of the known I kappa B molecules: I kappa B alpha, I
kappa B gamma and Bcl3. Here we report that the C-terminal domain of p100 (the
putative I kappa B delta) functions as a strong inhibitor of RelB/p52
transcriptional activity. In vivo interaction with I kappa B delta leads to the
cytoplasmic retention and decreased DNA binding activity of RelB/p52 complexes.
Thus, I kappa B delta is the only I kappa B molecule able to efficiently modulate
the activity of RelB/p52 heterodimer. In Daudi cells, a 46 kD protein, probably
representing the C-terminal product of the proteolytic processing of p100,
remains associated with Rel/NF-kappa B complexes and might have a transient
regulatory function. Our results indicate a specific role for the putative I
kappa B delta and suggest a possible mechanism of how the truncation of the
ankyrin domain of p100, found in a number of lymphoid neoplasias, might
contribute to tumorigenesis.

Author information: 
(1)State of California, Department of Food and Agriculture, Anaheim 92801.

This research was comprised of two parts: quantitative analyses, and confirmatory
test. In the quantitative analyses, five classes of fruits and vegetables
comprising 10 individual commodities were fortified with triclopyr herbicide at
0.4 and 0.8 ppm level. Triclopyr was extracted from the matrices and derivatized 
separately to 2-chloroethylene ester with 2-chloroethanol-BCl3 and methyl ester
with diazomethane. The esters were then quantitated by GC-ECD and GC-NPD. The
GC-ECD recoveries for 2-chloroethylene ester were 100.0% and 100.7% at 0.4 ppm
and 0.8 ppm fortification levels, respectively, whereas methyl ester recovery was
103.9% at 0.4 ppm fortification level. Similarly, the GC-NPD recoveries for
2-chloroethylene ester were 99.0% and 97.9% at 0.4 ppm and 0.8 ppm fortification 
levels respectively, whereas methyl ester recovery was 102.0% at 0.4 ppm
fortification level. In the confirmatory test, the 2-chloroethylene ester was
introduced into a GC-ion trap. The EI mass spectrum was then interpreted based on
the criteria of molecular ion, isotopes, base ion, characteristic ions and the
nitrogen rule. Compared to existing methods, this method has reduced partition
solvents to nearly one-tenth. In addition, this method proved to be simple, fast,
safe and accurate.

Structural and functional analysis of NF-kappa B. Determinants of DNA binding
specificity and protein interaction.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center,
Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.

The NF-kappa B transcription factors display a high degree of sequence
conservation in a domain initially described in the rel oncogene. Two family
members, NF-kappa B1 and NF-kappa B2, have distinct DNA binding properties and
functionally distinct effects on different enhancers. NF-kappa B1, for example,
binds to the kappa B site from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with
approximately 15-fold higher affinity than NF-kappa B2. In this study, we have
defined regions within the Rel domain which determine DNA binding specificity and
interaction with other proteins. We find that the COOH-terminal putative Rel
dimerization domain of NF-kappa B1 is required for preferential binding to the
HIV kappa B site. In contrast, preferential stimulation of the HIV enhancer by
NF-kappa B2 with RelA(p65) is determined by both the NH2- and COOH-terminal Rel
domains of NF-kappa B2. These two regions of NF-kappa B2 also mediate
preferential synergy with Bcl3. These data suggest that a specific subdomain of
the Rel conserved region has evolved to control the fine specificity of DNA
binding, and two distinct subregions within the Rel domain determine the
specificity of interaction with other transcription factors. These specific
Rel-conserved domains therefore determine the specificity of NF-kappa B
interactions and contribute to selective gene activation.

Genomic structure of the candidate proto-oncogene BCL3.

McKeithan TW(1), Ohno H, Dickstein J, Hume E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.

We previously reported the identification of a novel candidate proto-oncogene
involved in the translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13) found in some cases of human
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This gene, BCL3, is a member of the I kappa 
B family, whose encoded proteins regulate the NF-kappa B family of transcription 
factors. Here we describe the genomic structure of BCL3. The gene contains nine
exons, spanning 11.5 kb. In comparison to other members of the I kappa B family, 
there is a remarkable conservation of the exon-intron boundaries in relation to
the coding sequences, consistent with an origin from a common ancestral gene.
BCL3 is unusual in containing two CpG islands, a 5' island encompassing the first
exon, the other lying within the gene. Southern blot analysis using
methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes revealed that while the 5' CpG is
unmethylated in all tissues tested, the degree of methylation of the internal CpG
island varies.

The putative glioma tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 19q maps between APOC2
and HRC.

The frequent allelic loss of chromosome 19q in human gliomas suggests that 19q
harbors a tumor suppressor gene that is integral to glioma tumorigenesis. Our
initial deletion mapping of this gene localized the common region of deletion to 
the distal long arm, 19q13.2-13.4. To bracket the putative tumor suppressor gene 
further, we have studied this region in 55 gliomas, using loss of heterozygosity 
studies for 11 well mapped, highly informative microsatellite polymorphisms that 
cover this area: D19S178; BCL3; APOC2; ERCC1; DM; D19S112; HRC; D19S246; KLK;
D19S180; and D19S254 (from centromeric to telomeric). Twenty astrocytic,
oligodendroglial, and mixed gliomas had deletions affecting this region. Of nine 
partial deletions, two cases maintained heterozygosity at APOC2 while showing
allelic loss at the more telomeric markers, ERCC1 and DM, while five cases
maintained heterozygosity at HRC but lost the more centromeric markers, D19S112
and DM. Nine cases lost the entire D19S178 to D19S254 region. Three astrocytic
gliomas, including one with an interstitial deletion, had terminal deletions of
19q13.4. The minimum area of overlap shared by the interstitial deletions is
between APOC2 and HRC, including ERCC1, DM, and D19S112. These findings suggest
that the glioma tumor suppressor gene maps to an approximately 8-cM/5-megabase
region on 19q13.2-13.3 between the proximal marker APOC2 and the distal marker
HRC. Among the DNA repair/DNA metabolism genes on chromosome 19q, ERCC1, LIG1,
and perhaps ERCC2 are within the common area of deletion; XRCC1 is centromeric
and is therefore excluded as a candidate.

BCL3 encodes a nuclear protein which can alter the subcellular location of
NF-kappa B proteins.

Zhang Q(1), Didonato JA, Karin M, McKeithan TW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.

BCL3 is a candidate proto-oncogene involved in the recurring translocation
t(14;19) found in some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. BCL3 protein
acts as an I kappa B in that it can specifically inhibit the DNA binding of
NF-kappa B factors. Here, we demonstrate that BCL3 is predominantly a nuclear
protein and provide evidence that its N terminus is necessary to direct the
protein into the nucleus. In contrast to I kappa B alpha (MAD3), BCL3 does not
cause NF-kappa B p50 to be retained in the cytoplasm; instead, in cotransfection 
assays, it alters the subnuclear localization of p50. The two proteins
colocalize, suggesting that they interact in vivo. Further immunofluorescence
experiments showed that a mutant p50, lacking a nuclear localization signal and
restricted to the cytoplasm, is brought into the nucleus in the presence of BCL3.
Correspondingly, a wild-type p50 directs into the nucleus a truncated BCL3,
which, when transfected alone, is found in the cytoplasm. We tested whether BCL3 
could overcome the cytoplasmic retention of p50 by I kappa B alpha. Results from 
triple cotransfection experiments with BCL3, I kappa B alpha, and p50 implied
that BCL3 can successfully compete with I kappa B alpha and bring p50 into the
nucleus; thus, localization of NF-kappa B factors may be affected by differential
expression of I kappa B proteins. These novel properties of BCL3 protein further 
establish BCL3 as a distinctive member of the I kappa B family.

The t(14;19)(q32;q13) is a recurring translocation found in some patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and the t(14;19) juxtaposes the BCL3 gene on 
chromosome 19 with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) locus on chromosome 
14. Genomic DNAs from 49 patients with chronic B-cell leukemia and the related
lymphomas were examined by Southern blot hybridization using 2 separate probes,
named p alpha 1.4P and p alpha .5B, from the BCL3 gene locus. None of the 18
patients with leukemic manifestations of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas had detectable
BCL3 rearrangements. Of 31 patients with CLL, 2 had the BCL3 rearrangements. A
comigration study using the C alpha and C epsilon constant gene probe from IGH
indicated that the t(14;19) translocation occurred in these 2 patients, and they 
were diagnosed with CLL/prolymphocytic (PL) according to the
French-American-British (FAB) classification. Probes for the IGH locus revealed
that leukemia cells of the 2 patients each were clonal, indicating that both
small lymphocytes and prolymphocytoid cells found in the peripheral blood of one 
patient had the t(14;19), as well as a major population of the small lymphocytes 
in the peripheral blood of a second patient. It thus appears that tumor cells
carrying the t(14;19) constitute a distinct disease entity in a group of chronic 
B-cell leukemia, that has a converting potential to more aggressive forms.

Medical School, Ein Kerem, Jerusalem, Israel.

Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder and the
most common adult form of muscular dystrophy. The age of onset and degree of
severity of DM is highly variable. The biochemical defect in DM is unknown. DM
was the first autosomal disorder to be localised by genetic linkage to protein
markers (Lu, Se, C3), and assigned to chromosome 19. Linkage studies in DM
families using RFLPs as polymorphic markers refined the mapping position to
19q13.1-13.2 distal to the BCL3, apoCII, CKM and ERCCI genes. Based on the
linkage data, healthy individuals from DM families request a pre-symptomatic
test. The information is of use in planning their family, if at high risk they
can choose to have prenatal diagnosis. We have studied ten unrelated DM families 
by linkage analysis. The DNA probes to detect the various RFLPS were either from 
the vicinity of BCL3, ApoCII, CKMM and ECCRI genes or anonymous DNA probes.
Linkage analysis in the DM families enabled us to determine the carrier status of
healthy individuals and to perform prenatal diagnosis at a confidence of > 99%.
In two families the DM diagnosis was in doubt and we did not include them in the 
combined analysis. Linkage disequilibrium was noted with two RFLPs pDIO/Pst1 and 
p37.1/BamH1. Both DNA probes were isolated by Shaw and his group in Cardiff. In
six out of eight families, the DM chromosome was associated with allele 3 of
pDIO/Pst1 and allele 1 of p37.1/BamH1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The cell surface expression of multiple immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)
isotypes, preferentially observed in hairy cell leukemia (HCL), is incompatible
with the deletion model of IGH class switching, and alternative models involving 
RNA-splicing have been proposed. To help discriminate between these possibilities
we have examined the configuration of the IGH locus by DNA blot in 38 cases of
HCL. Deletion of at least one allele of C mu/C delta was seen in 14 cases (37%). 
Of 12 cases in which IgG and/or IgA were expressed, three exhibited biallelic
deletion of C mu/C delta compatible with deletional class-switching whereas the
remaining 9 cases retained both alleles of C mu/C delta. These data indicate that
both DNA deletion and RNA-splicing mechanisms of class-switching may operate in
HCL. In a further 17 cases, other unexpected abnormalities of the IGH locus
mapping to the JH-C mu intron in one of two patterns were observed. First,
discordance between JH and C mu in BamHI DNA digests was found in 12 cases.
Similar patterns were observed in only 4/91 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia and 0/15 of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. To preclude chromosomal
translocations involving the JH-C mu intron, rearrangements of BCL1, BCL2, BCL3, 
and MYC were sought in 23 cases but none of the cases showed oncogene
rearrangement to the intron. Second, abnormal-sized C mu fragments arising as a
consequence of abnormalities of the JH-C mu intron were detected in HindIII,
BgIII, and/or Xbal digests in 10/23 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Molecular characterization of the t(14;19)(q32;q13) translocation in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia.

The t(14;19)(q32;q13) is a recurring translocation found in leukemic cells of
some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The BCL3 gene was
identified on chromosome 19 adjacent to the breakpoint of the translocation, and 
has been proposed to be a candidate proto-oncogene which may play a role in
leukemogenesis. The current study of a Japanese patient with CLL revealed that
the (14;19) is reciprocal at the molecular level; the BCL3 gene was juxtaposed to
the 5' side of the S alpha 1 switch region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene
(IGH) on the der(14) chromosome, and the IGH gene 5' to the S alpha 1 region was 
joined to chromosome 19 sequences on the der(19) reciprocal partner chromosome.
The breakpoint on chromosome 19 was 16 kb upstream of the first exon of the BCL3 
gene and 7 bp of chromosome 19 sequences were deleted at the point of the
junction. The t(14;19) translocations so far molecularly analyzed consistently
occurred within one of the two S alpha switch regions; however, sequence analysis
of the chromosome 19 regions involved in the translocation failed to demonstrate 
an obvious sequence similarity with the switch region. The chromosomal breaks on 
chromosome 19 from two CLL patients having the t(14;19) were within Alu repeated 
sequences.

Cloning and sequencing of a t(14;19) breakpoint that involves the C mu switch
region.

The t(14;19) is a recurring translocation found in a small number of cases of
chronic B-cell leukemia (CLL). We have cloned and sequenced the breakpoint in a
patient with a t(14;19) and shown that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurred
in the C mu switch region, and that the breakpoint on chromosome 19 occurred in
the 5' untranslated region of the BCL3 gene. This is in contrast to all the other
reported cases with a t(14;19) in which the breakpoints on chromosome 14 occurred
in the C alpha 1 or C alpha 2 switch region, and the breakpoints on chromosome 19
occurred upstream of the BCL3 gene. Our results further emphasize the importance 
of the switch region in the t(14;19) translocation.

Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298-003.

We examined the three Alzheimer's disease (AD) family data sets for
heterogeneity. Four markers that were represented in all three data sets were
selected for analysis. Markers BCL3/EcoR-Mlu and D19S13/TaqI were chosen for
chromosome 19 and D21S13/TaqI and D21S16/XbaI for chromosome 21. Homogeneity
testing was performed on the data by use of Morton's pre-divided samples test
(PS-test) and Smith's admixture test (A-test). The C-test of MacLean et al.
[1992] was also used to test for linkage in the presence of heterogeneity.
Assuming homogeneity, there was significant evidence of linkage to AD for BCL3,
D19S13, D21S16 in the Duke data set and D19S13, D21S16 in the Boston data set.
C-tests also provided evidence of linkage for BCL3 and D21S13 in the Duke data
set, and D21S16 in the Boston data set. No evidence for heterogeneity within the 
data sets was found for any of the four markers using either the A-test or the
C-test. For marker BCL3, PS-tests found evidence of heterogeneity between the
three data sets and between early-versus late-onset families combined over all
data sets.

Diverse molecular mechanisms of inhibition of NF-kappa B/DNA binding complexes by
I kappa B proteins.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular Biology and Viroiogy Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA
92186-5800.

The activity of the rel/NF-kappa B/dorsal family of kappa B site binding proteins
is regulated by I kappa B proteins. The ankyrin repeat motif identified I kappa B
family members, which include I kappa B alpha (pp40/MAD-3), I kappa B gamma, and 
bcl3, directly associated with kappa B site binding proteins, resulting in
specific DNA-binding inhibition of rel, p50, or p65 dimers. We report that I
kappa B gamma, containing eight ankyrin repeats, mediates a reversible inhibition
of (p50)2-DNA complex but cannot displace preformed DNA-protein complexes. I
kappa B alpha and bcl3, on the other hand, can displace preformed DNA-protein
complexes. I kappa B alpha specifically displaces (p65)2 or p50/p65-DNA complexes
but requires the C-terminal 37 amino acids in addition to the ankyrin repeat
domain. Human bcl3 protein specifically displaces (p50)2-DNA complexes. Because I
kappa B alpha and bcl3 can displace preformed (p65)2 or (p50)2-DNA complexes,
respectively, we propose that they can act as repressors or antirepressors of
NF-kappa B-induced gene expression.

München, Germany.

A locus for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) has been localized on
chromosome 19q12-13.2, while at the same time the gene encoding the skeletal
muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) also has been mapped to this region and has been
found to be tightly linked to MHS. RYR1 was consequently postulated as the
candidate for the molecular defect causing MHS, and a point mutation in the gene 
has now been identified and is thought to be the cause of MH in at least some MHS
patients. Here we report the results of a linkage study done with 19q12-13.2
markers, including the RYR1 cDNA, in two Bavarian families with MHS. In one of
the families, three unambiguous recombination events between MHS and the RYR1
locus were found. In the second family only one informative meiosis was seen with
RYR1. However, segregation analysis with markers for D19S75, D19S28, D19S47,
CYP2A, BCL3, and APOC2 shows that the crossovers in the first family involve the 
entire haplotype defined by these markers flanking RYR1 and, furthermore, reveals
multiple crossovers between these haplotypes and MHS in the second family. In
these families, pairwise and multipoint lod scores below -2 exclude MHS from an
interval spanning more than 26 cM and comprising the RYR1 and the previously
described MHS locus. Our findings thus strongly suggest genetic heterogeneity of 
the MHS trait and prompt the search for another MHS locus.

Toxicological investigations in the semiconductor industry: I. Studies on the
acute oral toxicity of a complex mixture of waste products from the aluminium
plasma etching process.

In dry etching processes--one of the sources of potential exposure to toxic
wastes in the semiconductor industry--complex mixtures of inorganic and organic
compounds arise from reactions between feed stock gases (BCl3/Cl2), top layers
(aluminium photoresist), and the carrier gas (N2). Two different fractions of the
complex mixture--one an ethanolic solution (ES) and the other an insoluble liquid
residue (LR)--were examined for acute oral toxicity in rats. Analytical data
showed that the ethanol soluble fraction contained mainly inorganic compounds,
whereas the residue contained various halogenated hydrocarbons. Neither death nor
behavioral changes occurred after oral administration and observation up to 23
days. ES caused a lower mean arterial blood pressure in both sexes, increased
P-R-intervals in male rats, and caused some mild biochemical and hematological
alterations and changes in relative organ weights compared to the control groups.
Exposure to LR influenced food and water intake, and caused a significant
decrease in body weights, signs of polyurie, as well as changes in various
relative organ weights and biochemical and hematological parameters. The blood
pressure of the male animals fell and the heart rates of both sexes decreased.

Translocation (14;19)(q32;q13.1) is an acquired chromosomal rearrangement that
has been associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell phenotype
frequently progressing to lymphoma. Molecular analysis suggests that the
translocation involves the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14 and
the BCL3 oncogene on chromosome 19. We present the first case of t(14;19) in a
patient with acute leukemia. Correlation of detailed cytogenetic and molecular
genetic studies, cell surface marker analysis, cytochemistry, and electron
microscopy indicated that the leukemic cells were biophenotypic, with
characteristics consistent with both myeloid and B-lineage lymphoid
differentiation.

Identification of a transcriptional unit adjacent to the breakpoint in the 14;19 
translocation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The t(14;19)(q32.3;q13.1) is a recurring translocation found in the neoplastic
cells of some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have
previously cloned the translocation breakpoint junction present in the leukemic
cells from one such patient. In the present study, we have cloned and sequenced
the breakpoint junction from a second patient. The breakpoint on chromosome 14
occurs within a switch region upstream of the immunoglobulin heavy chain C alpha 
1 sequence. We detected a 2.1-2.3 kb transcript on Northern blots using a probe
from chromosome 19 adjacent to this breakpoint. S1 nuclease protection
experiments showed that transcription of the gene proceeds in a direction away
from the breakpoint junction. This gene (for which we propose the name BCL3) may 
contribute to the malignant development of B-lymphocytes following the chromosome
translocation. If so, it is the first protooncogene identified whose activation
is principally associated with CLL.

Molecular genetic linkage studies on the inherited human disorder malignant
hyperthermia have resulted in the mapping of the locus for malignant hyperthermia
susceptibility (MHS) to the twenty centimorgan genetic interval in the q12-13.2
region of chromosome 19 defined by the anonymous polymorphic DNA markers D19S9
and BCL3. The mapping of the MHS locus to this interval now allows diagnosis of
MHS in selected families with an accuracy of 97.5% using closely linked
polymorphic DNA markers.

Activation of MYC in a masked t(8;17) translocation results in an aggressive
B-cell leukemia.

School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140.

We have analyzed the oncogene rearrangements involving BCL2 and MYC in the
leukemia cells of a patient with an aggressive prolymphocytic leukemia that had
an abnormal karyotype including a t(14;18) translocation and a chromosome 17q+.
Molecular analysis showed that BCL2 was rearranged in the major breakpoint
cluster region and had joined into the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene as in
follicular lymphoma. Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged MYC gene
revealed that MYC was truncated at the Pvu II site at the end of the first exon
of MYC and had joined into the regulatory elements of a gene that we called BCL3 
(B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3). The BCL3 locus was mapped to chromosome 17 band
q22. We found BCL3 transcribed as a message of 1.7 kilobases in many
hematopoietic cell lines representing all hematopoietic lineages. In the
patient's leukemia cells, the truncated MYC gene was highly expressed under the
influence of BCL3 regulatory elements, leading to an aggressive B-cell leukemia
that presumably had been derived from an indolent lymphoma carrying a rearranged 
BCL2 gene.

Author information:

School, London, England.

We previously reported a recombination in an individual with myotonic dystrophy
(DM) which placed the markers D19S19 and APOC2 on the same side of the DM locus. 
Haplotyping of this family with more recently characterized probes which are
either tightly linked to DM or distal to the linkage group at q13.2 shows that
the DM locus is distal to APOC2. This is confirmed by other recombinants where DM
segregates with distal probes. Additional marker to marker recombinations in
unaffected individuals are reported and support the order and orientation of the 
DM linkage group as pter-(INSR, LDLR,S9)-(S19,BCL3,APOC2)-(CKMM,DM)-(S22,+
++PRKCG)-qter. The data presented here cannot determine whether DM is proximal or
distal to CKMM. The consequences of this probe order for antenatal diagnosis and 
future research aiming to isolate the gene which is affected in DM are discussed.

Quantitative conversion of diether or tetraether phospholipids to
glycerophosphoesters by dealkylation with boron trichloride: a tool for
structural analysis of archaebacterial lipids.

Nishihara M(1), Koga Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 
Kitakyushu, Japan.

A method for preparing glycerophosphoesters from ether phospholipids by
dealkylation with boron trichloride (BCl3) is described. Treatment of ether
phospholipids in chloroform with BCl3 for 30 min at room temperature yielded
almost quantitatively the corresponding glycerophosphoesters retaining the intact
polar head group of the ether phospholipids. Thus, glycerophosphocholine,
glycerophosphoinositol, glycerophosphoglycerol, glycerophosphoserine,
glycerophosphate, and glycerophosphoethanolamine were prepared from the diether
analogs of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid, and the tetraether analog of
phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. BCl3 also cleaved diacyl, alkyl-acyl, and
alk-1-enyl-acyl forms of phospholipids to yield corresponding
glycerophosphoesters. The glycerophosphoesters were separated more rapidly by
cellulose thin-layer chromatography with the same solvent system as in paper
chromatography. This method is of great use for structure determination of
glycerophosphoester backbones of ether phospholipids, analogous to the mild
alkaline methanolysis of diacyl form of phospholipids, as well as for the
analysis of alkyl chains. It is, however, not applicable to glycolipids because
of cleavage of glycosidic bonds by BCl3.

Extraction and composition of polar lipids from the archaebacterium,
Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum: effective extraction of tetraether lipids
by an acidified solvent.

Nishihara M, Koga Y.

The usual Bligh and Dyer method could extract only a small part of the lipids of 
Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. When the water in the solvent was replaced 
by 5% trichloroacetic acid, the lipid recovery reached the maximum level, which
was 6 times higher than that by the former method. The use of HCl (2 M) or
disruption of cells was also effective but prolonged extraction with the
HCl-containing solvent caused degradation of some phosphoglycolipids.
Twenty-three spots of polar lipids were detected on a thin-layer chromatogram of 
the total lipid. These were 10 phospholipids (18%), 6 aminophospholipids (17%), 3
aminophosphoglycolipids (15%), 2 phosphoglycolipids (31%), and 2 glycolipids
(19%). The predominant polar lipids were a highly polar phosphoglycolipid (PGL1, 
30%) and a glycolipid (GL1a, 16%). The other major lipids included an
aminophospholipid (PNL1a, 9%), and an aminophosphoglycolipid (PNGL1, 7%). The
complete structure determination of PNL1a, GL1a, and PNGL1 is described in the
accompanying paper. Acetolysis of the total lipids followed by acid methanolysis 
was required for the complete cleavage of polar head groups, releasing core
residues of diphytanyl glycerol diether (C20 diether) and dibiphytanyl diglycerol
tetraether (C40 tetraether). A densitometric assay of a thin-layer chromatogram
showed that the ratio of C20 diether and C40 tetraether was 1:14. GLC analysis of
alkyl chlorides prepared from the total lipid by BCl3 treatment showed that
phytanyl (C20), biphytanyl (C40), and unidentified alkyl chains accounted for 10,
83, and 7 mol% of the total alkyl chains, respectively. Strong acid hydrolysis of
the macromolecular residue obtained after lipid extraction gave a significant
amount of C40 tetraether, which had probably been bound covalently to other
substances in the cells.

A rapid gas chromatographic procedure for the analysis of oxalate ion in urine.

Moye HA, Malagodi MH, Clarke DH, Miles CJ.

A specific, precise, rapid and sensitive method for the analysis of oxalic acid
in urine is described. This microanalytical procedure can detect concentrations
of urinary oxalic acid as low as 4 mg/l with a relative standard deviation of
replicates of less than 5% (24-h urine collections). 10% BCl3:2-chloroethanol is 
used to derivatize 0.1 ml of urine after evaporation to dryness or
lyophilization. The bis-2-chloroethyl ester of oxalic acid formed is extracted
into ethyl acetate/isopropyl ether (1:3, v/v) and is detected by electron capture
gas chromatography at the 50 pg level. The total analysis time for 35 samples in 
8 h per GC column. A series of determinations of urinary oxalic acid in 21 kidney
stone-forming patients resulted in values ranging from 10.6 to 42.0 mg/24 h with 
a mean recovery of added oxalic acid of 98.2% (range 84.0-111.3%).

Applications of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry in neurochemical
studies: determination of indole amine profiles at the picogram level.

Segura J, Gelpi E.

Work is presented on the application of sensitive and specific analytical methods
for the simultaneous assay of tryptophan and its indolic metabolites
(5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid, tryptamine and
indoleacetic acid). Due to their small concentrations in selected areas of the
central nervous system, suitable derivatives have been prepared for separation by
Gas Chromatography (GC) and detection by electron capture (ECD). Carboxylic acid 
groups have been methylated with BCl3-methanol and phenolic and amine groups have
been acylated to pentafluoropropionyl derivatives. This type of derivatives allow
a detectability limit of 5 picograms (5 x 10(-12) gr) if the corresponding
reaction kinetics and yields are properly optimized. Response curves are
presented. Identifications have been obtained by combined GC-MS and by the use of
Kovats indeces in two GC stationary phases. The GC separation of the six
compounds indicated above can be performed in less than 5 minutes with
quantitative reproducibility. This work opens the possibility of performing
comparative studies ("screening") of various physiological and pathological
conditions by detecting any changes in the profile representative of a whole
metabolic pathway, such as that of the indolic compounds in this case.
