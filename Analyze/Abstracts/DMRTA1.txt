Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 80
susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but most of its heritability still
remains to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for
T2D in the Japanese population. Combined data from discovery and subsequent
validation analyses (23,399 T2D cases and 31,722 controls) identify 7 new loci
with genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), rs1116357 near CCDC85A, rs147538848
in FAM60A, rs1575972 near DMRTA1, rs9309245 near ASB3, rs67156297 near ATP8B2,
rs7107784 near MIR4686 and rs67839313 near INAFM2. Of these, the association of 4
loci with T2D is replicated in multi-ethnic populations other than Japanese (up
to 65,936 T2Ds and 158,030 controls, P<0.007). These results indicate that
expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility 
loci to complex traits not only for ethnicity-specific loci but also for common
loci across different ethnicities.

The transcription factor Pax6 is comprised of the paired domain (PD) and
homeodomain (HD). In the developing forebrain, Pax6 is expressed in ventricular
zone precursor cells and in specific subpopulations of neurons; absence of Pax6
results in disrupted cell proliferation and cell fate specification. Pax6 also
regulates the entire lens developmental program. To reconstruct Pax6-dependent
gene regulatory networks (GRNs), ChIP-seq studies were performed using forebrain 
and lens chromatin from mice. A total of 3514 (forebrain) and 3723 (lens)
Pax6-containing peaks were identified, with ~70% of them found in both tissues
and thereafter called 'common' peaks. Analysis of Pax6-bound peaks identified
motifs that closely resemble Pax6-PD, Pax6-PD/HD and Pax6-HD established binding 
sequences. Mapping of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and RNA polymerase II
revealed distinct types of tissue-specific enhancers bound by Pax6. Pax6 directly
regulates cortical neurogenesis through activation (e.g. Dmrta1 and Ngn2) and
repression (e.g. Ascl1, Fezf2, and Gsx2) of transcription factors. In lens, Pax6 
directly regulates cell cycle exit via components of FGF (Fgfr2, Prox1 and Ccnd1)
and Wnt (Dkk3, Wnt7a, Lrp6, Bcl9l, and Ccnd1) signaling pathways. Collectively,
these studies provide genome-wide analysis of Pax6-dependent GRNs in lens and
forebrain and establish novel roles of Pax6 in organogenesis.

PURPOSE: High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) to
treat multiple myeloma (MM) and other cancers carries the risk of oral mucositis 
(OM) with sequelae including impaired nutritional and fluid intake, pain, and
infectious complications. As a result of these problems, cancer treatment may
have to be interrupted or delayed. In this study, we looked beyond OM's known
risk factors of renal function and melphalan dose with a genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) to evaluate whether genetic variants in conjunction with clinical
risk factors influence predisposition for OM.
METHODS: Genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 BeadChip
and further assessed for data quality. We tested 892,589 germline
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with OM among 972
Caucasian patients treated with high-dose melphalan and ASCT in Total Therapy
clinical trials (TT2, TT3, TT4) for newly diagnosed MM. Statistical analyses
included t tests, stepwise regression modeling, and logistic regression modeling 
to find baseline clinical factors and genotypes associated with OM.
RESULTS: We found that 353 (36.3 %) patients had grades 2-4 OM. Type of treatment
protocol, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and melphalan dose along
with baseline serum albumin and female gender predicted 43.6 % of grades 2-4 OM
cases. Eleven SNPs located in or near matrix metalloproteinase 13, JPH3, DHRS7C, 
CEP192, CPEB1/LINC00692, FBN2, ALDH1A1, and DMRTA1/FLJ35282 were associated with 
grades 2-4 OM. The addition of these SNPs increased sensitivity in detecting
grades 2-4 OM cases to 52 %.
CONCLUSIONS: These SNPs may be important for their roles in inflammatory
pathways, epithelial healing, and chemotherapy detoxification.

Dmrta1 regulates proneural gene expression downstream of Pax6 in the mammalian
telencephalon.

The transcription factor Pax6 balances cell proliferation and neuronal
differentiation in the mammalian developing neocortex by regulating the
expression of target genes. Using microarray analysis, we observed the
down-regulation of Dmrta1 (doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor-like 
family A1) in the telencephalon of Pax6 homozygous mutant rats (rSey(2) /rSey(2) 
). Dmrta1 expression was restricted to the neural stem/progenitor cells of the
dorsal telencephalon. Overexpression of Dmrta1 induced the expression of the
proneural gene Neurogenin2 (Neurog2) and conversely repressed Ascl1 (Mash1), a
proneural gene expressed in the ventral telencephalon. We found that another Dmrt
family molecule, Dmrt3, induced Neurog2 expression in the dorsal telencephalon.
Our novel findings suggest that dual regulation of proneural genes mediated by
Pax6 and Dmrt family members is crucial for cortical neurogenesis.

Foxg1 coordinates the switch from nonradially to radially migrating glutamatergic
subtypes in the neocortex through spatiotemporal repression.

Biology, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.

The specification of neuronal subtypes in the cerebral cortex proceeds in a
temporal manner; however, the regulation of the transitions between the
sequentially generated subtypes is poorly understood. Here, we report that the
forkhead box transcription factor Foxg1 coordinates the production of neocortical
projection neurons through the global repression of a default gene program. The
delayed activation of Foxg1 was necessary and sufficient to induce deep-layer
neurogenesis, followed by a sequential wave of upper-layer neurogenesis. A
genome-wide analysis revealed that Foxg1 binds to mammalian-specific noncoding
sequences to repress over 12 transcription factors expressed in early
progenitors, including Ebf2/3, Dmrt3, Dmrta1, and Eya2. These findings reveal an 
unexpected prolonged competence of progenitors to initiate corticogenesis at a
progressed stage during development and identify Foxg1 as a critical initiator of
neocorticogenesis through spatiotemporal repression, a system that balances the
production of nonradially and radially migrating glutamatergic subtypes during
mammalian cortical expansion.

Zebrafish dmrta2 regulates the expression of cdkn2c in spermatogenesis in the
adult testis.

of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.

The exact function of the doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor-like
family a2 gene (dmrta2) has remained largely unknown possibly because of its
functional redundancy with dmrta1 in most vertebrates. In this study, dmrta1 was 
demonstrated to likely be absent in the zebrafish genome, which facilitated our
functional analysis of dmrta2 in this model organism. To analyze its gene
function in embryos and adults, we generated a mutant form of Dmrta2 (R106Q,
Dmrta2(RQ)) with its in vitro DNA-binding capacity abolished and a transgenic
line for the inducible expression of this mutant Dmrta2(RQ) upon doxycycline
(Dox) treatment. Preferential dmrta2 expression was detected in the developing
brain during embryogenesis and in the adult testis. During embryogenesis,
Dmrta2(RQ) expression caused severe embryonic development defects and dramatic
expression changes of two telencephalic marker genes, fibroblast growth factor 8a
(fgf8a), and empty spiracles homolog 1 (emx1). In adults, the inducible
Dmrta2(RQ) expression occurred specifically in the adult testis and recapitulated
the endogenous dmrta2 expression in this organ. Intriguingly, adult males
expressing dmrta2(RQ) showed normal spermatogenesis and were fertile, but the
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (cdkn2c), which is
evolutionarily clustered with dmrta2, was significantly suppressed during
spermatogenesis. Further protein-binding and promoter mutation analysis indicated
that a putative Dmrta2-binding site on the cdkn2c promoter was required for
sustaining the normal expression of cdkn2c during zebrafish spermatogenesis,
suggesting that Dmrta2 might regulate the expression of cdkn2c.

Proteins containing the DM domain, a zinc finger-like DNA binding motif, have
been implicated in sexual differentiation in diverse metazoan organisms. Of seven
mammalian DM domain genes, only Dmrt1 and Dmrt2 have been functionally analyzed. 
Here, we report expression analysis and targeted disruption of Dmrt4 (also called
DmrtA1) in the mouse. Dmrt4 is widely expressed during embryonic and postnatal
development. However, we find that mice homozygous for a putative null mutation
in Dmrt4 develop essentially normally, undergo full sexual differentiation in
both sexes, and are fertile. We observed two potential mutant phenotypes in Dmrt4
mutant mice. First, ovaries of most mutant females have polyovular follicles,
suggesting a role in folliculogenesis. Second, 25% of mutant males consistently
exhibited copulatory behavior toward other males. We also tested potential
redundancy between Dmrt4 and two other gonadally expressed DM domain genes, Dmrt1
and Dmrt7. We observed no enhancement of gonadal phenotypes in the double
mutants, suggesting that these genes function independently in gonadal
development.

Sex determining genes Mab-3 of C. elegans and Doublesex of Drosophila contain a
common DNA binding motif called DM (Doublesex and Mab-3) domain, both of which
regulate similar aspects of sexual development. Human Doublesex-related gene
DMRT1 has been identified, which also contains the conserved DM-related
DNA-binding domain and plays an essential role in gonadal differentiation. We
amplified genomic DNA of the giant panda using the DM degenerate primers and
detected two bands, approximately 140 bp and 250 bp. After cloned into T-easy
vector and sequenced, four sequences showed high homology with the DM domain.
Amino acid sequence of the first clone is 100% identical with the Dmrt1 of human,
mouse and pig, hence we named it as pDmrt1. The second clone is 96% identical
with human DMRTB1, and the third one 100% with the Dmrt3 of mouse and medaka,
which were named as pDmrtb1 and pDmrt3 respectively. The last sequence contains
an intron of 116 bp within the DM domain, which encodes an amino acid sequence
100% identical with human DMRTC2, accordingly we named it as pDmrtc2. Based on
similarities of amino acid sequences of the DM domain, Dmrt protein sequences
from human, mouse and giant panda were included in a phylogenetic tree. They
revealed seven distinct subgroups: Dmrt1, Dmrt2, Dmrt3, Dmrt4 (DMRTA1), Dmrt5
(DMRTA2), Dmrt6 (DMRTB1) and Dmrt7 (DMRTC2). Our results further reveal the
unexpected complexity and the evolutionary conservation of the DM domain gene
family in both invertebrates and vertebrates.
