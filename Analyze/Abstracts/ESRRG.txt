Gastric Carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the world. A large number 
of differentially expressed genes have been identified as being associated with
gastric cancer progression, however, little is known about the underlying
regulatory mechanisms. To address this problem, we developed a differential
networking approach that is characterized by including a nascent methodology,
differential coexpression analysis (DCEA), and two novel quantitative methods for
differential regulation analysis. We first applied DCEA to a gene expression
dataset of gastric normal mucosa, adenoma and carcinoma samples to identify gene 
interconnection changes during cancer progression, based on which we inferred
normal, adenoma, and carcinoma-specific gene regulation networks by using linear 
regression model. It was observed that cancer genes and drug targets were
enriched in each network. To investigate the dynamic changes of gene regulation
during carcinogenesis, we then designed two quantitative methods to prioritize
differentially regulated genes (DRGs) and gene pairs or links (DRLs) between
adjacent stages. It was found that known cancer genes and drug targets are
significantly higher ranked. The top 4% normal vs. adenoma DRGs (36 genes) and
top 6% adenoma vs. carcinoma DRGs (56 genes) proved to be worthy of further
investigation to explore their association with gastric cancer. Out of the 16
DRGs involved in two top-10 DRG lists of normal vs. adenoma and adenoma vs.
carcinoma comparisons, 15 have been reported to be gastric cancer or cancer
related. Based on our inferred differential networking information and known
signaling pathways, we generated testable hypotheses on the roles of GATA6, ESRRG
and their signaling pathways in gastric carcinogenesis. Compared with established
approaches which build genome-scale GRNs, or sub-networks around differentially
expressed genes, the present one proved to be better at enriching cancer genes
and drug targets, and prioritizing disease-related genes on the dataset we
considered. We propose this extendable differential networking framework as a
promising way to gain insights into gene regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer 
progression and other phenotypic changes.

OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification which refers to ectopic mineralization in
vascular cells is associated with several conditions, such as chronic kidney
disease, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus. Estrogen-related receptor (ERR)<U+03B3>
is a member of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily, which plays diverse roles
in regulating homeostatic and metabolic processes. However, the role of ERR<U+03B3> in
vascular calcification has not been investigated to date. The aim of the present 
study was to examine the role of ERR<U+03B3> in vascular calcification.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Vascular calcification was induced by treating rat aortic
vascular smooth muscle cells with calcification medium. ERR<U+03B3> expression in
vascular smooth muscle cells was induced during calcification medium-induced
vascular calcification. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> in vascular
smooth muscle cells resulted in the upregulation of the expression of osteogenic 
genes, including runt-related transcription factor 2, osteopontin, and Msx2, and 
the downregulation of a-smooth muscle actin. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression
of ERR<U+03B3> induced bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression, leading to
increased phosphorylation of the intracellular BMP2 effector proteins SMAD1/5/8. 
Collectively, these data suggested that ERR<U+03B3> promotes dedifferentiation of
vascular smooth muscle cells to an osteogenic phenotype during the vascular
calcification process. Inhibition of endogenous ERR<U+03B3> expression or activity using
a specific siRNA or the selective inverse agonist GSK5182 attenuated vascular
calcification and osteogenic gene expression in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that ERR<U+03B3> plays a key role in vascular 
calcification by upregulating the BMP2 signaling pathway, suggesting that
inhibition of ERR<U+03B3> is a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of
vascular calcification.

Bile acids are primarily synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and have
important roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homoeostasis.
Detailed roles of the orphan nuclear receptors regulating cholesterol
7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, have
not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we report that
oestrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is a novel transcriptional regulator of
CYP7A1 expression. Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor)
signalling induced ERR<U+03B3>-mediated transcription of the CYP7A1 gene. Overexpression
of ERR<U+03B3> increased CYP7A1 expression in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of
ERR<U+03B3> attenuated CYP7A1 expression. Deletion analysis of the CYP7A1 gene promoter 
and a ChIP assay revealed an ERR<U+03B3>-binding site on the CYP7A1 gene promoter. Small
heterodimer partner (SHP) inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERR<U+03B3> and thus
regulated CYP7A1 expression. Overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> led to increased bile acid
levels, whereas an inverse agonist of ERR<U+03B3>, GSK5182, reduced CYP7A1 expression
and bile acid synthesis. Finally, GSK5182 significantly reduced hepatic CB1
receptor-mediated induction of CYP7A1 expression and bile acid synthesis in
alcohol-treated mice. These results provide the molecular mechanism linking ERR<U+03B3> 
and bile acid metabolism.

Several studies show evidence for the genetic basis of renal disease, which
renders some individuals more prone than others to accelerated renal aging.
Studying the genetics of renal aging can help us to identify genes involved in
this process and to unravel the underlying pathways. First, this opinion article 
will give an overview of the phenotypes that can be observed in age-related
kidney disease. Accurate phenotyping is essential in performing genetic analysis.
For kidney aging, this could include both functional and structural changes.
Subsequently, this article reviews the studies that report on candidate genes
associated with renal aging in humans and mice. Several loci or candidate genes
have been found associated with kidney disease, but identification of the
specific genetic variants involved has proven to be difficult. CUBN, UMOD, and
SHROOM3 were identified by human GWAS as being associated with albuminuria,
kidney function, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These are promising examples
of genes that could be involved in renal aging, and were further mechanistically 
evaluated in animal models. Eventually, we will provide approaches for performing
genetic analysis. We should leverage the power of mouse models, as testing in
humans is limited. Mouse and other animal models can be used to explain the
underlying biological mechanisms of genes and loci identified by human GWAS.
Furthermore, mouse models can be used to identify genetic variants associated
with age-associated histological changes, of which Far2, Wisp2, and Esrrg are
examples. A new outbred mouse population with high genetic diversity will
facilitate the identification of genes associated with renal aging by enabling
high-resolution genetic mapping while also allowing the control of environmental 
factors, and by enabling access to renal tissues at specific time points for
histology, proteomics, and gene expression.

OBJECTIVE: To measure mitochondrial content and the expression of
estrogen-related receptor-<U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>, a major inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis)
in placentas from women with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) associated or
not with pre-eclampsia (PE), relative to control placentas.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: Teaching hospital and university research laboratory.
PATIENT(S): Thirty-nine placentas from women with IUGR, 8 IUGR+PE, and 30
controls.
INTERVENTION(S): None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mitochondrial DNA and protein content, gene and protein 
expression.
RESULT(S): We observed significantly lower placental mitochondrial DNA and
protein contents (associated with down-regulation of ERR<U+03B3> expression) in IUGR and
IUGR+PE placentas, relative to control placentas. Our results also revealed that 
the placental mitochondrial DNA content was directly correlated with fetal
weight. Moreover, we observed significantly lower peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator-1a and sirtuin 1 messenger RNA
expression levels in IUGR+PE placentas, relative to control placentas.
CONCLUSION(S): The low mitochondrial DNA and protein contents observed in IUGR
placentas are probably due to down-regulation of ERR<U+03B3> expression. This finding
suggests that ERR<U+03B3> has a major role in the control of placental development.

BACKGROUND: One-third of estrogen (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor-positive
(PGR+) breast tumors treated with Tamoxifen (TAM) do not respond to initial
treatment, and the remaining 70% are at risk to relapse in the future.
Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG, ERR<U+03B3>) is an orphan nuclear receptor with 
broad, structural similarities to classical ER that is widely implicated in the
transcriptional regulation of energy homeostasis. We have previously demonstrated
that ERR<U+03B3> induces resistance to TAM in ER+ breast cancer models, and that the
receptor's transcriptional activity is modified by activation of the ERK/MAPK
pathway. We hypothesize that hyper-activation or over-expression of ERR<U+03B3> induces 
a pro-survival transcriptional program that impairs the ability of TAM to inhibit
the growth of ER+ breast cancer. The goal of the present study is to determine
whether ERR<U+03B3> target genes are associated with reduced distant metastasis-free
survival (DMFS) in ER+ breast cancer treated with TAM.
METHODS: Raw gene expression data was obtained from 3 publicly available breast
cancer clinical studies of women with ER+ breast cancer who received TAM as their
sole endocrine therapy. ERR<U+03B3> target genes were selected from 2 studies that
published validated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses of ERR<U+03B3>
promoter occupancy. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to determine the association
of ERR<U+03B3> target genes with DMFS, and selected genes were validated in ER+, MCF7
breast cancer cells that express exogenous ERR<U+03B3>.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven validated receptor target genes were statistically
significantly altered in women who experienced a DM within 5 years, and could
classify several independent studies into poor vs. good DMFS. Two genes (EEF1A2
and PPIF) could similarly separate ER+, TAM-treated breast tumors by DMFS, and
their protein levels were measured in an ER+ breast cancer cell line model with
exogenous ERR<U+03B3>. Finally, expression of ERR<U+03B3> and these two target genes are
elevated in models of ER+ breast cancer with hyperactivation of ERK/MAPK.
CONCLUSIONS: ERR<U+03B3> signaling is associated with poor DMFS in ER+, TAM-treated
breast cancer, and ESRRG, EEF1A2, and PPIF comprise a 3-gene signaling node that 
may contribute to TAM resistance in the context of an active ERK/MAPK pathway.

Thalamocortical loops have been implicated in the control of higher-order
cognitive functions, but advances in our understanding of the molecular
underpinnings of neocortical organization have not been accompanied by similar
analyses in the thalamus. Using expression-based correlation maps and the manual 
mapping of mouse and human datasets available in the Allen Brain Atlas, we
identified a few individual regions and several sets of molecularly related
nuclei that partially overlap with the classic grouping that is based on
topographical localization and thalamocortical connections. These new molecular
divisions of the adult thalamic complex are defined by the combinatorial
expression of Tcf7l2, Lef1, Gbx2, Prox1, Pou4f1, Esrrg, and Six3 transcription
factor genes. Further in silico and experimental analyses provided the evidence
that TCF7L2 might be a pan-thalamic specifier. These results provide substantial 
insights into the "molecular logic" that underlies organization of the thalamic
complex.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer-related
death in China. Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) contributes to HCC development
by influencing cell growth, apoptosis, migration or invasion. It has been proved 
that miR-940 plays important roles in various cancers. Here we investigated the
role of miR-940 in HCC. We found that miR-940 was remarkably decreased in HCC
tissues and cell lines. Importantly, lower miR-940 expression in HCC tissues
significantly correlated with the reduced patient's survival rate. Overexpression
of miR-940 inhibited HCC cell line growth and induced cell apoptosis, and vice
versa. Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG) was targeted by miR-940, and
suppression of ESRRG inhibited HCC cell lines growth and induced cell apoptosis. 
In conclusion, we found that a lower level of miR-940 in HCC promoted cellular
proliferation via ESRRG, which may lead to the short survival period of HCC
patients.

The estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is a potential molecular target for the
development of small molecules to stimulate the adipose browning process, which
may represent a novel attractive strategy to treat obesity related disorders. The
receptor possesses a very small ligand binding cavity and therefore
identification of small molecule ERR<U+03B3> modulators is a considerable challenge. We 
have successfully designed and synthesized a series of
1-benzyl-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazoles and demonstrated that they improve the
transcriptional functions of ERR<U+03B3>, potently elevating both the mRNA levels and
the protein levels of ERR<U+03B3> downstream targets. One of the most promising
compounds, 4-(1-(4-iso-propylbenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)benzene-1,2-diol (2e) 
was further shown to directly bind with the ERR<U+03B3> ligand binding domain (ERR<U+03B3>-LBD)
in an isothermal calorimetric (ITC) assay and to thermally stabilize ERR<U+03B3>-LBD
protein by increasing its melting temperature (Tm) as demonstrated by circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Furthermore, 2e potently stimulates the adipocyte
browning process and induces mitochondrial biogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, 
suggesting the considerable therapeutic potential of this compound for the
treatment of obesity and related disorders.

Cell metabolism is adaptive to extrinsic demands; however, the intrinsic
metabolic demands that drive the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) program
remain unclear. Although glycolysis increases throughout the reprogramming
process, we show that the estrogen-related nuclear receptors (ERRa and ERR<U+03B3>) and 
their partnered co-factors PGC-1a and PGC-1ß are transiently induced at an early 
stage, resulting in a burst of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity.
Upregulation of ERRa or ERR<U+03B3> is required for the OXPHOS burst in both human and
mouse cells, respectively, as well as iPSC generation itself. Failure to induce
this metabolic switch collapses the reprogramming process. Furthermore, we
identify a rare pool of Sca1(-)/CD34(-) sortable cells that is highly enriched in
bona fide reprogramming progenitors. Transcriptional profiling confirmed that
these progenitors are ERR<U+03B3> and PGC-1ß positive and have undergone extensive
metabolic reprogramming. These studies characterize a previously unrecognized,
ERR-dependent metabolic gate prior to establishment of induced pluripotency.

Neurons utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to generate
energy essential for survival, function, and behavioral output. Unlike most cells
that burn both fat and sugar, neurons only burn sugar. Despite its importance,
how neurons meet the increased energy demands of complex behaviors such as
learning and memory is poorly understood. Here we show that the estrogen-related 
receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) orchestrates the expression of a distinct neural gene
network promoting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that reflects the
extraordinary neuronal dependence on glucose. ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) neurons exhibit decreased
metabolic capacity. Impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in ERR<U+03B3>(-/-)
hippocampal slices can be fully rescued by the mitochondrial OxPhos substrate
pyruvate, functionally linking the ERR<U+03B3> knockout metabolic phenotype and memory
formation. Consistent with this notion, mice lacking neuronal ERR<U+03B3> in cerebral
cortex and hippocampus exhibit defects in spatial learning and memory. These
findings implicate neuronal ERR<U+03B3> in the metabolic adaptations required for memory
formation.

caspase-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells through inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR
signaling.

Coumarins are a large family of compounds derived from a wide range of plants,
fungi, and bacteria, and coumarin derivatives can have extremely variable
structures and consequently diverse biological properties including antitumor
activity. Compounds that bear a benzimidazole moiety are known to possess
antitumor activity and a variety of other biological activities. High-throughput 
screening of a compound library identified a coumarin-containing and a
benzimidazole-containing compound [#32,
7-(diethylamino)-3-(1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2H-chromen-2-one] that has
potent anticancer activity. Evaluation of 17 additional analogs further
identified three compounds with anticancer activity in 14 different human cancer 
cell lines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and western blotting analyses
suggested that these compounds can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. Real-time 
reverse transcriptase PCR analyses of 26 cancer-related genes revealed that seven
genes (NPPB, ATF3, DDIT4, CDH10, TSPAN14, TXNIP, and AXL) were significantly
upregulated and nine genes (PAGE4, LRP8, SNCAIP, IGFBP5, SLCO2A1, CLDN2, ESRRG,
D2HGDH, and PDGFRA) were significantly downregulated. The most upregulated gene
is natriuretic peptide precursor B (NPPB) or brain natriuretic peptide, which is 
increased by 7-, 27-, and 197-fold at 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. The second 
most upregulated gene is ATF3, which is increased by 23-fold at the 48 h
timepoint. PAGE4 and IGFBP5 are the two most downregulated genes, with a 17-fold 
reduction in both genes. The expression of several genes (DDIT4, PDGFRA, LRP8,
IGFBP5) and western blotting data on key signaling proteins indicate that
compound #32 significantly inhibits the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, an intracellular
signaling pathway critical in cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor relevant to the
development of many mammalian organs including the brain. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which signaling events mediate neuronal differentiation have not
been fully elucidated. In the present study, we show for the first time that the 
orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is upregulated by
HIF-1a and plays essential roles in HIF-1a-induced upregulation of dopaminergic
marker molecules such as tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter. We found 
that deferoxamine upregulated HIF-1a and enhanced the dopaminergic phenotype and 
neurite outgrowth of SH-SY5Y cells. Deferoxamine activated transcription and
protein expression of ERR<U+03B3>, and deferoxamine-induced upregulation of tyrosine
hydroxylase and dopamine transporter was attenuated by using the ERR<U+03B3> inverse
agonist or silencing ERR<U+03B3>. Altogether, these results suggest that HIF-1a can
positively regulate the dopaminergic phenotype through ERR<U+03B3>. This study could
provide new perspectives for understanding the mechanisms underlying the
promotion of dopaminergic neuronal differentiation by hypoxia.

Bisphenol A (BPA) can interact with nuclear receptors and affect the normal
function of nuclear receptors in very low doses, which causes BPA to be one of
the most controversial endocrine disruptors. However, the detailed molecular
mechanism about how BPA interferes the normal function of nuclear receptors is
still undiscovered. Herein, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to
explore the detailed interaction mechanism between BPA with three typical nuclear
receptors, including hERa, hERR<U+03B3> and hPPAR<U+03B3>. The simulation results and
calculated binding free energies indicate that BPA can bind to these three
nuclear receptors. The binding affinities of BPA were slightly lower than that of
E2 to these three receptors. The simulation results proved that the binding
process was mainly driven by direct hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions.
In addition, structural analysis suggested that BPA could interact with these
nuclear receptors by mimicking the action of natural hormone and keeping the
nuclear receptors in active conformations. The present work provided the
structural evidence to recognize BPA as an endocrine disruptor and would be
important guidance for seeking safer substitutions of BPA.

Ischemic retinopathies causing overexpression of pro-angiogenic factors,
including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are the most common cause of
blindness. Thus, understanding the pathophysiology of targetable pathways that
regulate retinal VEGF is of great interest. A conserved binding site for
estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) has been identified in the promoter of the
Vegfa gene. ERR<U+03B3> is a constitutively active orphan nuclear receptor and its
expression is increased by hypoxic stimuli in metabolically active tissues. This 
study evaluated the role of ERR<U+03B3> in the ischemic retina and the anti-VEGF
potential of GSK5182, a selective inverse agonist of ERR<U+03B3>. In an oxygen-induced
retinopathy (OIR) mouse model, immunohistochemistry showed significantly
increased ERR<U+03B3> expression in the ganglion cell layer at postnatal day (P) 17. In 
a ganglion cell line (RGC-5), mRNA and protein levels of ERR<U+03B3> were increased by
desferrioxamine treatment and hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Transient transfection 
of RGC-5 cells revealed that ERR<U+03B3> regulated Vegfa expression and this was
inhibited by GSK5182. Intravitreal injection of GSK5182 into the OIR model at P14
inhibited retinal Vegfa mRNA expression at P17. GSK5182 suppresses
hypoxia-induced VEGF expression via ERR<U+03B3>; therefore, ERR<U+03B3> could be a treatment
target for ischemic retinopathies.

Tamoxifen (Tam) is the only FDA-approved chemoprevention agent for pre-menopausal
women at high risk for developing breast cancer. While Tam reduces a woman's risk
of developing estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, the molecular
mechanisms associated with risk reduction are poorly understood. Prior studies
have shown that cytoplasmic proline, glutamic acid and leucine rich protein 1
(PELP1) promotes Tam resistance in breast cancer cell lines. Herein, we tested
for PELP1 localization in breast epithelial cells from women at high risk for
developing breast cancer and found that PELP1 was localized to the cytoplasm in
36% of samples. In vitro, immortalized HMECs expressing a nuclear localization
signal (NLS) mutant of PELP1 (PELP1-cyto) were resistant to Tam-induced death.
Furthermore, PELP1-cyto signaling through estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) 
promoted cell survival in the presence of Tam. Overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> in
immortalized HMECs protected cells from Tam-induced death, while knockdown of
ERR<U+03B3> sensitized PELP1-cyto expressing HMECs to Tam. Moreover, Tam-induced HMEC
cell death was independent of apoptosis and involved accumulation of the
autophagy marker LC3-II. Expression of PELP1-cyto and ERR<U+03B3> reduced Tam-induced
LC3-II accumulation, and knockdown of ERR<U+03B3> increased LC3-II levels in response to
Tam. Additionally, PELP1-cyto expression led to the upregulation of MMP-3 and
MAOB, known PELP1 and ERR<U+03B3> target genes, respectively. Our data indicate that
cytoplasmic PELP1 induces signaling pathways that converge on ERR<U+03B3> to promote
cell survival in the presence of Tam. These data suggest that PELP1 localization 
and/or ERR<U+03B3> activation could be developed as tissue biomarkers for Tam
responsiveness.

Tamoxifen represents a major adjuvant therapy to those patients with estrogen
receptor-alpha positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen resistance occurs quite
often, either de novo or acquired during treatment. To investigate the role of
miR-320a in the development of resistance to tamoxifen, we established
tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) models by continually exposing MCF-7 or T47D breast
cancer cells to tamoxifen, and identified microRNA(miRNA)-320a as a
down-regulated miRNA in tamoxifen resistant cells. Re-expression of miR-320a was 
sufficient to sensitize TamR cells to tamoxifen by targeting cAMP-regulated
phosphoprotein (ARPP-19) and estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) as well as
their downstream effectors, c-Myc and Cyclin D1. Furthermore, progesterone (P4)
promoted the expression of miR-320a by repressing c-Myc expression, while
estrogen (E2) exerted the opposite effect. These results suggest the potential
therapeutic approach for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer by restorating
miR-320a expression or depleting ARPP-19/ERR<U+03B3> expression.

Estrogen-related receptor gamma regulates dopaminergic neuronal phenotype by
activating GSK3ß/NFAT signaling in SH-SY5Y cells.

The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) is highly
expressed in the nervous system during embryogenesis and in adult brains, but its
physiological role in neuronal development remains unknown. In this study, we
evaluated the relevance of ERR<U+03B3> in regulating dopaminergic (DAergic) phenotype
and the corresponding signaling pathway. We used retinoic acid (RA) to
differentiate human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. RA induced neurite outgrowth of 
SH-SY5Y cells with an increase in DAergic neuron-like properties, including
up-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular
monoamine transporter 2. ERR<U+03B3>, but not ERRa, was up-regulated by RA, and
participated in RA effect on SH-SY5Y cells. ERR<U+03B3> over-expression enhanced mature 
DAergic neuronal phenotype with neurite outgrowth as with RA treatment; and
RA-induced increase in DAergic phenotype was attenuated by silencing ERR<U+03B3>
expression. ERR<U+03B3> appears to have a crucial role in morphological and functional
regulation of cells that is selective for DAergic neurons. Polo-like kinase 2 was
up-regulated in ERR<U+03B3>-over-expressing SH-SY5Y cells, which was involved in
phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3ß and resulting downstream
activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. The likely involvement of ERR<U+03B3>
in regulating the DAergic neuronal phenotype makes this orphan nuclear receptor a
novel target for understanding DAergic neuronal differentiation. We propose the
relevance of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) in regulating dopaminergic
neuronal phenotype: ERR<U+03B3> is up-regulated by retinoic acid in SH-SY5Y cells, and
enhances dopaminergic phenotypes and induces neurite outgrowth; Polo-like kinase 
2 (PLK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/nuclear factor of activated T cells 
(GSK3ß/NFAT) signaling are responsible for the ERR<U+03B3> effect. Our findings provide 
the first insights into the role of ERR<U+03B3> in the brain, as a novel approach toward
understanding dopaminergic differentiation.

Almost all cellular functions are powered by a continuous energy supply derived
from cellular metabolism. However, it is little understood how cellular energy
production is coordinated with diverse energy-consuming cellular functions. Here,
using the cardiac muscle system, we demonstrate that nuclear receptors
estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa) and ERR<U+03B3> are essential transcriptional
coordinators of cardiac energy production and consumption. On the one hand, ERRa 
and ERR<U+03B3> together are vital for intact cardiomyocyte metabolism by directly
controlling expression of genes important for mitochondrial functions and
dynamics. On the other hand, ERRa and ERR<U+03B3> influence major cardiomyocyte energy
consumption functions through direct transcriptional regulation of key
contraction, calcium homeostasis, and conduction genes. Mice lacking both ERRa
and cardiac ERR<U+03B3> develop severe bradycardia, lethal cardiomyopathy, and heart
failure featuring metabolic, contractile, and conduction dysfunctions. These
results illustrate that the ERR transcriptional pathway is essential to couple
cellular energy metabolism with energy consumption processes in order to maintain
normal cardiac function.

BACKGROUND: Renal aging is characterized by functional and structural changes
like decreased glomerular filtration rate, and glomerular, tubular and
interstitial damage. To gain insight in pathways involved in renal aging, we
studied aged mouse strains and used genetic analysis to identify genes associated
with aging phenotypes.
METHODS: Upon morphological screening in kidneys from 20-month-old mice from 26
inbred strains we noted intracapillary PAS-positive deposits. The severity of
these deposits was quantified by scoring of a total of 50 glomeruli per section
(grade 0-4). Electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining for apoE, apoB,
apoA-IV and perilipin-2 was performed to further characterize the lesions. To
identify loci associated with these PAS-positive intracapillary glomerular
deposits, we performed haplotype association mapping.
RESULTS: Six out of 26 mouse strains showed glomerular PAS-positive deposits. The
severity of these deposits varied: NOD(0.97), NZW(0.41), NON(0.30), B10(0.21), C3
H(0.9) and C57BR(0.7). The intracapillary deposits were strongly positive for
apoE and weakly positive for apoB and apoA-IV. Haplotype association mapping
showed a strong association with a 30-Kb haplotype block on Chr 1 within the
Esrrg gene. We investigated 1 Mb on each site of this region, which includes the 
genes Spata17, Gpatch2, Esrrg, Ush2a and Kctd3.
CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing 26 aged mouse strains we found that some strains
developed an intracapillary PAS and apoE-positive lesion and identified a small
haplotype block on Chr 1 within the Esrrg gene to be associated with these
lipoprotein deposits. The region spanning this haplotype block contains the genes
Spata17, Gpatch2, Esrrg, Ush2a and Kctd3, which are all highly expressed in the
kidney. Esrrg might be involved in the evolvement of these glomerular deposits by
influencing lipid metabolism and possibly immune reponses.

To assess the effects of the orphan nuclear Estrogen receptor-related receptor
gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) deficiency on skeletal development and bone turnover, we utilized an
ERR<U+03B3> global knockout mouse line. While we observed no gross morphological
anomalies or difference in skeletal length in newborn mice, by 8 weeks of age
ERR<U+03B3> +/- males but not females exhibited increased trabecular bone, which was
further increased by 14 weeks. The increase in trabecular bone was due to an
increase in active osteoblasts on the bone surface, without detectable
alterations in osteoclast number or activity. Consistent with the
histomorphometric results, we observed an increase in gene expression of the bone
formation markers alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and bone sialoprotein (Bsp) in bone 
and increase in serum ALP, but no change in the osteoclast regulators receptor
activator of NF-<U+03BA>B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) or the resorption
marker carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX). More colony forming
units-alkaline phosphatase and -osteoblast (CFU-ALP, CFU-O respectively) but not 
CFU-fibroblast (CFU-F) formed in ERR<U+03B3> +/- versus ERR<U+03B3> +/+ stromal cell cultures, 
suggesting that ERR<U+03B3> negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and matrix
mineralization but not mesenchymal precursor number. By co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, we found that ERR<U+03B3> and RUNX2 interact in an ERR<U+03B3> DNA binding domain 
(DBD)-dependent manner. Treatment of post-confluent differentiating bone marrow
stromal cell cultures with Runx2 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a
reduction of CFU-ALP/CFU-O in ERR<U+03B3> +/- but not ERR<U+03B3> +/+ mice compared to their
corresponding sense controls. Our data indicate that ERR<U+03B3> is not required for
skeletal development but is a sex-dependent negative regulator of postnatal bone 
formation, acting in a RUNX2- and apparently differentiation stage-dependent
manner.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have shown several long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) play various roles in HCC progression, but no research has focused on
the expression pattern of microRNA clusters encoded in lncRNAs. The Ftx gene
encodes a lncRNA which harbors 2 clusters of microRNAs in its introns, the
miR-374b/421 cluster and the miR-545/374a cluster. To date, no research has
focused on the role of the miR-545/374a and miR-374b/421 clusters in HBV-related 
HCC. In this study, 66 pairs of HBV-related HCC tissue and matched non-cancerous 
liver tissue specimens were analyzed for the expression of the Ftx microRNA
clusters. Our results showed that the miR-545/374a cluster was upregulated in
HBV-HCC tissue and significantly correlated with prognosis-related clinical
features, including histological grade, metastasis and tumor capsule.
Transfection studies with microRNA mimics and inhibitors revealed that
miR-545/374a expression promoted in vitro cell proliferation, cell migration and 
invasion. The wild-type HBV-genome-containing plasmid or full-length HBx protein 
encoding plasmid was transfected into the Bel-7402 cell line and observed for
their influence on miR-545/374a expression. We found that transfection of the HBV
genome or HBx alone resulted in an increase in miR-545/374a expression. Next, by 
monitoring the expression of sera miR-545/374a before and after surgical tumor
excision, we found serum miR-545/374a was tumor-derived and exhibited a sharp
decrease 25 days after tumor excision. We also examined the gender-based
difference in miR-545/374a expression among HCC patients and utilized microRNA
target prediction software to find the targets of miR-545/374a. One of these
targets, namely estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG) was inversely correlated 
with miR-545 expression. In conclusion, the overexpression of miR-545/374a
cluster located in the Ftx lncRNA is partially responsible for a poor prognosis, 
and monitoring sera levels of miR-545/374a may be a useful diagnostic marker for 
HCC.

INTRODUCTION: The dysregulation of maternal-fetal immune tolerance is one of the 
proposed mechanisms leading to preeclampsia. Galectins are key regulator proteins
of the immune response in vertebrates and maternal-fetal immune tolerance in
eutherian mammals. Previously we found that three genes in a Chr19 cluster
encoding for human placental galectin-13 (PP13), galectin-14 and galectin-16
emerged during primate evolution and may confer immune tolerance to the
semi-allogeneic fetus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved various methodologies for gene and
protein expression profiling, genomic DNA methylation analyses, functional assays
on differentiating trophoblasts including gene silencing, luciferase reporter and
methylation assays. These methods were applied on placental specimens, umbilical 
cord blood cells, primary trophoblasts and BeWo cells. Genomic DNA sequences were
analyzed for transposable elements, transcription factor binding sites and
evolutionary conservation.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The villous trophoblastic expression of Chr19 cluster
galectin genes is developmentally regulated by DNA methylation and induced by key
transcription factors of villous placental development during trophoblast fusion 
and differentiation. This latter mechanism arose via the co-option of binding
sites for these transcription factors through promoter evolution and the
insertion of an anthropoid-specific L1PREC2 transposable element into the 5'
untranslated region of an ancestral gene followed by gene duplication events.
Among placental Chr19 cluster galectin genes, the expression of LGALS13 and
LGALS14 is down-regulated in preterm severe preeclampsia associated with SGA. We 
reveal that this phenomenon is partly originated from the dysregulated expression
of key transcription factors controlling trophoblastic functions and galectin
gene expression. In addition, the differential DNA methylation of these genes was
also observed in preterm preeclampsia irrespective of SGA.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the evolutionary origins of the placental
expression of Chr19 cluster galectins. The complex dysregulation of these genes
in preeclampsia may alter immune tolerance mechanisms at the maternal-fetal
interface.

As bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to induce adverse effects on human health,
especially through the activation of endocrine pathways, it is about to be
withdrawn from the European market and replaced by analogues such as bisphenol S 
(BPS). However, toxicological data on BPS is scarce, and so it is necessary to
evaluate the possible effects of this compound on human health. We compared the
effect of BPA and BPS on obesity and hepatic steatosis processes using low doses 
in the same range as those found in the environment. Two in vitro models were
used, the adipose cell line 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells, representative of hepatic
functions. We analyzed different parameters such as lipid and glucose uptakes,
lipolysis, leptin production and the modulation of genes involved in lipid
metabolism and energy balance. BPA and BPS induced an increase in the lipid
content in the 3T3-L1 cell line and more moderately in the hepatic cells. We also
observed a decrease in lipolysis after bisphenol treatment of adipocytes, but
only BPS was involved in the increase in glucose uptake and leptin production.
These latter effects could be linked to the modulation of SREBP-1c, PPAR<U+03B3>, aP2
and ERRa and <U+03B3> genes after exposure to BPA, whereas BPS seems to target the PGC1a
and the ERR<U+03B3> genes. The findings suggest that both BPA and BPS could be involved 
in obesity and steatosis processes, but through two different metabolic pathways.

Bisphenol-A (4,4'-dihydroxy-2,2-diphenylpropane, BPA, or BPA-A) and its
derivatives, when exposed to humans, may affect functions of multiple organs by
specific binding to the human estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>). We carried out 
atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of three ligand compounds including
BPA-A, 4-a-cumylphenol (BPA-C), and 2,2-diphenylpropane (BPA-D) binding to the
ligand binding domain (LBD) of a human ERR<U+03B3> to study the structures and energies 
associated with the binding. We used the implicit Molecular
Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method to estimate the free
energies of binding for the phenyl based compound/ERR<U+03B3> systems. The addition of
hydroxyl groups to the aromatic ring had only a minor effect on binding
structures and a significant effect on ligand/protein binding energy in an
aqueous solution. Free binding energies of BPA-D to the ERR<U+03B3> were found to be
considerably less than those of BPA-A and BPA-C to the ERR<U+03B3>. These results are
well correlated with those from experiments where no binding affinities were
determined in the BPA-D/ERR<U+03B3> complex. No conformational change was observed for
the helix 12 (H-12) of ERR<U+03B3> upon binding of these compounds preserving an active 
transcriptional conformation state.

The coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 a 
(PGC-1a) is widely considered a central transcriptional regulator of adaptive
thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, mice lacking PGC-1a
specifically in adipose tissue have only mild thermogenic defects, suggesting the
presence of additional regulators. Using the activity of estrogen-related
receptors (ERRs), downstream effectors of PGC-1a, as read-out in a
high-throughput genome-wide cDNA screen, we identify here growth arrest and
DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 <U+03B3> (GADD45<U+03B3>) as a cold-induced activator of
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and oxidative capacity in BAT. Mice lacking Gadd45<U+03B3>
have defects in Ucp1 induction and the thermogenic response to cold. GADD45<U+03B3>
works by activating MAPK p38, which is a potent activator of ERRß and ERR<U+03B3>
transcriptional function. GADD45<U+03B3> activates ERR<U+03B3> independently of PGC-1
coactivators, yet synergizes with PGC-1a to induce the thermogenic program. Our
findings elucidate a previously unidentified GADD45<U+03B3>/p38/ERR<U+03B3> pathway that
regulates BAT thermogenesis and may enable new approaches for the stimulation of 
energy expenditure. Our study also implicates GADD45 proteins as general
metabolic regulators.

The effect of estrogen on the proliferation of endometrial cancer cells is
mediated by ERR<U+03B3> through AKT and ERK1/2.

The objective of this study was to explore the effects and underlying mechanism
of estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) on the proliferation of endometrial
carcinoma cells. Ishikawa cells, human endometrial cancer cells, were treated
with estrogen. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the expression of ERR<U+03B3>.
Stable transfection with the plasmid containing ERR<U+03B3> shRNA was carried out to
knock down the expression of ERR<U+03B3> in Ishikawa cells. MTT assays were performed to
analyze the proliferation of Ishikawa cells. The activation of extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 and activated protein kinase B (AKT)
signaling pathways was identified using specific phosphorylated antibodies
against ERK1/2 and AKT. PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, and LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor,
were used in the inhibition experiments. ERR<U+03B3> could translocate from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus in Ishikawa cells after exposure to estrogen. Knockdown 
of ERR<U+03B3> inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of Ishikawa cells. More
interestingly, knockdown of ERR<U+03B3> abolished the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT in
the Ishikawa cells treated with estrogen. Inhibition of AKT in Ishikawa cells
with LY294002 resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of
phospho-ERK1/2, whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 with PD98059 exerted no effects on
AKT activation. Our data showed that ERR<U+03B3> mediated the effects of estrogen on the
proliferation of endometrial cancer cells through the activation AKT and ERK1/2
signaling pathways, which indicated that ERR<U+03B3> plays a key role in endometrial
cancer.

Parabens can enable hallmarks and characteristics of cancer in human breast
epithelial cells: a review of the literature with reference to new exposure data 
and regulatory status.

(1)School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, RG6 6UB, UK.

A framework for understanding the complexity of cancer development was
established by Hanahan and Weinberg in their definition of the hallmarks of
cancer. In this review, we consider the evidence that parabens can enable
development in human breast epithelial cells of four of six of the basic
hallmarks, one of two of the emerging hallmarks and one of two of the enabling
characteristics. In Hallmark 1, parabens have been measured as present in 99% of 
human breast tissue samples, possess oestrogenic activity and can stimulate
sustained proliferation of human breast cancer cells at concentrations measurable
in the breast. In Hallmark 2, parabens can inhibit the suppression of breast
cancer cell growth by hydroxytamoxifen, and through binding to the
oestrogen-related receptor gamma may prevent its deactivation by growth
inhibitors. In Hallmark 3, in the 10 nm-1 µm range, parabens give a
dose-dependent evasion of apoptosis in high-risk donor breast epithelial cells.
In Hallmark 4, long-term exposure (>20 weeks) to parabens leads to increased
migratory and invasive activity in human breast cancer cells, properties that are
linked to the metastatic process. As an emerging hallmark methylparaben has been 
shown in human breast epithelial cells to increase mTOR, a key regulator of
energy metabolism. As an enabling characteristic parabens can cause DNA damage at
high concentrations in the short term but more work is needed to investigate
long-term, low-dose mixtures. The ability of parabens to enable multiple cancer
hallmarks in human breast epithelial cells provides grounds for regulatory review
of the implications of the presence of parabens in human breast tissue.

The endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) affects various genes and hormones even
at merely physiological levels. We recently demonstrated that BPA binds strongly 
to human nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor (ERR) <U+03B3> and that the phenol-A
group of BPA is in a receptacle pocket with essential amino acid residues to
provide structural support at the backside. This led BPA to bind to ERR<U+03B3> in an
induced-fit-type binding mode, for example, with a rotated motion of Val313 to
support the Tyr326-binding site. A similar binding mechanism appears to occur at 
the binding site of the BPA phenol-B ring. X-ray crystal analysis of the
ERR<U+03B3>-ligand-binding domain/BPA complex suggested that the ERR<U+03B3> receptor residues 
Leu342, Leu345, Asn346, and Ile349 function as intrinsic binding sites of the BPA
phenol-B, whereas Leu265, Leu268, Ile310, Val313, Leu324, Tyr330, Lys430, Ala431,
and His434 work as structural elements to assist these binding sites. In the
present study, by evaluating the mutant receptors replaced by a series of amino
acids, we demonstrated that a finely assembled structural network indeed exists
around the two adjacent Leu342-Asn346 and Leu345-Ile349 ridges on the same
a-helix 7 (H7), constructing a part of the binding pocket structure with back
support residues for the BPA phenol-B ring. The results reveal that the
double-layer binding sites, namely, the ordinary ligand binding sites and their
back support residues, substantiate the strong binding of BPA to ERR<U+03B3>. When
ERR<U+03B3>-Asn346 was replaced by the corresponding Gly and Tyr in ERRa and ERRß,
respectively, the binding affinity of BPA and even 4-hydroxytamxifen (4-OHT) is
much reduced. Asn346 was found to be one of the residues that make ERR<U+03B3> to be
exclusive to BPA.

This study examined the effects of exposure to low concentrations (0.1-100 nM) of
bisphenol A (BPA) or nonylphenol (NP) on neuronal differentiation in
pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Pre-exposure to BPA for a week or a month, but not
for a day, decreased neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. Likewise, one week's
pre-exposure to NP also inhibited neuronal differentiation in these cells. The
inhibitory effects were still observed when PC12 cells were treated with BPA or
NP for a week, followed by a week's withdrawal. These findings suggest that
long-term exposure of PC12 cells to low concentrations of BPA or NP leads to
changes in the cellular machinery responsible for neuronal differentiation, and
these changes might be retained within PC12 cells.

Persistent hypoxia caused by shallow trophoblast invasion and poor placental
perfusion may underlie the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, a leading cause of
maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Previously, we found that
estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) serves a critical and O2-dependent role in
differentiation of human trophoblasts in culture and expression of tissue
kallikrein and voltage-gated K(+) channels. In this study, we surprisingly
observed that ERR<U+03B3> expression was significantly increased in placentas from
preeclamptic women compared with that in gestation-matched normotensive women. To
further investigate a functional role for ERR<U+03B3> during pregnancy, we analyzed
ERR<U+03B3>-deficient mice. Maternal systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced
in pregnant ERR<U+03B3>(+/-) females bred to ERR<U+03B3>(+/-) males compared with that in
wild-type (WT) mice and was markedly up-regulated by treatment of WT pregnant
mice with the ERR<U+03B3> agonist DY131. Placentas of ERR<U+03B3>(+/-) mice manifested
increased vascular endothelial growth factor A expression compared with that in
WT mice. Notably, circulating levels of the antiangiogenic factor, soluble
fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, were significantly reduced in ERR<U+03B3>(+/-) pregnant mice
as was serum aldosterone. These effects were associated with a decrease in
maternal adrenal Cyp11b1 (steroid 11ß-hydroxylase) and Cyp11b2 (aldosterone
synthase) expression. In contrast, adrenal Cyp11b1 and Cyp11b2 mRNA were
increased in pregnant WT mice treated with DY131. Moreover, chromatin
immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified Cyp11b2 as a
transcriptional target of ERR<U+03B3>. Collectively, these findings reveal a potential
role of ERR<U+03B3> in maternal blood pressure homeostasis during pregnancy and suggest 
that aberrant ERR<U+03B3> expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

AIMS: Oestrogen has been speculated to play an important role in the pathogenesis
of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which mainly affects middle-aged and old-aged
females because biliary epithelial cells (BECs) are known to express oestrogen
receptors (ERs). Oestrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are constitutively active
without oestrogen and competitively inhibit the ER-dependent effects of
oestrogen. We clarified the effects of oestrogen and the significance of ERRs
along with their association with the pathogenesis of cholangiopathy in PBC.
METHODS: We investigated the expression of ERs and ERRs and the apoptosis-related
cell kinetics in BECs using cultured human BECs and human liver specimens.
RESULTS: Although cultured human BECs and the interlobular bile ducts in the
liver expressed ERß, in cultured BECs, oestrogen treatment did not induce
significant cell proliferation but increased the expression of a negative cell
proliferation regulator (14-3-3s protein). The cultured BECs constantly expressed
ERRa and ERR<U+03B3>, and oestrogen downregulated the ERR<U+03B3> expression. Furthermore, the 
ERR<U+03B3> expression was determined in the intrahepatic bile ducts and was stronger in
the middle-aged and old-aged females, particularly those with PBC, than in the
younger females. The ERR<U+03B3> ligand activated a transcription factor, SP1, and
enhanced the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family molecules and Bcl-2
inhibitor-induced apoptosis in cultured BECs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although oestrogen downregulates the ERR<U+03B3> expression, the increased 
ERR<U+03B3> expression under oestrogen-deficient conditions increases the susceptibility
to Bcl-2 family-mediated apoptosis in cultured human BECs of females,
particularly those with PBC. Understanding the oestrogen-mediated cell kinetics
is important for elucidating the pathogenesis of cholangiopathy in PBC.

ERK/MAPK regulates ERR<U+03B3> expression, transcriptional activity and
receptor-mediated tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen (TAM) significantly
improve breast cancer-specific survival for women with estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+) disease. However, resistance to TAM remains a major clinical problem. The
resistant phenotype is usually not driven by loss or mutation of the estrogen
receptor; instead, changes in multiple proliferative and/or survival pathways
over-ride the inhibitory effects of TAM. Estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is an
orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that promotes TAM resistance in
ER+ breast cancer cells. This study sought to clarify the mechanism(s) by which
this orphan nuclear receptor is regulated, and hence affects TAM resistance. mRNA
and protein expression/phosphorylation were monitored by RT-PCR and western
blotting, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt consensus
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) target sites. Cell proliferation and 
cell-cycle progression were measured by flow cytometric methods. ERR<U+03B3>
transcriptional activity was assessed by dual-luciferase promoter-reporter
assays. We show that ERR<U+03B3> protein levels are affected by the activation state of 
ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and mutation of consensus ERK target sites 
impairs ERR<U+03B3>-driven transcriptional activity and TAM resistance. These findings
shed new light on the functional significance of ERR<U+03B3> in ER+ breast cancer, and
are the first to demonstrate a role for kinase regulation of this orphan nuclear 
receptor.

In response to microbial infection, expression of the defensin-like peptide
hepcidin (encoded by Hamp) is induced in hepatocytes to decrease iron release
from macrophages. To elucidate the mechanism by which Salmonella enterica var.
Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), an intramacrophage bacterium, alters host iron
metabolism for its own survival, we examined the role of nuclear receptor family 
members belonging to the NR3B subfamily in mouse hepatocytes. Here, we report
that estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>, encoded by Esrrg) modulates the
intramacrophage proliferation of S. typhimurium by altering host iron
homeostasis, and we demonstrate an antimicrobial effect of an ERR<U+03B3> inverse
agonist. Hepatic ERR<U+03B3> expression was induced by S. typhimurium-stimulated
interleukin-6 signaling, resulting in an induction of hepcidin and eventual
hypoferremia in mice. Conversely, ablation of ERR<U+03B3> mRNA expression in liver
attenuated the S. typhimurium-mediated induction of hepcidin and normalized the
hypoferremia caused by S. typhimurium infection. An inverse agonist of ERR<U+03B3>
ameliorated S. typhimurium-mediated hypoferremia through reduction of
ERR<U+03B3>-mediated hepcidin mRNA expression and exerted a potent antimicrobial effect 
on the S. typhimurium infection, thereby improving host survival. Taken together,
these findings suggest an alternative approach to control multidrug-resistant
intracellular bacteria by modulating host iron homeostasis.

The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor-<U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is a
constitutively active transcription factor regulating genes involved in several
important cellular processes, including hepatic glucose metabolism, alcohol
metabolism, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. cAMP responsive
element-binding protein H (CREBH) is an ER-bound bZIP family transcription factor
that is activated upon ER stress and regulates genes encoding acute-phase
proteins whose expression is increased in response to inflammation. Here, we
report that ERR<U+03B3> directly regulates CREBH gene expression in response to ER
stress. ERR<U+03B3> bound to the ERR<U+03B3> response element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter.
Overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> by adenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH 
as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown of ERR<U+03B3> or
inhibition of ERR<U+03B3> by ERR<U+03B3> specific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially
inhibited ER stress-mediated induction of CREBH and CRP. The transcriptional
coactivator PGC1a was required for ERR<U+03B3> mediated induction of the CREBH gene as
demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of
both ERR<U+03B3> and PGC1a on the CREBH promoter. The ChIP assay also revealed that
histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred at the ERR<U+03B3> and PGC1a binding site.
Moreover, chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis, as well as the diabetic obese
condition significantly increased CRP gene expression, and this increase was
significantly attenuated by GSK5182 treatment. We suggest that orphan nuclear
receptor ERR<U+03B3> directly regulates the ER-bound transcription factor CREBH in
response to ER stress and other metabolic conditions.

BACKGROUND: miRNAs are proved to have causal roles in tumorgenesis involving
various types of human cancers, but the mechanism is not clear. We aimed to
explore the effect of miRNAs on the development of ovarian cancer and the
underlying mechanism.
METHODS: The miRNA expression profile GSE31801 was downloaded from GEO (Gene
Expression Omnibus) database. Firstly, the differentially expressed miRNAs were
screened. Target genes of the miRNAs were collected from TargetScan, PicTar,
miRanda, and DIANA-microT database, then the miRNA-miRNA co-regulating network
was constructed using miRNA pairs with common regulated target genes. Next, the
functional modules in the network were studied, the miRNA pairs regulated at
least one modules were enriched to form the miRNA functional synergistic network 
(MFSN).
RESULTS: Risk miRNA were selected in MFSN according to the topological structure.
Transcript factors (TFs) in MFSN were identified, followed by the
miRNA-transcript factor networks construction. Totally, 42 up- and 61
down-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 68
formed 2292 miRNA pairs in the miRNA-miRNA co-regulating network. GO: 0007268
(synaptic transmission) and GO: 0019226 (transmission of nerve impulse) were the 
two common functions of miRNAs in MFSN, and hsa-miR-579 (36), hsa-miR-942 (31),
hsa-miR-105 (31), hsa-miR-150 (34), and hsa-miR-27a* (32) were selected as the
hub nodes in MFSN.
CONCLUSIONS: In all, 17 TFs, including CREM, ERG, and CREB1 were screened as the 
cancer related TFs in MFSN. Other TFs, such as BIN1, FOXN3, FOXK1, FOXP2, and
ESRRG with high degrees may be inhibited in ovarian cancer. MFSN gave us a new
shed light on the mechanism studies in ovarian cancer.

Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for hypertension, with recent
candidate studies implicating gene-alcohol interactions in blood pressure (BP)
regulation. We used 6882 (predominantly) Caucasian participants aged 20-80 years 
from the Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) to perform a
genome-wide analysis of SNP-alcohol interactions on BP traits. We used a two-step
approach in the ABEL suite to examine genetic interactions with three alcohol
measures (ounces of alcohol consumed per week, drinks consumed per week, and the 
number of days drinking alcohol per week) on four BP traits [systolic (SBP),
diastolic (DBP), mean arterial (MAP), and pulse (PP) pressure]. In the first
step, we fit a linear mixed model of each BP trait onto age, sex, BMI, and
antihypertensive medication while accounting for the phenotypic correlation among
relatives. In the second step, we conducted 1 degree-of-freedom (df) score tests 
of the SNP main effect, alcohol main effect, and SNP-alcohol interaction using
the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameters from the first step. We 
then calculated the joint 2 df score test of the SNP main effect and SNP-alcohol 
interaction using MixABEL. The effect of SNP rs10826334 (near SLC16A9) on SBP was
significantly modulated by both the number of alcoholic drinks and the ounces of 
alcohol consumed per week (p-values of 1.27E-08 and 3.92E-08, respectively). Each
copy of the G-allele decreased SBP by 3.79 mmHg in those consuming 14 drinks per 
week vs. a 0.461 mmHg decrease in non-drinkers. Index SNPs in 20 other loci
exhibited suggestive (p-value = 1E-06) associations with BP traits by the 1 df
interaction test or joint 2 df test, including 3 rare variants, one low-frequency
variant, and SNPs near/in genes ESRRG, FAM179A, CRIPT-SOCS5, KAT2B, ADCY2, GLI3, 
ZNF716, SLIT1, PDE3A, KERA-LUM, RNF219-AS1, CLEC3A, FBXO15, and IGSF5.
SNP-alcohol interactions may enhance discovery of novel variants with large
effects that can be targeted with lifestyle modifications.

The aim of the present study was to scrutinise the influence of maternal high-fat
diet (mHFD) consumption during gestation and lactation on exercise performance
and energy metabolism in male mouse offspring. Female C3H/HeJ mice were fed
either a semi-synthetic high-fat diet (HFD; 40 % energy from fat) or a low-fat
diet (LFD; 10 % energy from fat) throughout gestation and lactation. After
weaning, male offspring of both groups received the LFD. At the age of 7·5 weeks 
half of the maternal LFD (n 20) and the mHFD (n 21) groups were given access to a
running wheel for 28 d as a voluntary exercise training opportunity. We show that
mHFD consumption led to a significantly reduced exercise performance (P < 0·05)
and training efficiency (P < 0·05) in male offspring. There were no effects of
maternal diet on offspring body weight. Lipid and glucose metabolism was
disturbed in mHFD offspring, with altered regulation of cluster of
differentiation 36 (CD36) (P < 0·001), fatty acid synthase (P < 0·05) and GLUT1
(P < 0·05) gene expression in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, maternal
consumption of a HFD is linked to decreased exercise performance and training
efficiency in the offspring. We speculate that this may be due to insufficient
muscle energy supply during prolonged exercise training. Further, this
compromised exercise performance might increase the risk of obesity development
in adult life.

The pERK of being a target: Kinase regulation of the orphan nuclear receptor
ERR<U+03B3>.

Riggins RB(1).

University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057 USA.

Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are orphan members of the nuclear receptor
superfamily that are important regulators of mitochondrial metabolism with
emerging roles in cancer. In the absence of an endogenous ligand, ERRs are
reliant upon other regulatory mechanisms that include protein/protein
interactions and post-translational modification, though the cellular and
clinical significance of this latter mechanism is unclear. We recently published 
a study in which we establish estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) as a target 
for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and show that regulation of ERR<U+03B3>
by ERK has important consequences for the function of this receptor in cellular
models of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. In this Research
Highlight, we discuss the implications of these findings from a molecular and
clinical perspective.

While the role of estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRa) in
chondrogenesis has been investigated, the involvement of ERR gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) has not
been determined. To assess the effect of increased ERR<U+03B3> activity on cartilage
development in vivo, we generated two transgenic (Tg) lines overexpressing ERR<U+03B3>2 
via a chondrocyte-specific promoter; the two lines exhibited ~3 and ~5 fold
increased ERR<U+03B3>2 protein expression respectively in E14.5 Tg versus wild type (WT)
limbs. On postnatal day seven (P7), we observed a 4-10% reduction in the size of 
the craniofacial, axial and appendicular skeletons in Tg versus WT mice. The
reduction in bone length was already present at birth and did not appear to
involve bones that are derived via intramembranous bone formation as the bones of
the calvaria, clavicle, and the mandible developed normally. Histological
analysis of P7 growth plates revealed a reduction in the length of the Tg versus 
WT growth plate, the majority of which was attributable to a reduced
proliferative zone. The reduced proliferative zone paralleled a decrease in the
number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells, with no significant change in
apoptosis, and was accompanied by large cell-free swaths of cartilage matrix,
which extended through multiple zones of the growth plate. Using a bioinformatics
approach, we identified known chondrogenesis-associated genes with at least one
predicted ERR binding site in their proximal promoters, as well as cell cycle
regulators known to be regulated by ERR<U+03B3>. Of the genes identified, Col2al, Agg,
Pth1r, and Cdkn1b (p27) were significantly upregulated, suggesting that ERR<U+03B3>2
negatively regulates chondrocyte proliferation and positively regulates matrix
synthesis to coordinate growth plate height and organization.

Direct reprogramming of adult somatic cells into alternative cell types has been 
shown for several lineages. We previously showed that GATA4, MEF2C, and TBX5
(GMT) directly reprogrammed nonmyocyte mouse heart cells into induced
cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) in vitro and in vivo. However, GMT alone appears 
insufficient in human fibroblasts, at least in vitro. Here, we show that GMT plus
ESRRG and MESP1 induced global cardiac gene-expression and phenotypic shifts in
human fibroblasts derived from embryonic stem cells, fetal heart, and neonatal
skin. Adding Myocardin and ZFPM2 enhanced reprogramming, including sarcomere
formation, calcium transients, and action potentials, although the efficiency
remained low. Human iCM reprogramming was epigenetically stable. Furthermore, we 
found that transforming growth factor ß signaling was important for, and improved
the efficiency of, human iCM reprogramming. These findings demonstrate that human
fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed toward the cardiac lineage, and lay the 
foundation for future refinements in vitro and in vivo.

BACKGROUND: 17a-ethinyl-estradiol (17a-EE), a synthetic estrogen is the world's
most widely and commonly used orally bioactive estrogen. Currently, 17a-EE is in 
use in all formulations of contraceptive pills and is implicated in the
complication of breast cancer. Receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE) is a cell surface immunoglobulin class of molecule. RAGE is involved in
the complication of various cancers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study indicates that treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells with 17a-EE enhances the expression of estrogen receptor related receptor
gamma (ERR<U+03B3>), followed by enhanced level of oxidative stress and subsequent
activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-<U+043A>B), leading
to increase in RAGE expression. RAGE thus expressed by 17a-EE treatment causes
further enhancement of the oxidative stress which, in turn, activates expression 
of cell cycle protein cyclin D1 and subsequent induction of MCF-7 breast cancer
cell proliferation. RAGE also enhanced phosphorylation of prosurvival protein AKT
and increased expression of Bcl2, an antiapoptotic protein.
CONCLUSION: In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, 17a-EE-ERR<U+03B3> interaction induces the
expression of RAGE, which in turn, enhances the number of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells through a multiprong action on the divergent molecules like cyclin D1, AKT 
and Bcl2.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report which explains the intermediate
role of ERR<U+03B3> in the 17a-EE dependent RAGE expression in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells. This report for the first time explains that RAGE is important not only
for MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation but also for its survival and
anti-apoptotic activities.

Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) alpha, beta, and gamma are orphan nuclear
receptors that modulate the estrogen signaling pathway and play roles in the
regulation of breast cancer cell growth. To determine the association between
breast cancer risk and alleles of the tetranucleotide repeat (AAAG)n in the
intron of ERR<U+03B3> gene, a case-control study of 200 breast cancer patients and 200
controls was performed in Iranian women. Our results demonstrate that women with 
short AAAG repeat are at higher risk of breast cancer (OR 7). This result
suggests a possible involvement of polymorphic AAAG repeat of ERR<U+03B3> gene in
regulating its expression.

Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most common pediatric cancers, likely
originating from abnormal development of cerebellar progenitor neurons. MicroRNA 
(miRNA) has been shown to play an important role in the development of the
central nervous system. Microarray analysis was used to investigate miRNA
expression in desmoplastic MB from patients diagnosed at a young age (1 or
2<U+2009>years old). Normal fetal or newborn cerebellum was used as control. A total of 
84 differentially expressed miRNAs (64 downregulated and 20 upregulated) were
found. Most downregulated miRNAs (32/64) were found to belong to the cluster of
miRNAs at the 14q32 locus, suggesting that this miRNA locus is regulated as a
module in MB. Possible mechanisms of 14q32 miRNAs downregulation were
investigated by the analysis of publicly available gene expression data sets.
First, expression of estrogen-related receptor-<U+03B3> (ESRRG), a reported positive
transcriptional regulator of some 14q32 miRNAs, was found downregulated in
desmoplastic MB. Second, expression of the parentally imprinted gene MEG3 was
lower in MB in comparison to normal cerebellum, suggesting a possible epigenetic 
silencing of the 14q32 locus. miR-129-5p (11p11.2/7q32.1), miR-206 (6p12.2), and 
miR-323-3p (14q32.2), were chosen for functional studies in DAOY cells.
Overexpression of miR-129-5p using mimics decreased DAOY proliferation. No effect
was found with miR-206 or miR-323 mimics.

Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has
biological roles mainly in metabolism and that controls metabolic switching in
perinatal heart. In adult heart diseases, however, the functional roles of ERR<U+03B3>
have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the 
role of ERR<U+03B3> in cardiac hypertrophy. The functional roles of ERR<U+03B3> in the
development of cardiac hypertrophy were examined in primary cultured
cardiomyocytes and in animal models. ERR<U+03B3> expression was increased in hearts from
human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and in both cellular and animal models
of cardiac hypertrophy. Transgenic overexpression in mouse heart as well as
forced expression of ERR<U+03B3> in cardiomyocytes induced hypertrophic phenotypes.
Knock-down of ERR<U+03B3> blocked agonist-induced hypertrophic phenotypes. ERR<U+03B3> bound
directly to the proximal ERR-responsive element in the GATA4 promoter in a
sequence-specific manner and thereby induced transcription. ERR<U+03B3>-induced
hypertrophy was blocked by inhibition of GATA4. GSK-5182, an inverse agonist of
ERR<U+03B3>, completely blocked cardiac hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes. It also prevented
aortic banding-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in mouse heart. These
findings demonstrate a novel ERR<U+03B3>/GATA4 signal cascade in the development of
cardiac hypertrophy and suggest GSK-5182 as a possible therapeutic.

A recent renaissance in small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) made this technique a
major tool for the low-resolution structural characterization of biological
macromolecules in solution. The major limitation of existing methods for
reconstructing 3D models from SAXS is imposed by the requirement of solute
monodispersity. We present a novel approach that couples low-resolution 3D SAXS
reconstruction with composition analysis of mixtures. The approach is applicable 
to polydisperse and difficult to purify systems, including weakly associated
oligomers and transient complexes. Ab initio shape analysis is possible for
symmetric homo-oligomers, whereas rigid body modeling is applied also to
dissociating complexes when atomic structures of the individual subunits are
available. In both approaches, the sample is considered as an equilibrium mixture
of intact complexes/oligomers with their dissociation products or free subunits. 
The algorithms provide the 3D low-resolution model (for ab initio modeling, also 
the shape of the monomer) and the volume fractions of the bound and free
state(s). The simultaneous fitting of multiple scattering data sets collected
under different conditions allows one to restrain the modeling further. The
possibilities of the approach are illustrated in simulated and experimental SAXS 
data from protein oligomers and multisubunit complexes including nucleoproteins. 
Using this approach, new structural insights are provided in the association
behavior and conformations of estrogen-related receptors ERRa and ERR<U+03B3>. The
possibility of 3D modeling from the scattering by mixtures significantly widens
the range of applicability of SAXS and opens novel avenues in the analysis of
oligomeric mixtures and assembly/dissociation processes.

Nuclear translocation of angiogenin (ANG) is essential for the proliferation of
its target cells. ANG promotes rRNA synthesis, while whether it regulates mRNA
transcription remains unknown. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation method, we
have identified 12 ANG-binding sequences. One of these sequences lies in the
estrogen receptor-related receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) gene which we designated as
ANG-Binding Sequence within ERR<U+03B3> (ABSE). ABSE exhibited ANG-dependent repressor
activity in the luciferase reporter system. Down-regulation of ANG increased ERR<U+03B3>
expression, and active gene marker level at the ABSE region. The expression
levels of ERR<U+03B3> targets genes, p21(WAF/CIP) and p27(KIP1), and the occupation of
ERR<U+03B3> on their promoter regions were increased in ANG-deficient cells accordingly.
Furthermore, knockdown of ERR<U+03B3> promoted the proliferation rate in ANG-deficient
breast cancer cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry staining showed negative
correlation between ANG and ERR<U+03B3> in breast cancer tissue. Altogether, our study
provides evidence that nuclear ANG directly binds to the ABSE of ERR<U+03B3> gene and
inhibits ERR<U+03B3> transcription to promote breast cancer cell proliferation.

The xenoestrogen bisphenol A (2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propane, BPA) is a
known endocrine-disrupting chemical used in the fabrication of plastics, resins
and flame retardants, that can be found throughout the environment and in
numerous every day products. Human exposure to this chemical is extensive and
generally occurs via oral route because it leaches from the food and beverage
containers that contain it. Although most of the effects related to BPA exposure 
have been linked to the activation of the estrogen receptor (ER), the mechanisms 
of the interaction of BPA with protein targets different from ER are still
unknown. Therefore, the objective of this work was to use a bioinformatics
approach to identify possible new targets for BPA. Docking studies were performed
between the optimized structure of BPA and 271 proteins related to different
biochemical processes, as selected by text-mining. Refinement docking experiments
and conformational analyses were carried out using LigandScout 3.0 for the
proteins selected through the affinity ranking (lower than -8.0kcal/mol). Several
proteins including ERR gamma (-9.9kcal/mol), and dual specificity protein kinases
CLK-4 (-9.5kcal/mol), CLK-1 (-9.1kcal/mol) and CLK-2 (-9.0kcal/mol) presented
great in silico binding affinities for BPA. The interactions between those
proteins and BPA were mostly hydrophobic with the presence of some hydrogen bonds
formed by leucine and asparagine residues. Therefore, this study suggests that
this endocrine disruptor may have other targets different from the ER.

involves a similar recognition mechanism.

BACKGROUND: PGC-1a is a crucial regulator of cellular metabolism and energy
homeostasis that functionally acts together with the estrogen-related receptors
(ERRa and ERR<U+03B3>) in the regulation of mitochondrial and metabolic gene networks.
Dimerization of the ERRs is a pre-requisite for interactions with PGC-1a and
other coactivators, eventually leading to transactivation. It was suggested
recently (Devarakonda et al) that PGC-1a binds in a strikingly different manner
to ERR<U+03B3> ligand-binding domains (LBDs) compared to its mode of binding to ERRa and
other nuclear receptors (NRs), where it interacts directly with the two ERR<U+03B3>
homodimer subunits.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we show that PGC-1a receptor interacting domain
(RID) binds in an almost identical manner to ERRa and ERR<U+03B3> homodimers. Microscale
thermophoresis demonstrated that the interactions between PGC-1a RID and ERR LBDs
involve a single receptor subunit through high-affinity, ERR-specific L3 and
low-affinity L2 interactions. NMR studies further defined the limits of PGC-1a
RID that interacts with ERRs. Consistent with these findings, the solution
structures of PGC-1a/ERRa LBDs and PGC-1a/ERR<U+03B3> LBDs complexes share an identical 
architecture with an asymmetric binding of PGC-1a to homodimeric ERR.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies provide the molecular determinants for
the specificity of interactions between PGC-1a and the ERRs, whereby negative
cooperativity prevails in the binding of the coactivators to these receptors. Our
work indicates that allosteric regulation may be a general mechanism controlling 
the binding of the coactivators to homodimers.

a and <U+03B3> activities.

Kaempferol is a dietary flavonoid that can function as a selective estrogen
receptor modulator (SERM). Estrogen-related receptors alpha and gamma (ERRa and
ERR<U+03B3>) are orphan nuclear receptors that play important roles in mitochondrial
biogenesis and cancer development. We have shown that kaempferol can functionally
antagonize the activities of ERRs based on both response element reporter systems
and target gene analysis. Kaempferol modulation of mitochondrial function and
suppression cancer cell growth has been confirmed. These findings suggest that
kaempferol may exert their anti-cancer activities through antagonizing ERRs
activities.

Treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by replacing mutant dystrophin or 
restoring dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAG) has been clinically
challenging. Instead, identifying and targeting muscle pathways deregulated in
DMD will provide new therapeutic avenues. We report that the expression of
nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor-<U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>), and its metabolic and
angiogenic targets are down-regulated (50-85%) in skeletal muscles of mdx mice
(DMD model) vs. wild-type mice. Corelatively, oxidative myofibers, muscle
vasculature, and exercise tolerance (33%) are decreased in mdx vs. wild-type
mice. Overexpressing ERR<U+03B3> selectively in the dystrophic muscles of the mdx mice
restored metabolic and angiogenic gene expression compared with control mdx mice.
Further, ERR<U+03B3> enhanced muscle oxidative myofibers, vasculature, and blood flow
(by 33-66%) and improved exercise tolerance (by 75%) in the dystrophic mice.
Restoring muscle ERR<U+03B3> pathway ameliorated muscle damage and also prevented DMD
hallmarks of postexercise muscle damage, hypoxia, and fatigue in mdx mice.
Notably, ERR<U+03B3> did not restore sarcolemmal DAG complex, which is thus dispensable 
for antidystrophic effects of ERR<U+03B3>. In summary, ERR<U+03B3>-dependent metabolic and
angiogenic gene program is defective in DMD, and we demonstrate that its
restoration is a potential strategy for treating muscular dystrophy.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disorder with diverse 
pathological manifestations and is often associated with abnormal regulation of
hepatic glucose production. Many nuclear receptors known to control the hepatic
gluconeogenic program are potential targets for the treatment of T2DM and its
complications. Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of the estrogen-related
receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) in T2DM remains unknown. In this study, we show that the
nuclear receptor ERR<U+03B3> is a major contributor to hyperglycemia under diabetic
conditions by controlling hepatic glucose production. Hepatic ERR<U+03B3> expression
induced by fasting and diabetic conditions resulted in elevated levels of
gluconeogenic gene expression and blood glucose in wild-type mice. Conversely,
ablation of hepatic ERR<U+03B3> gene expression reduced the expression of gluconeogenic 
genes and normalized blood glucose levels in mouse models of T2DM: db/db and
diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. In addition, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
study and long-term studies of the antidiabetic effects of GSK5182, the
ERR<U+03B3>-specific inverse agonist, in db/db and DIO mice demonstrated that GSK5182
normalizes hyperglycemia mainly through inhibition of hepatic glucose production.
Our findings suggest that the ability of GSK5182 to control hepatic glucose
production can be used as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of T2DM.

Orphan nuclear receptor ERR<U+03B3> is a member of nuclear receptor superfamily that
regulates several important cellular processes including hepatic glucose and
alcohol metabolism. However, mechanistic understanding of transcriptional
regulation of the ERR<U+03B3> gene remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that
activating transcription factor 6a (ATF6a), an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-membrane-bound basic leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor, directly
regulates ERR<U+03B3> gene expression in response to ER stress. ATF6a binds to ATF6a
responsive element in the ERR<U+03B3> promoter. The transcriptional coactivator
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-a (PGC-1a) is
required for this transactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
confirmed the binding of both ATF6a and PGC1a on the ERR<U+03B3> promoter. ChIP assay
demonstrated histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurs at the ATF6a and PGC1a binding 
site. Of interest, ERR<U+03B3> along with PGC1a induce ATF6a gene transcription upon ER 
stress. ERR<U+03B3> binds to an ERR<U+03B3> responsive element in the ATF6a promoter. ChIP
assay confirmed that both ERR<U+03B3> and PGC1a bind to a site in the ATF6a promoter
that exhibits histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Overall, for the first time our data
show a novel pathway of cross talk between nuclear receptors and
ER-membrane-bound transcription factors and suggest a positive feed-forward loop 
regulates ERR<U+03B3> and ATF6a gene transcription.

The mechanisms involved in the coordinate regulation of the metabolic and
structural programs controlling muscle fitness and endurance are unknown.
Recently, the nuclear receptor PPARß/d was shown to activate muscle endurance
programs in transgenic mice. In contrast, muscle-specific transgenic
overexpression of the related nuclear receptor, PPARa, results in reduced
capacity for endurance exercise. We took advantage of the divergent actions of
PPARß/d and PPARa to explore the downstream regulatory circuitry that
orchestrates the programs linking muscle fiber type with energy metabolism. Our
results indicate that, in addition to the well-established role in
transcriptional control of muscle metabolic genes, PPARß/d and PPARa participate 
in programs that exert opposing actions upon the type I fiber program through a
distinct muscle microRNA (miRNA) network, dependent on the actions of another
nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>). Gain-of-function and
loss-of-function strategies in mice, together with assessment of muscle biopsies 
from humans, demonstrated that type I muscle fiber proportion is increased via
the stimulatory actions of ERR<U+03B3> on the expression of miR-499 and miR-208b. This
nuclear receptor/miRNA regulatory circuit shows promise for the identification of
therapeutic targets aimed at maintaining muscle fitness in a variety of chronic
disease states, such as obesity, skeletal myopathies, and heart failure.

Divergent regulation of the Osteopontin promoter by the estrogen receptor-related
receptors is isoform- and cell context dependent.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada.

We sought to determine whether the estrogen receptor-related receptor gamma
(mEsrrg) regulated the Osteopontin (Opn) promoter through the same AP1/CAAT box
element that we have previously described for mEsrra. In HeLa cells mEsrrg used
an additional site present in the 5'UTR, while in ROS17/2.8 cells the AP1/CAAT
site was not used, but a completely novel site surrounding the transcription
start site was used. We also find that in ROS17/2.8 cells mEsrra repressed, while
mEsrrg activated the Opn promoter. None of the sites identified conform to
established Esrr response elements (ERREs). Additionally, the two reported mEsrrg
protein isoforms showed differences in their activation potential. Mutations in
the activation function 2 (AF2) of mEsrra, predicted to abolish activation,
surprisingly turned mEsrra into a better activator. In contrast, similar AF2
mutations in Esrrg2 abolished its ability to activate the Opn promoter. Mutation 
of the DNA binding domain of mEsrra/g2 abolished transcriptional activity in HeLa
and ROS17/2.8 cells. Our data indicate, first, that the two Esrr isoforms
regulate Opn in a cell context-dependent manner. Second, they suggest that
although the DNA binding domains of mEsrra and mEsrrg are 93% identical and
required for regulation, the receptors bind to distinct Opn promoter elements,
suggesting that the two isoforms may co-regulate Opn, and perhaps other genes,
without competing for the same site in the promoter. Finally, the results suggest
that each isoform interacts differently with co-activators and co-repressors, as 
highlighted by the AF2 mutation that turns mEsrra into a better activator but
abolishes activity of Esrrg2.

miR-205 promotes tumor proliferation and invasion through targeting ESRRG in
endometrial carcinoma.

Tong University, Shanghai 200030, PR China.

Increasing evidence suggests that miR-205 is frequently dysregulated in many
types of human cancers, suggesting its important roles in the initiation and
progression of cancer. However, the functions of miR-205 in human endometrial
endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) are still unknown. In this study, we investigated
the expression of miR-205 in both normal endometrium and EEC tissues using
TaqMan PCR. Compared to normal tissues, miR-205 was significantly upregulated in 
EEC (P<0.001). After transfection of miR-205 inhibitors into Ishikawa cells (or
transfection of miR-205 mimics into AN3CA cells), we demonstrated that the
cellular proliferation, migration and invasion properties were negatively
regulated by miR-205. Moreover, by combination of microRNA target prediction
algorithms and luciferase reporter system, we identified estrogen-related
receptor-<U+03B3> (ESRRG) as a target of miR-205. In conclusion, we demonstrated
frequent upregulation of miR-205 in EEC. In gain-of-function and loss-of-function
assays, inhibition of miR-205 reduced cellular proliferation, migration and
invasion; vice versa, increased levels of miR-205 led to upregulated cellular
proliferation, migration and invasion. Nonetheless, we identified the ESRRG gene 
to be a novel target, which could be helpful to elucidate mechanisms underlying
the tumorigenesis of EEC.

Estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) serves a critical O2-dependent regulatory role
in the differentiation of human cytotrophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblast. In this 
study, we investigated expression of genes encoding tissue kallikrein (KLK1) and 
voltage-gated K(+) channels (KV7) during differentiation of human trophoblasts in
culture and the roles of ERR<U+03B3> and O2 tension in their regulation. Expression of
KLK1 and the KV7 channel subunits, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE3, and KCNE5, increased
during differentiation of cultured human trophoblast cells in a 20% O2
environment. Notably, together with ERR<U+03B3>, expression of KLK1, KCNQ1, KCNE1,
KCNE3, and KCNE5 was markedly reduced when cells were cultured in a hypoxic
environment (2% O2). Moreover, upon transduction of trophoblast cells with short 
hairpin RNAs for endogenous ERR<U+03B3>, KLK1, KCNQ1, KCNE1, and KCNE3 expression was
significantly decreased. Promoter and site-directed mutagenesis studies in
transfected cells identified putative ERR<U+03B3> response elements within the KLK1 and 
KCNE1 5'-flanking regions required for ERR<U+03B3>-stimulated transcriptional activity. 
Binding of endogenous ERR<U+03B3> to these ERR<U+03B3> response elements increased during
trophoblast differentiation in culture and was inhibited by hypoxia. The KV7
blocker linopirdine reduced human chorionic gonadotropin secretion and
aggregation of cultured human trophoblasts, suggesting a possible role of KV7
channels in cell fusion and differentiation. Illumina gene expression arrays of
cultured human trophoblast cells revealed several genes upregulated during
syncytiotrophoblast differentiation and downregulated upon ERR<U+03B3> knockdown
involved in cell differentiation, adhesion, and synthesis of steroid and peptide 
hormones required for placental development and function. Collectively, these
findings suggest that ERR<U+03B3> mediates O2-dependent expression of genes involved in 
human trophoblast differentiation, function, and vascular homeostasis.

Since estrogen is thought to protect pre-menopausal women from age-related
hearing loss, we investigated whether variation in estrogen-signalling genes is
linked to hearing status in the 1958 British Birth Cohort. This analysis
implicated the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG) gene in determining adult 
hearing function and was investigated further in a total of 6134 individuals in 3
independent cohorts: (i) the 1958 British Birth Cohort; (ii) a London ARHL
case-control cohort; and (iii) a cohort from isolated populations of Italy and
Silk Road countries. Evidence of an association between the minor allele of
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2818964 and hearing status was found in
females, but not in males in 2 of these cohorts: p = 0.0058 (London ARHL) and p =
0.0065 (Carlantino, Italy). Furthermore, assessment of hearing in Esrrg knock-out
mice revealed a mild 25-dB hearing loss at 5 weeks of age. At 12 weeks, average
hearing thresholds in female mice((-/-)) were 15 dB worse than in males((-/-)).
Together these data indicate ESRRG plays a role in maintenance of hearing in both
humans and mice.

Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) a, ß and <U+03B3> are orphan nuclear hormone receptors
with no known ligands. Little is known concerning the role of ERRß in energy
homeostasis, as complete ERRß-null mice die mid-gestation. We generated two
viable conditional ERRß-null mouse models to address its metabolic function.
Whole-body deletion of ERRß in Sox2-Cre:ERRß(lox/lox) mice resulted in major
alterations in body composition, metabolic rate, meal patterns and voluntary
physical activity levels. Nestin-Cre:ERRß(lox/lox) mice exhibited decreased
expression of ERRß in hindbrain neurons, the predominant site of expression,
decreased neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene expression in the hindbrain, increased lean
body mass, insulin sensitivity, increased energy expenditure, decreased satiety
and decreased time between meals. In the absence of ERRß, increased ERR<U+03B3>
signaling decreased satiety and the duration of time between meals, similar to
meal patterns observed for both the Sox2-Cre:ERRß(lox/lox) and
Nestin-Cre:ERRß(lox/lox) strains of mice. Central and/or peripheral ERR<U+03B3>
signaling may modulate these phenotypes by decreasing NPY gene expression.
Overall, the relative expression ratio between ERRß and ERR<U+03B3> may be important in 
modulating ingestive behavior, specifically satiety, gene expression, as well as 
whole-body energy balance.

to Runx2 mRNA in C3H10T1/2 cells.

AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are involved in various biological processes including
cellular differentiation. However, the role of miR-433 in osteoblast
differentiation remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to
investigate the effect of miR-433 on BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation.
MAIN METHODS: The expression of mature miR-433 in cells was detected by real-time
PCR. RT-PCR or real-time PCR was used to confirm the expression of osteogenic
genes. For the activation or inhibition of miR-433 expression, we used a
precursor form of miR-433 or anti-miR-433. Functional activity of miR-433 and
Runx2 was evaluated by promoter study. Osteoblast differentiation was evaluated
by analyzing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity.
KEY FINDING: ERR<U+03B3> increased miR-433 expression in the mesenchymal stem cell
lineage C3H10T1/2. During the BMP2-induction of osteoblastic differentiation of
C3H10T1/2, ERR<U+03B3> and miR433 expression decreased. In addition, during the
osteoblastic differentiation, overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> or miR-433 inhibited the
expression of osteogenic marker genes such as Runx2 and ALP. A computer-based
prediction algorithm led to the identification of three miR-433 binding sites [S1
(114-145 bp), S2 (3735-3766 bp) and S3 (3828-3860 bp)] on the 3'-UTR of Runx2
mRNA. Furthermore, miR-433 directly targeted S1 and S2, and decreased the level
of Runx2 transcript. In addition, miR-433 inhibited BMP2-induced 6×OSE-Luc
activities. Anti-miR-433 recovered ERR<U+03B3>-suppressed Runx2 expression and ALP
activity.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrated that miR-433 suppressed BMP2-indcued
osteoblast differentiation by decreasing the level of Runx2 transcript.

The physiological functions of a tissue in the body are carried out by its
complement of expressed genes. Genes that execute a particular function should be
more specifically expressed in tissues that perform the function. Given this
premise, we mined public microarray expression data to build a database of genes 
ranked by their specificity of expression in multiple organs. The database
permitted the accurate identification of genes and functions known to be specific
to individual organs. Next, we used the database to predict transcriptional
regulators of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and validated two candidate genes. Based
upon hypotheses regarding pathways shared between combinations of BAT or white
adipose tissue (WAT) and other organs, we identified genes that met threshold
criteria for specific or counterspecific expression in each tissue. By
contrasting WAT to the heart and BAT, the two most mitochondria-rich tissues in
the body, we discovered a novel function for the transcription factor ESRRG in
the induction of BAT genes in white adipocytes. Because the heart and other
estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG)-rich tissues do not express BAT markers, 
we hypothesized that an adipocyte co-regulator acts with ESRRG. By comparing WAT 
and BAT to the heart, brain, kidney and skeletal muscle, we discovered that an
isoform of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding
transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) induces BAT markers in C2C12 myocytes in the
presence of ESRRG. The results demonstrate a straightforward bioinformatic
strategy to associate genes with functions. The database upon which the strategy 
is based is provided so that investigators can perform their own screens.

OBJECTIVE: Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are orphan nuclear receptors that
modulate the estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated pathway and play roles in the
regulation of breast and prostate cancer cell growth. However, the significance
of the localization and the function of ERRs in uterine endometrial cancer remain
unclear. We aimed to measure the expression of ERR<U+03B3> and determine its association
with the ER-mediated pathway in human endometrial cancer.
METHODS: Proliferation, luciferase, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction
assays were performed in ERa-positive (Ishikawa) and ERa-negative (HEC1A)
endometrial cancer cell lines. The association between ERR<U+03B3> and ERa expressions
was determined by immunohistochemical analysis in uterine endometrial cancer
tissues.
RESULTS: Estrogen-induced estrogen response element transcriptional activity was 
repressed by ERR<U+03B3> in ERa-positive cells but was stimulated by ERR<U+03B3> in
ERa-negative cells. The stable overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> regulated the in vitro cell
growth in the ERa-positive and ERa-negative endometrial cancer cell lines. A
selective ERR<U+03B3> agonist, DY131, inhibited the growth of the ERa-positive
endometrial cancer cells but promoted that of the ERa-negative cancer cells.
Furthermore, we found that ERR<U+03B3> is expressed in the nuclei of human uterine
endometrial cancer tissues. Estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> was not associated with
pathological parameters such as the International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics stage and histological type. The uterine endometrial cancer tissues
with ERR<U+03B3>-positive/ERa-negative status may have a significantly poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between ERR<U+03B3> and ERa status could be a predictive
marker for the treatment of uterine endometrial cancer, which provides an impetus
for the identification of ligands for nuclear orphan receptor ERR<U+03B3>.

receptor ERR<U+03B3>.

Multiple cellular signaling pathways that control metabolism and survival are
activated when cell are incubated under hypoxic conditions. Activation of the
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 promotes expression of genes that increase the
capacity to cope with the stress imposed by a reduced oxygen environment. Here we
show that the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) plays a 
critical role in hypoxia-mediated activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4
(PDK4) gene expression. ERR<U+03B3> mRNA and protein levels were increased by hypoxia or
desferrioxamine (DFO) treatment in hepatoma cell lines. Co-expression of HIF-1a
and ß increased ERR<U+03B3> promoter activity as well as mRNA expression, while
knockdown of endogenous HIF-1a reduced the hypoxia-mediated induction of ERR<U+03B3>. In
addition, hypoxia also increased the promoter activity and mRNA level of PDK4 in 
HepG2 cells. Adenovirus mediated-overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> specifically increased
PDK4 gene expression, while ablation of endogenous ERR<U+03B3> significantly decreased
hypoxia-mediated induction of PDK4 gene expression. Finally, GSK5182, an inverse 
agonist of ERR<U+03B3>, strongly inhibited the hypoxia-mediated induction of PDK4
protein and promoter activity. Regulation of the transcriptional activity of ERR<U+03B3>
may provide a therapeutic approach for the regulation of PDK4 gene expression
under hypoxia.

Impaired myogenesis in estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>)-deficient skeletal
myocytes due to oxidative stress.

Specialized contractile function and increased mitochondrial number and oxidative
capacity are hallmark features of myocyte differentiation. The estrogen-related
receptors (ERRs) can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis or mitochondrial enzyme
expression in skeletal muscle, suggesting that ERRs may have a role in promoting 
myogenesis. Therefore, we characterized myogenic programs in primary myocytes
isolated from wild-type (M-ERR<U+03B3>WT) and muscle-specific ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) (M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-))
mice. Myotube maturation and number were decreased throughout differentiation in 
M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) primary myocytes, resulting in myotubes with reduced mitochondrial
content and sarcomere assembly. Compared with M-ERR<U+03B3>WT myocytes at the same
differentiation stage, the glucose oxidation rate was reduced by 30% in
M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) myotubes, while medium-chain fatty acid oxidation was increased by
34% in M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) myoblasts and 36% in M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) myotubes. Concomitant with
increased reliance on mitochondrial ß-oxidation, H(2)O(2) production was
significantly increased by 40% in M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) myoblasts and 70% in M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-)
myotubes compared to M-ERR<U+03B3>WT myocytes. ROS activation of FoxO and NF-<U+03BA>B and
their downstream targets, atrogin-1 and MuRF1, was observed in M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-)
myocytes. The antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine rescued myotube formation and atrophy
gene induction in M-ERR<U+03B3>(-/-) myocytes. These results suggest that loss of ERR<U+03B3>
causes metabolic defects and oxidative stress that impair myotube formation
through activation of skeletal muscle atrophy pathways.

BACKGROUND: The hepatic endocannabinoid system and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), 
a key enzyme causing alcohol-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
are major contributors to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. The
nuclear hormone receptor oestrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is a constitutively 
active transcriptional activator regulating gene expression.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of ERR<U+03B3> in the alcohol-mediated regulation of 
CYP2E1 and to examine the possibility to control alcohol-mediated oxidative
stress and liver injury through an ERR<U+03B3> inverse agonist.
DESIGN: For chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis study, C57BL/6J wild-type and
CB1(-/-) mice were administered alcohol for 4 weeks. GSK5182 and chlormethiazole 
(CMZ) were given by oral gavage for the last 2 weeks of alcohol feeding. Gene
expression profiles and biochemical assays were performed using the liver or
blood of mice.
RESULTS: Hepatic ERR<U+03B3> gene expression induced by alcohol-mediated activation of
CB1 receptor results in induction of CYP2E1, while liver-specific ablation of
ERR<U+03B3> gene expression blocks alcohol-induced expression of CYP2E1 in mouse liver. 
An ERR<U+03B3> inverse agonist significantly ameliorates chronic alcohol-induced liver
injury in mice through inhibition of CYP2E1-mediated generation of ROS, while
inhibition of CYP2E1 by CMZ abrogates the beneficial effects of the inverse
agonist. Finally, chronic alcohol-mediated ERR<U+03B3> and CYP2E1 gene expression, ROS
generation and liver injury in normal mice were nearly abolished in CB1(-/-)
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: ERR<U+03B3>, as a previously unrecognised transcriptional regulator of
hepatic CB1 receptor, controls alcohol-induced oxidative stress and liver injury 
through CYP2E1 induction, and its inverse agonist could ameliorate oxidative
liver injury due to chronic alcohol exposure.

Molecular docking of bisphenol A and its nitrated and chlorinated metabolites
onto human estrogen-related receptor-gamma.

A xenoestrogen and known endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A (BPA) binds the human
estrogen-related receptor-gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) with high affinity (Kd  5.5 nM). It is
likely that BPA undergoes oxidative biotransformation by
hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid ((-)OCl/HOCl) and peroxynitrite (PN) and the
products formed in these reactions may serve as secondary estrogens and
contribute to the toxicodynamics of BPA. Therefore, in the present study we have 
examined the formation of chlorinated and nitrated BPA in reactions of BPA with
(-)OCl/HOCl and PN(+CO(2)) performed around the neutral pH. We have identified
four major products in these reactions and they include 3-chloro-BPA (CBPA),
3,3'-dichloro-BPA (DCBPA), 3-nitro-BPA (NBPA) and 3,3'-dinitro-BPA (DNBPA).
Towards understanding the toxicodynamics and estrogenic activity of BPA in
biological systems, we have performed molecular docking of BPA, CBPA, DCBPA,
DNBPA and NBPA onto the ERR<U+03B3> using AutoDock 4.2 software and compared the binding
energies with those of estradiol, the natural ligand. Based on the genetic
algorithm, the three best conformations were selected and averaged for each
ligand and a detailed analysis of molecular interactions based on free energies
of binding (kcal/mol) was computed. The results indicate the following rank order
of binding to ERR<U+03B3>: BPA (-8.78 ± 0.06) > CBPA (-8.53 ± 0.41) > NBPA (-7.36 ±
0.74) > DCBPA (-5.24 ± 0.17) > DNBPA (-4.95 ± 0.78) > estradiol (-4.94 ± 1.04).
The docking studies revealed that the OH group of one of the phenyl rings forms a
hydrogen bond with Glu275/Arg316, while the OH group of other phenyl ring was
bound to Asp346. These results suggest that both BPA and its putative chlorinated
and nitrated metabolites have strong binding affinity compared to estradiol.

Distinct mechanisms of endocrine disruption of DDT-related pesticides toward
estrogen receptor a and estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3>.

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is ubiquitous in the environment, and the
exposure to DDT and its related pesticides has long been linked to endocrine
disruption. The mechanism of endocrine disruption toward targeted receptors,
however, remains unclear. Probing the molecular recognition of DDT analogs by
targeted receptors at the atomic level is critical for deciphering this
mechanism. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to probe the
molecular recognition process of DDT and its five analogs, including
dichlordiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD),
methoxychlor (MXC), p,p'-hydroxy-DDT (HPTE), and dicofol by human estrogen
receptor (ER) a and human ER-related receptor (ERR) <U+03B3>. Van der Waals interactions
mainly drive the interactions of DDT analogs with ERa ligand-binding domain (LBD)
and ERR<U+03B3> LBD. Minor structural changes of DDT analogs in the number and position 
of chlorine and phenolic hydroxyl moiety cause differences in binding modes
through aromatic stacking and hydrogen bonding and thus affect differently
conformational changes of ERa LBD and ERR<U+03B3> LBD. The binding of DDT analogs
affects the helix 12 orientation of ERa LBD but causes no rearrangement of helix 
12 of ERR<U+03B3> LBD. These results extend our understanding of how DDT analogs exert
their estrogen-disrupting effects toward different receptors via multiple
mechanisms.

Placenta growth and functions depend on correct trophoblast migration,
proliferation, and differentiation. The placenta has a critical role in gas and
nutrient transport. To accomplish these numerous functions, the placenta depends 
on a highly efficient energy metabolism control. Recent studies showed that the
orphan nuclear receptor Estrogen-Related Receptor gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) is highly
expressed in human placentas. As ERR<U+03B3> has been described as a major energy
metabolism regulator, we investigated ERR<U+03B3> expression and putative roles on
energy homeostasis in human trophoblast from first trimester placentas. First, we
showed that ERR<U+03B3> expression level increased during pregnancy and that ERR<U+03B3> was
more abundant in villous than in extravillous trophoblasts. We also observed that
ERR<U+03B3> expression increased during trophoblast differentiation. Second, we
demonstrated that mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of some energy
metabolism target genes decreased when ERR<U+03B3> expression was impaired. Altogether, 
these results suggest that ERR<U+03B3> could be implicated in the energy metabolism
regulation of human trophoblasts.

Murine lupus susceptibility locus Sle1c2 mediates CD4+ T cell activation and maps
to estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3>.

Sle1c is a sublocus of the NZM2410-derived Sle1 major lupus susceptibility locus.
We have shown previously that Sle1c contributes to lupus pathogenesis by
conferring increased CD4(+) T cell activation and increased susceptibility to
chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which mapped to the centromeric
portion of the locus. In this study, we have refined the centromeric sublocus to 
a 675-kb interval, termed Sle1c2. Mice from recombinant congenic strains
expressing Sle1c2 exhibited increased CD4(+) T cell intrinsic activation and
cGVHD susceptibility, similar to mice with the parental Sle1c. In addition,
B6.Sle1c2 mice displayed a robust expansion of IFN-<U+03B3>-expressing T cells. NZB
complementation studies showed that Sle1c2 expression exacerbated B cell
activation, autoantibody production, and renal pathology, verifying that Sle1c2
contributes to lupus pathogenesis. The Sle1c2 interval contains two genes, only
one of which, Esrrg, is expressed in T cells. B6.Sle1c2 CD4(+) T cells expressed 
less Esrrg than B6 CD4(+) T cells, and Esrrg expression was correlated negatively
with CD4(+) T cell activation. Esrrg encodes an orphan nuclear receptor that
regulates oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial functions. In accordance with
reduced Esrrg expression, B6.Sle1c2 CD4(+) T cells present reduced mitochondrial 
mass and altered mitochondrial functions as well as altered metabolic pathway
utilization when compared with B6 CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, we propose
Esrrg as a novel lupus susceptibility gene regulating CD4(+) T cell function
through their mitochondrial metabolism.

Glucose homeostasis is tightly controlled by hormonal regulation of hepatic
glucose production. Dysregulation of this system is often associated with insulin
resistance and diabetes, resulting in hyperglycemia in mammals. Here, we show
that the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is a novel
downstream mediator of glucagon action in hepatic gluconeogenesis and demonstrate
a beneficial impact of the inverse agonist GSK5182. Hepatic ERR<U+03B3> expression was
increased by fasting-dependent activation of the cAMP-response element-binding
protein-CRTC2 pathway. Overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> induced Pck1 and G6PC gene
expression and glucose production in primary hepatocytes, whereas abolition of
ERR<U+03B3> gene expression attenuated forskolin-mediated induction of gluconeogenic
gene expression. Deletion and mutation analyses of the Pck1 promoter showed that 
ERR<U+03B3> directly regulates the Pck1 gene transcription via ERR response elements of 
the Pck1 promoter as confirmed by ChIP assay and in vivo imaging analysis. We
also demonstrate that GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERR<U+03B3>, specifically inhibits 
the transcriptional activity of ERR<U+03B3> in a PGC-1a dependent manner. Finally, the
ERR<U+03B3> inverse agonist ameliorated hyperglycemia through inhibition of hepatic
gluconeogenesis in db/db mice. Control of hepatic glucose production by an
ERR<U+03B3>-specific inverse agonist is a new potential therapeutic approach for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms implicated in regionalized gene expression
in the human epididymis have not yet been fully elucidated. Interestingly, more
than 200 microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the human epididymis and
could be involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and post-transcriptional
expression in this organ.
METHODS: Using a miRNA microarray approach, we investigated the correlation
between miRNA signatures and gene expression profiles found in three distinct
regions (caput, corpus and cauda) of human epididymides from 3 donors. In silico 
prediction of transcript miRNA targets was performed using TargetScan and Miranda
software's. FHCE1 immortalized epididymal cell lines were cotransfected with
mimic microRNAs and plasmid constructs containing the 3'UTR of predicted target
genes downstream of the luciferase gene.
RESULTS: We identified 35 miRNAs differentially expressed in the distinct
segments of the epididymis (fold change =2, P-value = 0.01). Among these miRNAs, 
miR-890, miR-892a, miR-892b, miR-891a, miR-891b belonging to the same
epididymis-enriched cluster located on the X chromosome, are significantly more
expressed in the corpus and cauda regions than in the caput. Interestingly, a
strong negative correlation (r = -0,89, P-value = 0.001) was found between the
pattern of expression of miR-892b and its potential mRNA target Esrrg (Estrogen
Related Receptor Gamma) and with miR-145 and Cldn10 mRNA (r = -0,92, P-value =
0.001). We confirmed that miR-145 and miR-892b inhibit the expression of the
luciferase reporter via Cldn10 and Esrrg 3' UTRs, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the expression of miRNAs is segmented along the 
human epididymis and correlates with the pattern of target gene expression in
different regions. Therefore, epididymal miRNAs may be in control of the
maintenance of gene expression profile in the epididymis, which dictates
segment-specific secretion of proteins and establishes physiological compartments
that directly or indirectly affect sperm maturation and fertility.

Glucose oxidation modulates anoikis and tumor metastasis.

Cancer cells exhibit altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for
aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect, and the cells resist matrix
detachment-induced apoptosis, which is called anoikis, a barrier to metastasis.
It remains largely unclear whether tumor metabolism influences anoikis and
metastasis. Here we show that when detached from the matrix, untransformed
mammary epithelial cells undergo metabolic reprogramming by markedly upregulating
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) through estrogen-related receptor
gamma (ERR<U+03B3>), thereby inhibiting PDH and attenuating the flux of glycolytic
carbon into mitochondrial oxidation. To decipher the significance of this
metabolic response, we found that depletion of PDK4 or activation of PDH
increased mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress in suspended cells,
resulting in heightened anoikis. Conversely, overexpression of PDKs prolonged
survival of cells in suspension. Therefore, decreased glucose oxidation following
cell detachment confers anoikis resistance. Unlike untransformed cells, most
cancer cells demonstrate reduced glucose oxidation even under attached
conditions, and thus they inherently possess a survival advantage when suspended.
Normalization of glucose metabolism by stimulating PDH in cancer cells restores
their susceptibility to anoikis and impairs their metastatic potential. These
results suggest that the Warburg effect, more specifically, diminished glucose
oxidation, promotes anoikis resistance and metastasis and that PDKs are potential
targets for antimetastasis therapy.

Motor neurons (MNs) are designated as alpha/gamma and fast/slow based on their
target sites and the types of muscle fibers innervated; however, few molecular
markers that distinguish between these subtypes are available. Here we report
that osteopontin (OPN) is a selective marker of alpha MNs in the mouse spinal
cord. OPN was detected in approximately 70% of postnatal choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive MNs with relatively large somas, but not in
those with smaller somas. OPN+/ChAT+ MNs were also positive for NeuN, an alpha MN
marker, but were negative for Err3, a gamma MN marker. The size distribution of
OPN+/ChAT+ cells was nearly identical to that of NeuN+/ChAT+ alpha MNs. Group Ia 
proprioceptive terminals immunoreactive for vesicular glutamate transporter-1
were selectively detected on the OPN+/ChAT+ cells. OPN staining was also detected
at motor axon terminals at neuromuscular junctions, where the OPN+ terminals were
positive or negative for SV2A, a marker distinguishing fast/slow motor endplates.
Finally, retrograde labeling following intramuscular injection of fast blue
indicated that OPN is expressed in both fast and slow MNs. Collectively, our
findings show that OPN is an alpha MN marker present in both the soma and the
endplates of alpha MNs in the postnatal mouse spinal cord.

RATIONALE: Oxidative myofibers in the skeletal muscles express high levels of
angiogenic factors, have dense vasculature, and promptly revascularize during
ischemia. Estrogen-related receptor-gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) activates genes that govern
metabolic and vascular features typical to oxidative myofibers. Therefore,
ERR<U+03B3>-dependent remodeling of the myofibers may promote neoangiogenesis and
restoration of blood perfusion in skeletal muscle ischemia.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the muscle fiber type remodeling by ERR<U+03B3> and its role
in the vascular recovery of ischemic muscle.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using immunohistology, we show that skeletal muscle-specific
transgenic overexpression of ERR<U+03B3> increases the proportions of oxidative and
densely vascularized type IIA and IIX myofibers and decreases glycolytic and less
vascularized type IIB myofibers. This myofiber remodeling results in a higher
basal blood flow in the transgenic skeletal muscle. By applying unilateral hind
limb ischemia to transgenic and wild-type mice, we found accelerated
revascularization (fluorescent microangiography), restoration of blood perfusion 
(laser Doppler flowmetry), and muscle repair (Evans blue dye exclusion) in
transgenic compared to wild-type ischemic muscles. This ameliorative effect is
linked to enhanced neoangiogenesis (CD31 staining and microfil perfusion) by
ERR<U+03B3>. Using cultured muscle cells in which ERR<U+03B3> is inactivated, we show that the 
receptor is dispensable for the classical hypoxic response of transcriptional
upregulation and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A. Rather, the
ameliorative effect of ERR<U+03B3> is linked to the receptor-mediated increase in
oxidative myofibers that inherently express and secrete high levels of angiogenic
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The ERR<U+03B3> is a hypoxia-independent inducer of neoangiogenesis that
can promote reparative revascularization.

Various lines of evidence have shown that bisphenol A (BPA) acts as an endocrine 
disruptor that affects various hormones even at merely physiological levels. We
demonstrated recently that BPA binds strongly to human nuclear receptor
estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>), one of 48 nuclear receptors. Based on X-ray
crystal analysis of the ERR<U+03B3> ligand-binding domain (LBD)/BPA complex, we
demonstrated that ERR<U+03B3> receptor residues, Glu275 and Arg316, function as the
intrinsic-binding site of the phenol-hydroxyl group of BPA. If these
phenol-hydroxyl<U+2194>Glu275 and Arg316 hydrogen bonds anchor the A-benzene ring of
BPA, the benzene-phenyl group of BPA would be in a pocket constructed by specific
amino acid side chain structures. In the present study, by evaluating the
Ala-replaced mutant receptors, we identified such a ligand-binding pocket.
Leu268, Leu271, Leu309 and Tyr326, in addition to the previously reported
participants Glu275 and Arg316, were found to make a receptacle pocket for the
A-ring, whereas Ile279, Ile310 and Val313 were found to assist or structurally
support these residues. The results revealed that each amino acid residue is an
essential structural element for the strong binding of BPA to ERR<U+03B3>.

neurons.

We demonstrated the rapid effects of 10nM bisphenol A (BPA) on the spinogenesis
of adult rat hippocampal slices. The density of spines was analyzed by imaging
Lucifer Yellow-injected CA1 neurons in slices. Not only the total spine density
but also the head diameter distribution of spine was quantitatively analyzed.
Spinogenesis was significantly enhanced by BPA within 2h. In particular, the
density of middle-head spine (with head diameter of 0.4-0.5µm) was significantly 
increased. Hydroxytamoxifen, an antagonist of both estrogen-related receptor
gamma (ERR<U+03B3>) and estrogen receptors (ERa/ERß), blocked the BPA-induced
enhancement of the spine density. However, ICI 182,780, an antagonist of ERa/ERß,
did not suppress the BPA effects. Therefore, ERR<U+03B3> is deduced to be a high
affinity receptor of BPA, responsible for modulation of spinogenesis. The
BPA-induced enhancement of spinogenesis was also suppressed by MAP kinase
inhibitor, PD98059, and the blocker of NMDA receptors, MK-801. Washout of BPA for
additional 2h after 2h BPA treatment abolished the BPA-induced enhancement of
spinogenesis, suggesting that the BPA effect was reversible. ERR<U+03B3> was localized
at synapses as well as cell bodies of principal neurons. ERR<U+03B3> at synapses may
contribute to the observed rapid effect. The level of BPA in the hippocampal
slices was determined by mass-spectrometric analysis.

Disorder-to-order transition underlies the structural basis for the assembly of a

Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) <U+03B3> coactivator-1a (PGC-1a) is a 
potent transcriptional coactivator of oxidative metabolism and is induced in
response to a variety of environmental cues. It regulates a broad array of target
genes by coactivating a whole host of transcription factors. The estrogen-related
receptor (ERR) family of nuclear receptors are key PGC-1a partners in the
regulation of mitochondrial and tissue-specific oxidative metabolic pathways;
these receptors also demonstrate strong physical and functional interactions with
this coactivator. Here we perform comprehensive biochemical, biophysical, and
structural analyses of the complex formed between PGC-1a and ERR<U+03B3>. PGC-1a
activation domain (PGC-1a(2-220)) is intrinsically disordered with limited
secondary and no defined tertiary structure. Complex formation with ERR<U+03B3> induces 
significant changes in the conformational mobility of both partners, highlighted 
by significant stabilization of the ligand binding domain (ERR<U+03B3>LBD) as determined
by HDX (hydrogen/deuterium exchange) and an observed disorder-to-order transition
in PGC-1a(2-220). Small-angle X-ray scattering studies allow for modeling of the 
solution structure of the activation domain in the absence and presence of
ERR<U+03B3>LBD, revealing a stable and compact binary complex. These data show that
PGC-1a(2-220) undergoes a large-scale conformational change when binding to the
ERR<U+03B3>LBD, leading to substantial compaction of the activation domain. This change 
results in stable positioning of the N-terminal part of the activation domain of 
PGC-1a, favorable for assembly of an active transcriptional complex. These data
also provide structural insight into the versatile coactivation profile of PGC-1a
and can readily be extended to understand other transcriptional coregulators.

Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) mediates oxygen-dependent induction of
aromatase (CYP19) gene expression during human trophoblast differentiation.

Differentiation of human cytotrophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblast and the
associated induction of aromatase/hCYP19 gene expression are dependent upon a
critical O(2) tension; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain
undefined. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that expression of the
orphan nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>), is also O(2)
dependent, induced during human syncytiotrophoblast differentiation, and plays an
obligatory role in the induction of placenta-specific hCYP19I.1 gene expression. 
Treatment with the selective ERR<U+03B3> agonist, DY131, or overexpression of ERR<U+03B3>,
stimulated hCYP19 expression in syncytiotrophoblast. Overexpression of ERR<U+03B3>
prevented effects of hypoxia to repress hCYP19 gene expression in cultured
trophoblasts. Conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous 
ERR<U+03B3> in primary trophoblasts markedly inhibited hCYP19 expression. Promoter and
site-directed mutagenesis studies in transfected placental cells identified a
nuclear receptor element within placenta-specific hCYP19 promoter I.1 required
for ERR<U+03B3>-stimulated activity. Recruitment of endogenous ERR<U+03B3> to the nuclear
receptor element region in hCYP19 promoter during trophoblast differentiation,
assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, was prevented by hypoxia.
Deferoxamine-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) levels decreased ERR<U+03B3>
expression, whereas knockdown of endogenous HIF-1a prevented ERR<U+03B3> suppression by 
hypoxia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of trophoblasts cultured in
hypoxia revealed recruitment of HIF-1a to one of two putative hypoxia response
elements in the ERR<U+03B3> promoter, providing in vivo evidence of a direct HIF-1a
involvement in ERR<U+03B3> expression. Collectively, these novel findings identify ERR<U+03B3> 
as an O(2)-dependent transcription factor and HIF-1a target gene that serves a
critical role in the induction of hCYP19 expression during human trophoblast
differentiation.

Different studies performed in rodents revealed that bisphenol-A (BPA), an
environmental compound, altered early embryonic development. However, little is
known concerning the direct effects of BPA on human implantation process. Thus,
we decided to study in vitro BPA's effects on proliferative capacities of the
human trophoblastic cell line, JEG-3. For this purpose, we first have shown that 
JEG-3 cells express the specific BPA receptor, namely estrogen-related receptor
<U+03B3>1 (ERR<U+03B3>1). Secondly, we demonstrated that BPA did not exert any cytotoxic action
in JEG-3 cells up to 10(-6)M. Moreover [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation experiments
revealed that BPA significantly reduced cell proliferation. The results also
showed that BPA induced JEG-3 apoptosis capacity as reflected by DNA
fragmentation experiments. In conclusion, we describe here the direct impact of
BPA on trophoblastic cell number mediated through both anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effects.

Estrogen-related receptor a regulates skeletal myocyte differentiation via
modulation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway.

Metabolic Diseases Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte,

Myocyte differentiation involves complex interactions between signal transduction
pathways and transcription factors. The estrogen-related receptors (ERRs)
regulate energy substrate uptake, mitochondrial respiration, and biogenesis and
may target structural gene programs in striated muscle. However, ERRa's role in
regulating myocyte differentiation is not known. ERRa and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator-1a (PGC-1a) are coordinately
upregulated with metabolic and skeletal muscle-specific genes early in
myogenesis. We analyzed effects of ERRa overexpression and loss of function in
myogenic models. In C2C12 myocytes ERRa overexpression accelerated
differentiation, whereas XCT790 treatment delayed myogenesis and resulted in
myotubes with fewer mitochondria and disorganized sarcomeres. ERRa-/- primary
myocytes showed delayed myogenesis, resulting in structurally immature myotubes
with reduced sarcomeric assembly and mitochondrial function. However, sarcomeric 
and metabolic gene expression was unaffected or upregulated in ERRa-/- cells.
Instead, ERRa-/- myocytes exhibited aberrant ERK activation early in myogenesis, 
consistent with delayed myotube formation. XCT790 treatment also increased ERK
phosphorylation in C2C12, whereas ERRa overexpression decreased early ERK
activation, consistent with the opposing effects of these treatments on
differentiation. The transient induction of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1),
which mediates ERK dephosphorylation at the onset of myogenesis, was lost in
ERRa-/- myocytes and in XCT790-treated C2C12. The ERRa-PGC-1a complex activates
the Dusp1 gene, which encodes MKP-1, and ERRa occupies the proximal 5' regulatory
region during early differentiation in C2C12 myocytes. Finally, treatment of
ERRa-/- myocytes with MEK inhibitors rescued normal ERK signaling and myogenesis.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that ERRa is required for normal skeletal
myocyte differentiation via modulation of MAP kinase signaling.

Cardiac lipin 1 expression is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator activated

Lipin family proteins (lipin 1, 2, and 3) are bifunctional intracellular proteins
that regulate metabolism by acting as coregulators of DNA-bound transcription
factors and also dephosphorylate phosphatidate to form diacylglycerol
[phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity] in the triglyceride synthesis pathway. 
Herein, we report that lipin 1 is enriched in heart and that hearts of mice
lacking lipin 1 (fld mice) exhibit accumulation of phosphatidate. We also
demonstrate that the expression of the gene encoding lipin 1 (Lpin1) is under the
control of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) and their coactivator the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> coactivator-1a (PGC-1a). PGC-1a,
ERRa, or ERR<U+03B3> overexpression increased Lpin1 transcription in cultured
ventricular myocytes and the ERRs were associated with response elements in the
first intron of the Lpin1 gene. Concomitant RNAi-mediated knockdown of ERRa and
ERR<U+03B3> abrogated the induction of lipin 1 expression by PGC-1a overexpression.
Consistent with these data, 3-fold overexpression of PGC-1a in intact myocardium 
of transgenic mice increased cardiac lipin 1 and ERRa/<U+03B3> expression. Similarly,
injection of the ß2-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol induced PGC-1a and lipin 1
expression, and the induction in lipin 1 after clenbuterol occurred in a
PGC-1a-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of PGC-1a, ERRa, ERR<U+03B3>, and lipin
1 was down-regulated in failing heart. Cardiac phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase
activity was also diminished, while cardiac phosphatidate content was increased, 
in failing heart. Collectively, these data suggest that lipin 1 is the principal 
lipin protein in the myocardium and is regulated in response to physiologic and
pathologic stimuli that impact cardiac metabolism.

Nuclear receptor SHP inhibition of Dnmt1 expression via ERR<U+03B3>.

University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States.

We describe a transcriptional mechanism regulating the expression of Dnmt1 by
nuclear receptors. We show that ERR<U+03B3> functions as a transcriptional activator of 
mouse and human Dnmt1 expression by direct binding to its response elements
(ERE1/ERE2) in the dnmt1/DNMT1 promoters. The induction of Dnmt1 by ERR<U+03B3> is
repressed by SHP through SHP inhibition of ERR<U+03B3> transactivity, diminishing ERR<U+03B3>
recruitment to the Dnmt1 promoter, and altering the conformation of local
chromatin from an active mode by ERR<U+03B3> to an inactive mode. Our study provides the
first evidence for nuclear receptor mediated regulation of Dnmt1 expression
through ERR<U+03B3> and SHP crosstalk.

Growth factor activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases to promote cell 
growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is an integral part of cell growth. How growth
factor regulates mitochondrial biogenesis is not fully understood. In this study,
we found that mitochondrial mass was specifically reduced upon serum starvation
and induced upon re-feeding with serum. Using mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinases inhibitor U0126, we found that the mRNA expression levels of ATP
synthase, cytochrome-C, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and mitofusin 2
were reduced. Since the transcriptional levels of these genes are under the
control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> coactivator-1a and -1ß
(PGC-1a and PGC-1ß), we examined and found that only the mRNA and protein levels 
of PGC-1ß were suppressed. Importantly, over-expression of PGC-1ß partially
reversed the reduction of mitochondrial mass upon U0126 treatment. Thus, we
conclude that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases direct mitochondrial
biogenesis through selectively inducing PGC-1ß expression.

Optical microplate-based biosensors combine the advantages of label-free
detection with industry-standard assay laboratory infrastructure and scalability.
A plate-based label-free platform allows the same basic platform to be used to
quantify molecular interactions of macromolecules and to screen and characterize 
drug-like small-molecule interactions. The ligand-binding domain of orphan
estrogen-related nuclear receptor-<U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is utilized, as a model system of a
challenging type of target, to illustrate the rapid development and utility of a 
range of biochemical assay formats on these biosensors. Formats in which either
the domain, or a peptide derived from its cognate corepressor, RIP140, were
immobilized were utilized. The direct binding of small drug molecules to the
domain was characterized using immobilized domain. Subsequent addition of peptide
distinguished whether compounds acted as either antagonists of peptide binding,
or as agonists promoting a ternary complex. The format with peptide immobilized
gave a more sensitive procedure for establishing the effect of compounds on the
domain-peptide interaction. Using a direct-binding format, a diverse chemical
library of 1,408 compounds in DMSO was screened for ability to bind to biosensors
coated with ERR<U+03B3> ligand-binding domain. Hits were then characterized using the
other biosensor assay formats. The standard requirements for a full primary
screening campaign were fulfilled by the acceptable hit-rate, quality-performance
parameters, and throughput of the direct-binding assay format. Such a format
allows direct screening of targets, such as orphan receptors, without the
requirement for prior knowledge of a validated ligand.

How type I skeletal muscle inherently maintains high oxidative and vascular
capacity in the absence of exercise is unclear. We show that nuclear receptor
ERR<U+03B3> is highly expressed in type I muscle and, when transgenically expressed in
anaerobic type II muscles (ERRGO mice), dually induces metabolic and vascular
transformation in the absence of exercise. ERRGO mice show increased expression
of genes promoting fat metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and type I fiber
specification. Muscles in ERRGO mice also display an activated angiogenic program
marked by myofibrillar induction and secretion of proangiogenic factors,
neovascularization, and a 100% increase in running endurance. Surprisingly, the
induction of type I muscle properties by ERR<U+03B3> does not involve PGC-1a. Instead,
ERR<U+03B3> genetically activates the energy sensor AMPK in mediating the metabovascular
changes in ERRGO mice. Therefore, ERR<U+03B3> represents a previously unrecognized
determinant that specifies intrinsic vascular and oxidative metabolic features
that distinguish type I from type II muscle.

Parkin degrades estrogen-related receptors to limit the expression of monoamine
oxidases.

Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214, USA.

Parkin, whose mutations cause Parkinson disease (PD), controls oxidative stress
by limiting the expression of monoamine oxidases (MAO)--mitochondrial enzymes
responsible for the oxidative de-amination of dopamine. Here, we show that parkin
performed this function by increasing the ubiquitination and degradation of
estrogen-related receptors (ERR), orphan nuclear receptors that play critical
roles in the transcription regulation of many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
proteins. All three ERRs (a, ß and <U+03B3>) increased the transcription of MAOs A and
B; the effects were abolished by parkin, but not by its PD-linked mutants. Parkin
bound to ERRs and increased their ubiquitination and degradation. In fibroblasts 
from PD patients with parkin mutations or brain slices from parkin knockout mice,
degradation of ERRs was significantly attenuated. The results reveal the
molecular mechanism by which parkin suppresses the transcription of MAOs to
control oxidative stress induced by dopamine oxidation.

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUTs) are common
disorders of human development affecting the renal parechyma, renal pelvis,
ureter, bladder and urethra; they show evidence of shared genetic aetiology,
although the molecular basis of this remains unknown in the majority of cases.
Breakpoint mapping of a de novo, apparently balanced, reciprocal translocation
associated with bilateral renal agenesis has implicated the gene encoding the
nuclear steroid hormone receptor ESRRG as a candidate gene for CAKUT. Here we
show that the Esrrg protein is detected throughout early ureteric ducts as
cytoplasmic/sub-membranous staining; with nuclear localization seen in developing
nephrons. In 14.5-16.5 dpc (days post-conception) mouse embryos, Esrrg localizes 
to the subset of ductal tissue within the kidney, liver and lung. The renal
ductal expression becomes localized to renal papilla by 18.5 dpc. Perturbation of
function was performed in embryonic mouse kidney culture using pooled siRNA to
induce knock-down and a specific small-molecule agonist to induce aberrant
activation of Esrrg. Both resulted in severe abnormality of early branching
events of the ureteric duct. Mouse embryos with a targeted inactivation of Esrrg 
on both alleles (Esrrg(-/-)) showed agenesis of the renal papilla but normal
development of the cortex and remaining medulla. Taken together, these results
suggest that Esrrg is required for early branching events of the ureteric duct
that occur prior to the onset of nephrogenesis. These findings confirm ESRRG as a
strong candidate gene for CAKUT.

mouse urogenital sinus.

The balance between androgens and estrogens is very important in the development 
of the prostate, and even small changes in estrogen levels, including those of
estrogen-mimicking chemicals, can lead to serious changes. Bisphenol A (BPA), an 
endocrine-disrupting chemical, is a well-known, ubiquitous, estrogenic chemical. 
To investigate the effects of fetal exposure to low-dose BPA on the development
of the prostate, we examined alterations of the in situ sex steroid hormonal
environment in the mouse urogenital sinus (UGS). In the BPA-treated UGS,
estradiol (E(2)) levels and CYP19A1 (cytochrome P450 aromatase) activity were
significantly increased compared with those of the untreated and
diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated UGS. The mRNAs of steroidogenic enzymes, Cyp19a1
and Cyp11a1, and the sex-determining gene, Nr5a1, were up-regulated specifically 
in the BPA-treated group. The up-regulation of mRNAs was observed in the
mesenchymal component of the UGS as well as in the cerebellum, heart, kidney, and
ovary but not in the testis. The number of aromatase-expressing mesenchymal cells
in the BPA-treated UGS was approximately twice that in the untreated and
DES-treated UGS. The up-regulation of Esrrg mRNA was observed in organs for which
mRNAs of steroidogenic enzymes were also up-regulated. We demonstrate here that
fetal exposure to low-dose BPA has the unique action of increasing in situ E(2)
levels and CYP19A1 (aromatase) activity in the mouse UGS. Our data suggest that
BPA might interact with in situ steroidogenesis by altering tissue components,
such as the accumulation of aromatase-expressing mesenchymal cells, in particular
organs.

Estrogen-related receptor <U+03B3> (ERR<U+03B3>) is an orphan nuclear receptor lacking
identified natural ligands. The synthetic estrogen receptor ligands
4-hydroxytamoxifen and diethylstilbestrol have, however, been shown to bind to
and abolish the constitutive transcriptional activity of ERR<U+03B3>. Certain
phytoestrogens were recently reported to act as agonists of the related ERRa. We 
investigated whether phytoestrogens also modulated the transcriptional activity
of ERR<U+03B3>. We analyzed a selection of phytoestrogens for their potential agonistic 
or antagonistic activity on ERR<U+03B3>. In transiently transfected PC-3 and U2-OS cells
equol stimulated the transcriptional activity of ERR<U+03B3> and enhanced its
interaction with the coactivator GRIP1. The agonistic effect of equol was
abolished by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Equol induced a conformational change in the
ERR<U+03B3> ligand-binding domain. Based on structural models of the ERR<U+03B3> ligand-binding
domain, we were able to introduce mutations that modulated the agonistic
potential of equol. Finally, equol enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of ERR<U+03B3> 
on the prostate cancer PC-3 cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the
phytoestrogen equol acts as an ERR<U+03B3> agonist.

miR-378(*) mediates metabolic shift in breast cancer cells via the PGC-1ß/ERR<U+03B3>
transcriptional pathway.

Cancer cell metabolism is often characterized by a shift from an oxidative to a
glycolytic bioenergetics pathway, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect.
miR-378(*) is embedded within PPARGC1b which encodes PGC-1ß, a transcriptional
regulator of oxidative energy metabolism. Here we show that miR-378(*) expression
is regulated by ERBB2 and induces a metabolic shift in breast cancer cells.
miR-378(*) performs this function by inhibiting the expression of two PGC-1ß
partners, ERR<U+03B3> and GABPA, leading to a reduction in tricarboxylic acid cycle gene
expression and oxygen consumption as well as an increase in lactate production
and in cell proliferation. In situ hybridization experiments show that miR-378(*)
expression correlates with progression of human breast cancer. These results
identify miR-378(*) as a molecular switch involved in the orchestration of the
Warburg effect in breast cancer cells via interference with a well-integrated
bioenergetics transcriptional pathway.

Breast cancer is primarily a hormone-dependent tumor that can be regulated by
status of steroid hormones including estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen-related 
receptors (ERRs) are orphan nuclear receptors most closely related to estrogen
receptor (ER) and much attention has been recently paid to the functions of ERRs 
in breast cancer in terms of the interactions with ER. In the present study, we
investigated the expression of ERR<U+03B3> in human invasive breast cancers by
immunohistochemical analysis (n=110) obtained by radical mastectomy. Nuclear
immunoreactivity of ERR<U+03B3> was detected in 87 cases (79%) and tended to correlate
with the lymph node status. No significant associations were observed with other 
clinicopathological characteristics, including the expression levels of both
estrogen and progesterone receptors. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we
demonstrated that ERR<U+03B3> mRNA was up-regulated dose-dependently by estrogen, and
that this up-regulation of ERR<U+03B3> mRNA by estrogen was abolished by ICI 182,780
treatment. We also demonstrated that exogenously transfected ERR<U+03B3> increased MCF-7
cell proliferation. Furthermore, ERR<U+03B3> enhanced estrogen response element
(ERE)-driven transcription in MCF-7 cells. In 293T cells, ERR<U+03B3> could also
stimulate ERE-mediated transcription with or without ERa. These results suggest
that ERR<U+03B3> plays an important role as a modulator of estrogen signaling in breast 
cancer cells.

A PPARa promoter variant impairs ERR-dependent transactivation and decreases
mortality after acute coronary ischemia in patients with diabetes.

Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa) occurs in 
animal models of diabetes (DM) and is implicated in pathological responses to
myocardial ischemia. Using bioinformatics, we identified a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the PPARa gene promoter (PPARA -54,642 G>A; rs135561) that 
altered the consensus sequence for a nuclear receptor binding site.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the domain bound two known
PPARA transcriptional activators, estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-a and -<U+03B3> and
that PPARA G bound with greater affinity than PPARA A (>2-fold; P<0.05).
Likewise, promoter-reporter analyses showed enhanced transcriptional activity for
PPARA G vs. PPARA A for both ERR-a and -<U+03B3> (3.1 vs.1.9-fold; P<0.05). Since PPARa 
activation impairs post-ischemic cardiac function in experimental models of DM,
we tested whether decreased PPARA transcription in PPARA A carriers favorably
impacted outcome after acute coronary ischemia in 705 patients hospitalized with 
acute coronary syndromes (ACS; 552 Caucasian, 106 African American). PPARA A
allele frequencies were similar to non-diseased subjects. However, PPARA genotype
correlated with 5-year mortality in diabetic (22.2% AA vs. 18.8% AG vs. 39.5% GG;
P = 0.008), but not non-diabetic (P = 0.96) subjects (genotype by diabetes
interaction P = 0.008). In the diabetic ACS subjects, PPARA A carriers had
strikingly reduced all-cause mortality compared to PPARA G homozygotes,
(unadjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.75; P = 0.003; adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI
0.27-0.83; P = 0.009). Consistent with previous descriptions of PPARa in
experimental models and human disease, we describe a novel PPARA promoter SNP
that decreases transcriptional activation of PPARA and protects against mortality
in diabetic patients after ACS.

Bilateral renal agenesis/hypoplasia/dysplasia (BRAHD): postmortem analysis of 45 
cases with breakpoint mapping of two de novo translocations.

BACKGROUND: Bilateral renal agenesis/hypoplasia/dysplasia (BRAHD) is a relatively
common, lethal malformation in humans. Established clinical risk factors include 
maternal insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and male sex of the fetus. In the
majority of cases, no specific etiology can be established, although teratogenic,
syndromal and single gene causes can be assigned to some cases.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 45 unrelated fetuses, stillbirths or infants with
lethal BRAHD were ascertained through a single regional paediatric pathology
service (male:female 34:11 or 3.1:1). The previously reported phenotypic overlaps
with VACTERL, caudal dysgenesis, hemifacial microsomia and Müllerian defects were
confirmed. A new finding is that 16/45 (35.6%; m:f 13:3 or 4.3:1) BRAHD cases had
one or more extrarenal malformations indicative of a disoder of laterality
determination including; incomplete lobulation of right lung (seven cases),
malrotation of the gut (seven cases) and persistence of the left superior vena
cava (five cases). One such case with multiple laterality defects and sirelomelia
was found to have a de novo apparently balanced reciprocal translocation
46,XY,t(2;6)(p22.3;q12). Translocation breakpoint mapping was performed by
interphase fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) using nuclei extracted from
archival tissue sections in both this case and an isolated bilateral renal
agenesis case associated with a de novo 46,XY,t(1;2)(q41;p25.3). Both t(2;6)
breakpoints mapped to gene-free regions with no strong evidence of cis-regulatory
potential. Ten genes localized within 500 kb of the t(1;2) breakpoints.
Wholemount in-situ expression analyses of the mouse orthologs of these genes in
embryonic mouse kidneys showed strong expression of Esrrg, encoding a nuclear
steroid hormone receptor. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Esrrg was
restricted to proximal ductal tissue within the embryonic kidney.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The previously unreported association of BRAHD with
laterality defects suggests that renal agenesis may share a common etiology with 
heterotaxy in some cases. Translocation breakpoint mapping identified ESRRG as a 
plausible candidate gene for BRAHD.

We describe a systems biology approach for the genetic dissection of complex
traits based on applying gene network theory to the results from genome-wide
associations. The associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that were
individually associated with a primary phenotype of interest, age at puberty in
our study, were explored across 22 related traits. Genomic regions were surveyed 
for genes harboring the selected SNP. As a result, an association weight matrix
(AWM) was constructed with as many rows as genes and as many columns as traits.
Each {i, j} cell value in the AWM corresponds to the z-score normalized additive 
effect of the ith gene (via its neighboring SNP) on the jth trait. Columnwise,
the AWM recovered the genetic correlations estimated via pedigree-based
restricted maximum-likelihood methods. Rowwise, a combination of hierarchical
clustering, gene network, and pathway analyses identified genetic drivers that
would have been missed by standard genome-wide association studies. Finally, the 
promoter regions of the AWM-predicted targets of three key transcription factors 
(TFs), estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG), Pal3 motif, bound by a PPAR-gamma
homodimer, IR3 sites (PPARG), and Prophet of Pit 1, PROP paired-like homeobox 1
(PROP1), were surveyed to identify binding sites corresponding to those TFs.
Applied to our case, the AWM results recapitulate the known biology of puberty,
captured experimentally validated binding sites, and identified candidate genes
and gene-gene interactions for further investigation.

Genome-wide gain-of-function screen identifies novel regulators of pluripotency.

92037, USA.

Pluripotent stem cells are characterized by the capacity to self-renew and to
differentiate into all the cell types of the body. To identify novel regulators
of pluripotency, we screened cDNA libraries (>30,000 clones) in P19 embryonal
carcinoma cells for factors that modulate the expression of a luciferase reporter
driven by the promoter of the pluripotency master regulator Nanog. Ninety
confirmed hits activated the reporter and 14 confirmed hits inhibited the
reporter by more than two-fold. The identified hits were evaluated by gain- and
loss-of-functions approaches. The reporter-activating hits Timp2, Hig2, and
Mki67ip promoted embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal when episomally
overexpressed in ES cells, whereas the reporter-inhibiting hits PU.1/Spi1,
Prkaca, and Jun induced differentiation of ES cells. Conversely, the knockdown of
the activating hits Timp2, Mki67ip, Esrrg, and Dusp7 in ES cells induced
differentiation, whereas the knockdown of the reporter-inhibiting hit PU.1/Spi1
led to inhibition of differentiation. One of the novel hits, the RNA-binding
protein Mki67ip was further characterized, and found to be overexpressed in ES
cells and in early development and downregulated during differentiation. The
knockdown of Mki67ip led to the differentiation of ES cells, decreased growth
rate, reduction in pluripotency markers, and induction of lineage-specific
markers. In addition, colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments
suggest that Mki67ip promotes ES cell self-renewal via a mechanism involving
nucleophosmin, a multifunctional nucleolar protein upregulated in stem cells and 
cancer.

Bisphenol A (BPA) strongly binds to human estrogen-related receptor gamma
(ERRgamma). BPA is an oestrogenic endocrine disruptor that influences various
physiological functions at very low doses. BPA functions as an inverse-type
antagonist of ERRgamma to retain its high basal constitutive activity by
inhibiting the deactivating inverse agonist activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-OHT). We recently demonstrated that ERRgamma receptor residues Glu275 and
Arg316 function as the intrinsic binding site of BPA's phenol-hydroxyl group. We 
also determined the chief importance of phenol-hydroxyl<-->Arg316 hydrogen
bonding and the corroborative role of phenol-hydroxyl<-->Glu275 hydrogen bonding.
However, there appeared to be a distinct difference between the receptor binding 
modes of BPA and 4-OHT. In the present study, using tritium-labelled or
non-labelled BPA and 4-OHT, we evaluated in detail the receptor binding
capabilities of wild-type ERRgamma and its mutants with amino acid alterations at
positions 275 and 316. Both compounds exhibited a strong binding ability to
wild-type ERRgamma due to the hydrogen bonding to Glu275 and Arg316. However,
4-OHT revealed significantly reduced occupancy for both wild-type and mutant
receptors. The data obtained suggest that 4-OHT barely binds to ERRgamma due to
the strong ability of Glu275 and Arg316 to recruit phenol compounds.

The ligand binding domains of the estrogen related receptors, ERRalpha and
ERRgamma were covalently immobilized onto the surface of an aminopropyl silica
liquid chromatography stationary phase to create the ERRalpha-silica and
ERRgamma-silica columns and onto the surface of open tubular capillaries to
create the ERRalpha-OT and ERRgamma-OT columns. The ERR-silica and ERR-OT columns
were characterized using frontal chromatographic techniques with
diethylstibesterol and the binding affinities, K(d) values, to the immobilized
receptors were consistent with the values obtained by a radioligand binding
assay. The ERRgamma-silica column was also characterized using non-linear
chromatographic techniques using a series of tamoxifen derivatives. The relative 
K(d) values obtained for the derivatives were consistent with the relative
ability of the compounds to inhibit the cellular proliferation of the
human-derived T98G glioma cell line, expressed as IC(50) values. The results
indicate that the columns containing immobilized ERRalpha and ERRgamma can be

Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) regulates the perinatal switch to
oxidative metabolism in the myocardium. We wanted to understand the significance 
of induction of ERRgamma expression in skeletal muscle by exercise.
Muscle-specific VP16ERRgamma transgenic mice demonstrated an increase in exercise
capacity, mitochondrial enzyme activity, and enlarged mitochondria despite lower 
muscle weights. Furthermore, peak oxidative capacity was higher in the
transgenics as compared with control littermates. In contrast, mice lacking one
copy of ERRgamma exhibited decreased exercise capacity and muscle mitochondrial
function. Interestingly, we observed that increased ERRgamma in muscle generates 
a gene expression profile that closely overlays that of red oxidative fiber-type 
muscle. We further demonstrated that a small molecule agonist of ERRbeta/gamma
can increase mitochondrial function in mouse myotubes. Our data indicate that
ERRgamma plays an important role in causing a shift toward slow twitch muscle
type and, concomitantly, a greater capacity for endurance exercise. Thus, the
activation of this nuclear receptor provides a potential node for therapeutic
intervention for diseases such as obesity, which is associated with reduced
oxidative metabolism and a lower type I fiber content in skeletal muscle.

Estrogen-related receptor (ERR) is a nuclear receptor that modulates the
estrogen-signaling pathway. Here, we investigated the expression of both ERRbeta 
and ERRgamma in human prostate tissues. Using original rabbit polyclonal
anti-ERRbeta and anti-ERRgamma antibodies, the expression of ERRbeta and ERRgamma
was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of cancerous lesions (n = 107) and 
benign foci (n = 92), obtained by radical prostatectomy. Stained slides were
evaluated for the proportion of immunoreactive cells and their staining
intensity. Total immunoreactivity scores (IR scores; range, 0-8) were calculated 
as the sum of the proportion and intensity scores. The relationship between the
clinicopathological characteristics of the patients and the expression of the
three ERRs (ERRalpha, ERR beta, and ERR gamma) was evaluated. IR scores for
ERRbeta and ERRgamma were significantly lower in cancerous lesions than that in
benign foci (P < 0.0001, for both). Clinicopathological analyses revealed that
the patients with low ERRgamma IR scores (<or=4) tended to show poor
cancer-specific survival (P = 0.07). Then, we used data from our previous study
(Fujimura T., Int J Cancer, 2007; 120: 2325-30). Patients with a high IR score
for ERRalpha and a low score for ERRgamma showed significantly poorer
cancer-specific survival than those with a low IR score for ERRalpha and a high
score for ERRgamma (P = 0.0003). We demonstrated the differential expression of
ERRbeta and ERRgamma in prostate tissue. The combined evaluation of the
expression of ERRalpha and ERRgamma could be a significant prognostic factor for 
prostate cancer.

Energy production by oxidative metabolism in kidney, stomach, and heart, is
primarily expended in establishing ion gradients to drive renal electrolyte
homeostasis, gastric acid secretion, and cardiac muscle contraction,
respectively. In addition to orchestrating transcriptional control of oxidative
metabolism, the orphan nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma
(ERRgamma), coordinates expression of genes central to ion homeostasis in
oxidative tissues. Renal, gastric, and cardiac tissues subjected to genomic
analysis of expression in perinatal ERRgamma null mice revealed a characteristic 
dysregulation of genes involved in transport processes, exemplified by the
voltage-gated potassium channel, Kcne2. Consistently, ERRgamma null animals die
during the first 72 h of life with elevated serum potassium, reductions in key
gastric acid production markers, and cardiac arrhythmia with prolonged QT
intervals. In addition, we find altered expression of several genes associated
with hypertension in ERRgamma null mice. These findings suggest a potential role 
for genetic polymorphisms at the ERRgamma locus and ERRgamma modulators in the
etiology and treatment of renal, gastric, and cardiac dysfunction.

Role of Esrrg in the fibrate-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism genes in
human ApoA-I transgenic mice.

Athens.

We have used a new ApoA-I transgenic mouse model to identify by global gene
expression profiling, candidate genes that affect lipid and lipoprotein
metabolism in response to fenofibrate treatment. Multilevel bioinformatical
analysis and stringent selection criteria (2-fold change, 0% false discovery
rate) identified 267 significantly changed genes involved in several molecular
pathways. The fenofibrate-treated group did not have significantly altered levels
of hepatic human APOA-I mRNA and plasma ApoA-I compared with the control group.
However, the treatment increased cholesterol levels to 1.95-fold mainly due to
the increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The observed changes 
in HDL are associated with the upregulation of genes involved in phospholipid
biosynthesis and lipid hydrolysis, as well as phospholipid transfer protein.
Significant upregulation was observed in genes involved in fatty acid transport
and beta-oxidation, but not in those of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, 
Krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis. Fenofibrate changed significantly the expression
of seven transcription factors. The estrogen receptor-related gamma gene was
upregulated 2.36-fold and had a significant positive correlation with genes of
lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and mitochondrial functions, indicating an
important role of this orphan receptor in mediating the fenofibrate-induced
activation of a specific subset of its target genes.

Structural activity relationship of flavonoids with estrogen-related receptor
gamma.

In this study, we investigated the structural activity relationships (SARs) of
flavonoids with estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) and its coactivator
peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha
(PGC-1alpha). Isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and flavanones (naringenin and
hesperetin) did not significantly affect ERRgamma activity. Flavone apigenin and 
flavonol kaempferol directly suppressed the interaction between ERRgamma and
PGC-1alpha functioning as inverse agonists. In contrast, flavone luteolin
suppressed PGC-1alpha activity in part through promoting the degradation of
PGC-1alpha leading to suppressed ERRgamma activity. Therefore, these flavones and
flavonols utilize alternative mechanisms to influence the transcriptional
activities of ERRgamma and PGC-1alpha.

The purpose of this study was to examine expression and function of estrogen
receptor-related receptors (ERRs) in human glioma and astrocytoma cell lines.
These estrogen receptor-negative cell lines expressed ERRalpha and ERRgamma
proteins to varying degree in a cell context dependent manner, with U87MG glioma 
cells expressing both orphan nuclear receptors. Cell proliferation assays were
performed in the presence of ERR isoform-specific agonists and antagonists, and
the calculated EC(50) and IC(50) values were consistent with previous reported
values determined in other types of cancer cell lines. Induction of luciferase
expression under the control of ERR isoform-specific promoters was also observed 
in these cells. These results indicate that ERRalpha and ERRgamma are
differentially expressed in these tumor cell lines and likely contribute to
agonist-dependent ERR transcriptional activity.

Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), a
highly heritable polygenic trait. Women are more prone than men to develop
osteoporosis owing to a lower peak bone mass and accelerated bone loss at
menopause. Lack of estrogen thus is a major risk factor for osteoporosis. In
addition to having strong similarity to the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), the
orphan nuclear estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRgamma) is widely expressed
and shows overlap with ESR1 expression in tissues where estrogen has important
physiologic functions. For these reasons, we have undertaken a study of ESRRgamma
sequence variants in association with bone measurements [heel quantitative
ultrasound (QUS) by measurements of broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed
of sound (SOS), and stiffness index (SI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) at the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS)]. A silent variant was found
to be associated with multiple bone measurements (LS, BUA, SOS, and SI), the p
values ranging from .006 to .04 in a sample of 5144 Quebec women. The region of
this variant was analyzed using the HapMap database and the Gabriel method to
define a block of 20 kb. Using the Tagger method, eight TagSNPs were identified
and genotyped in a sample of 1335 women. Four of these SNPs capture the five
major block haplotypes. One SNP (rs2818964) and one haplotype were significantly 
associated with multiple bone measures. All SNPs involved in the associations
were analyzed in two other sample sets with significant results in the same
direction. These results suggest involvement of ESRRgamma in the determination of
bone density in women.

With the goal of discovering a selective agonist of estrogen-related receptor
gamma (ERRgamma) with enhanced potency, we designed a series of small-molecule
ligands derived from a known ERRgamma agonist, GSK4716, that can substantially
potentiate the transcriptional activity of ERRgamma. Individual compounds among a
30-member library of acyl hydrazones were pre-evaluated through in silico docking
studies on the receptor cavities of ERRgamma LBDs using X-ray crystal structures 
cocrystallized with GSK4716 and 4-OHT. This rational approach to achieve the
enhanced potency in ERRgamma transcriptional activity with selectivity over
ERRalpha/beta enables us to complete the construction of a focused library by
carrying out microwave-assisted parallel synthesis with excellent yields and
purities. Finally, we identified a more potent ERRgamma agonist, E6, with
excellent selectivity over ERRalpha/beta.

Spinal motor neurons are specified to innervate different muscle targets through 
combinatorial programs of transcription factor expression. Whether
transcriptional programs also establish finer aspects of motor neuron subtype
identity, notably the prominent functional distinction between alpha and gamma
motor neurons, remains unclear. In this study, we identify DNA binding proteins
with complementary expression profiles in alpha and gamma motor neurons,
providing evidence for molecular distinctions in these two motor neuron subtypes.
The transcription factor Err3 is expressed at high levels in gamma but not alpha 
motor neurons, whereas the neuronal DNA binding protein NeuN marks alpha but not 
gamma motor neurons. Signals from muscle spindles are needed to support the
differentiation of Err3(on)/NeuN(off) presumptive gamma motor neurons, whereas
direct proprioceptive sensory input to a motor neuron pool is apparently
dispensable. Together, these findings provide evidence that transcriptional
programs define functionally distinct motor neuron subpopulations, even within
anatomically defined motor pools.

An ERRbeta/gamma agonist modulates GRalpha expression, and glucocorticoid
responsive gene expression in skeletal muscle cells.

Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) are constitutively active orphan nuclear
receptors. Natural ligands have not been identified, however, recent reports have
demonstrated the synthetic phenolic acyl hydrazone, GSK4716, functions as a
selective ERRbeta/gamma agonist. We demonstrate that ERRbeta is transiently
induced, and ERRgamma is dramatically induced (and accumulates) in a
differentiation-dependent manner in skeletal muscle cells. Treatment of
differentiated skeletal muscle cells with the ERRbeta/gamma agonist (GSK4716)
produced a significant increase in the expression of GRalpha (isoform D) protein.
Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis after treatment with GSK4716, revealed
induction of the mRNAs encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),
11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), the enzyme that
converts inactive cortisone to cortisol and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
expression (H6PDH) that stimulates oxoreduction by 11beta-HSD1. Candidate based
expression profiling also demonstrated the mRNAs encoding characterized GR target
genes, including C/EBP, ApoD and Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) are induced in
GSK4716 treated cells. In concordance with these observations, siRNA-mediated
suppression of the mRNA encoding ERRgamma (but not ERRalpha and beta) attenuated 
the expression of mRNAs encoding GR, 11betaHSD1 and GR target gene(s). Similarly,
treatment with the ERRgamma (and ERalpha) antagonist diethylstilbestrol (DES)
suppressed glucocorticoid responsive gene expression in skeletal muscle cells.
Interestingly, we observed that GSK4716 trans-activated GRE-TK-LUC in a
GR-dependent manner. This study highlights the regulatory crosstalk between
ERRgamma and GR signaling in skeletal muscle cells, and suggests the ERRgamma
agonist modulates the expression of critical genes that control GR signaling and 
glucocorticoid sensitive gene expression.

Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) occurs in at least 1 in 10 000 live births but may
be more common in utero. Its causes are poorly understood but a number of
affected cases are associated with chromosomal abnormalities. We set out to
localize the breakpoints in a patient with sporadic HLH and a de novo
translocation. Initial studies showed that the apparently simple 1q41;3q27.1
translocation was actually combined with a 4-Mb inversion, also de novo, of
material within 1q41. We therefore localized all four breakpoints and found that 
no known transcription units were disrupted. However we present a case, based on 
functional considerations, synteny and position of highly conserved non-coding
sequence elements, and the heterozygous Prox1(+/-) mouse phenotype (ventricular
hypoplasia), for the involvement of dysregulation of the PROX1 gene in the
aetiology of HLH in this case. Accordingly, we show that the spatial expression
pattern of PROX1 in the developing human heart is consistent with a role in
cardiac development. We suggest that dysregulation of PROX1 gene expression due
to separation from its conserved upstream elements is likely to have caused the
heart defects observed in this patient, and that PROX1 should be considered as a 
potential candidate gene for other cases of HLH. The relevance of another
breakpoint separating the cardiac gene ESRRG from a conserved downstream element 
is also discussed.

Validation of low-volume 1536-well assay-ready compound plates.

Author information:

Assay-ready compound plates (ARPs) are sealed assay plates that contain DMSO
solutions of screening compounds predispensed for particular assays. Assays are
started by adding assay buffer and reagents to the ARPs. This concept offers
important logistical advantages for screening such as decoupling of the plate
preparation from the screening process and exchange of assay plates between
different geographical locations. Compound solutions can be accurately and
precisely dispensed by acoustic droplet ejection technology in the small volumes 
required for screening in the 1536-well format. At such low volumes, however,
potential effects such as solvent evaporation, compound degradation,
precipitation, or adsorption are reasons for concern with regard to assay
reproducibility, performance, and shelf life of ARPs. To address these concerns, 
the authors screened freshly prepared ARPs using several types of assays. The
results were compared to results obtained from plates stored for up to 13 days
under 2 storage conditions (22 degrees C, -18 degrees C). Tight correlations
between results were found that indicated that temperature and time had very
little influence on the assay performance for up to about 1 week storage time of 
the plates. In addition, using a time series of microphotographs of DMSO
droplets, the authors visually confirmed that the sizes of the droplets in ARPs
apparently do not change over 13 days under certain storage conditions.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a component of polycarbonate and other plastics including
resins that line food and beverage containers. BPA is known to leach from
products in contact with food and drink, and is therefore thought to be routinely
ingested. In a recent cross sectional study, BPA was detected in urine samples
from 92.6% of the US population examined. The potential for BPA to influence body
weight is suggested by in vitro studies demonstrating effects of BPA on adipocyte
differentiation, lipid accumulation, glucose transport and adiponectin secretion.
Data from in vivo studies have revealed dose-dependent and sex dependent effects 
on body weight in rodents exposed perinatally to BPA. The mechanisms through
which perinatal BPA exposure acts to exert persistent effects on body weight and 
adiposity remain to be determined. Possible targets of BPA action are discussed.

Estrogen and its metabolites are believed to play important roles in breast
cancer, and its determinants include both genetic and lifestyle factors. The
objective of the study is to investigate the association of breast cancer risk in
Thailand with genetic polymorphisms in several genes involved in estrogen
synthesis and metabolism. Five hundred and seventy patients with
histopathologically confirmed breast cancer and 497 controls were included in the
present study. Forty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP1A1,
CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP17, CYP19, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, AhR, ESR1, PGR, ERRG, COMT,
HSD17B1, HSD17B2, EPHX1 and NQO1 genes were genotyped. Association of genotypes
with breast cancer risk was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression,
which suggested an altered risk for the following SNPs [gene, odds ratio (OR) and
95% confidence interval are shown]: heterozygote carriers of rs4917623 [CYP2C19, 
OR = 1.38 (1.04-1.84)], rs2066853 [AhR, OR = 1.34 (1.02-1.76)] and rs1857407
[ERRG, (OR = 0.72 (0.55-0.96)]; homozygote carriers of rs762551 [CYP1A2, OR =
2.75 (1.47-5.14)], rs4917623 [CYP2C19, OR = 1.48 (1.00-2.19) and rs945453 [ERRG, 
OR = 1.66 (1.04-2.65)]. In addition, a stratified analysis by menopausal status
indicated that the association of the CYP1A2 (rs762551) and CYP17 (rs743572)
polymorphisms with breast cancer risk were mainly evident in premenopausal, while
ERRG (rs1857407) was significant in postmenopausal women. These findings suggest 
that CYP1A2, CYP2C19, AhR, ERRG and CYP17 polymorphisms may play an important
role in estrogen metabolism and modify individual susceptibility to breast cancer
in Thai women.

Estrogen receptor-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma/ERR3/NR3B3) is a member of the
orphan nuclear receptor with important functions in development and homeostasis. 
Recently it has been reported that ERRalpha is involved in osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation. In the present study we examined the role of 
ERRgamma in osteoblast differentiation. Here, we showed that ERRgamma is
expressed in osteoblast progenitors and primary osteoblasts, and its expression
is increased temporarily by BMP2. Overexpression of ERRgamma reduced BMP2-induced
alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production as well as calcified
nodule formation, whereas inhibition of ERRgamma expression significantly
enhanced BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, suggesting
that endogenous ERRgamma plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation.
In addition, ERRgamma significantly repressed Runx2 transactivity on osteocalcin 
and bone sialoprotein promoters. We also observed that ERRgamma physically
interacts with Runx2 in vitro and in vivo and competes with p300 to repress Runx2
transactivity. Notably, intramuscular injection of ERRgamma strongly inhibited
BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together,
these results suggest that ERRgamma is a novel negative regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation via its regulation of Runx2 transactivity.

Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma), one of the 48 human nuclear
receptors, has a fully active conformation with no ligand. We recently
demonstrated that ERRgamma binds strongly bisphenol A (BPA), one of the nastiest 
endocrine disruptors, and thus retaining ERRgamma's high basal constitutive
activity. A report that BPA accumulates in the human maternal-fetal placental
unit has led us to hypothesize that a large amount of ERRgamma might exist in the
human placenta. Here we report evidence that placenta indeed expresses ERRgamma
exceptionally strongly. We first ascertained the presence of nine different
ERRgamma mRNA variants and the resulting three ERRgamma protein isoforms. By
real-time PCR, we estimated the relative amount of ERRgamma mRNA using total RNA 
extracts from human reproductive tissues. Placenta was found to express ERRgamma 
extremely highly. Among the three ERRgamma protein isoforms, placenta exclusively
expresses the type-1 isoform, which possesses additional 23-mer amino-acid
residues at the N-terminus of the ordinary ERRgamma. This N-terminal elongation
was found to elevate by approximately 50% the basal constitutive activity of
ERRgamma, as evidenced in the luciferase reporter gene assay. The present results

Kaempferol is a dietary flavonoid that is thought to function as a selective
estrogen receptor modulator. In this study, we established that kaempferol also
functions as an inverse agonist for estrogen-related receptors alpha and gamma
(ERRalpha and ERRgamma). We demonstrated that kaempferol binds to ERRalpha and
ERRgamma and blocks their interaction with coactivator peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Kaempferol
also suppressed the expressions of ERR-target genes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
2 and 4 (PDK2 and PDK4). This evidence suggests that kaempferol may exert some of
its biological effect through both estrogen receptors and estrogen-related
receptors.

Some organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are suspected of modulating the endocrine
systems of humans. Aspects of neuro-endocrine system modulation include
interactions such as agonism or antagonism of estrogen receptor (ER) binding.
However, less is known about their interactions with other nuclear receptors
(NRs). The objectives of this study were to determine and compare the ability of 
p,p'-dichlorodiphenylethane (p,p'-DDE), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(p,p'-DDT), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and r-hexachlorocyclohexane (r-HCH) to
interact with ERalpha, androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR) and
estrogen-related receptor (ERRgamma) using a set of recombined yeast strains
expressing beta-galactosidase, under control of ERalpha, AR, PR or ERRgamma. The 
results showed that p,p'-DDE was an ERalpha agonist, AR and PR antagonist
(PR>AR), while p,p'-DDT was an ERalpha agonist and AR antagonist. HCB and r-HCH
were antagonists for AR and ERRgamma, while r-HCH was a PR antagonist and a weak 
antagonist of ERRgamma, and was able to reverse the ERRgamma inhibition induced
by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. All the results suggested that, for the tested OCPs, their
ability to act as endocrine disruptors involves more than one mechanism, their
(anti-)agonistic effects on different receptors should not be overlooked, and the
potential for additive or synergistic effects must be taken into consideration in
the risk assessment process.

One-third of all estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors treated with
endocrine therapy fail to respond, and the remainder is likely to relapse in the 
future. Almost all data on endocrine resistance has been obtained in models of
invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). However, invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC)
comprise up to 15% of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers each year and,
whereas the incidence of IDC has remained relatively constant during the last 20 
years, the prevalence of ILC continues to increase among postmenopausal women. We
report a new model of Tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant invasive lobular breast carcinoma
cells that provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of endocrine
resistance. SUM44 cells express ER and are sensitive to the growth inhibitory
effects of antiestrogens. Selection for resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen led to
the development of the SUM44/LCCTam cell line, which exhibits decreased
expression of ERalpha and increased expression of the estrogen-related receptor
gamma (ERRgamma). Knockdown of ERRgamma in SUM44/LCCTam cells by siRNA restores
TAM sensitivity, and overexpression of ERRgamma blocks the growth-inhibitory
effects of TAM in SUM44 and MDA-MB-134 VI lobular breast cancer cells.
ERRgamma-driven transcription is also increased in SUM44/LCCTam, and inhibition
of activator protein 1 (AP1) can restore or enhance TAM sensitivity. These data
support a role for ERRgamma/AP1 signaling in the development of TAM resistance
and suggest that expression of ERRgamma may be a marker of poor TAM response.

Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) is an orphan nuclear receptor that
regulates cellular energy metabolism by modulating gene expression involved in
oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis in brown adipose tissue and
heart. However, the physiological role of ERRgamma in adipogenesis and the
development of white adipose tissue has not been well studied. Here we show that 
ERRgamma was up-regulated in murine mesenchyme-derived cells, especially in ST2
and C3H10T1/2 cells, at mRNA levels under the adipogenic differentiation
condition including the inducer of cAMP, glucocorticoid, and insulin. The
up-regulation of ERRgamma mRNA was also observed in inguinal white adipose and
brown adipose tissues of mice fed a high-fat diet. Gene knockdown by
ERRgamma-specific siRNA results in mRNA down-regulation of adipogenic marker
genes including fatty acid binding protein 4, PPARgamma, and PGC-1beta in a
preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mesenchymal ST2 and C3H10T1/2
cells in the adipogenesis medium. In contrast, stable expression of ERRgamma in
3T3-L1 cells resulted in up-regulation of these adipogenic marker genes under the
adipogenic condition. These results suggest that ERRgamma positively regulate the
adipocyte differentiation with modulating the expression of various
adipogenesis-related genes.

The ERR's (estrogen receptor-related receptors) are constitutive activators of
the classical estrogen response element. In this report, we demonstrate that
ERRgamma is highly expressed in the nervous system of the developing mouse embryo
and that the adult pattern of expression of ERRgamma is, with few exceptions,
established during embryogenesis. Transcripts are preferentially detected in
already differentiating areas of the nervous system.

To elucidate estrogen functions, the expression of the estrogen receptor-related 
receptor ERRgamma, a novel orphan nuclear receptor regulating transcription via
estrogen responsive elements, has been localized by in situ hybridization in
adult murine brain. ERRgamma transcripts were abundantly present in the
isocortex, the olfactory system, cranial nerve nuclei and major parts of the
coordination centers, e.g. reticular formation and major parts of the
extrapyramidal motor systems. In addition, ERRgamma expression was detected in
trigeminal ganglion neurons. ERRgamma distribution was clearly distinguished from
that described for ERRalpha, for ERRbeta, and for estrogen receptors (ER)
pointing at functional differences between ERRgamma and these receptors.

Estrogen receptor-related receptors (ERRs) are orphan members of the nuclear
receptor superfamily, closely related to the estrogen receptor. With a PCR-based 
cloning strategy we have identified two cDNA isoforms from a neonatal mouse whole
brain cDNA library encoding ERRgamma. We show that alternative splicing gives
rise to different 5'-ends. The predicted peptide sequence of ERRgamma2 differs
from ERRgamma1 by additional 23 N-terminal residues. The presence of identical
isoforms in human suggests a pivotal function of ERRgamma in mammalia. Northern
blot analysis reveals that ERRgamma is expressed as early as day 11 of embryonic 
development (E11). Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis shows major
expression of ERRgamma in the central nervous system at E12.5. In the adult mouse
a 5.7 kb transcript is detected in heart, brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle.
Therefore, ERRgamma may be involved in the differentiation, as well as the
maintenance of the differentiated properties in the brain.

Hormone-independent transcriptional activation and coactivator binding by novel
orphan nuclear receptor ERR3.

Orphan nuclear receptors share sequence homology with members of the nuclear
receptor superfamily, but ligands are unknown or unnecessary. A novel orphan
receptor, estrogen receptor-related protein 3 (ERR3), was identified by yeast
two-hybrid screening, using the transcriptional coactivator glucocorticoid
receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) as bait. The putative full-length mouse
ERR3 contains 458 amino acids and is closely related to two known orphan
receptors ERR1 and ERR2. All the ERR family members share an almost identical
DNA-binding domain, which has 68% amino acid identity with that of estrogen
receptor. ERR3 bound specifically to an estrogen response element and activated
reporter genes controlled by estrogen response elements, both in yeast and in
mammalian cells, in the absence of any added ligand. A conserved AF-2 activation 
domain located in the hormone-binding domain of ERR3 was primarily responsible
for transcriptional activation. The ERR3 AF-2 domain bound GRIP1 in a
ligand-independent manner both in vitro and in vivo, through the LXXLL motifs of 
GRIP1, and GRIP1 functioned as a transcriptional coactivator for ERR3 in both
yeast and mammalian cells. Expression of ERR3 in adult mouse was restricted;
highest expression was observed in heart, kidney, and brain. In the mouse embryo 
no expression was observed at day 7, and highest expression occurred around the
11-15 day stages. Although ERR3 is much more closely related to ERR2 than to
ERR1, the expression pattern for ERR3 was similar to that of ERR1 and distinct
from that for ERR2, suggesting a unique role for ERR3 in development.
