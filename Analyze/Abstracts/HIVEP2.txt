Human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer binding protein 2 (HIVEP2) has been 
previously associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay in
three patients. Here, we describe six patients with developmental delay,
intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features with de novo likely
gene-damaging variants in HIVEP2 identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES).
HIVEP2 encodes a large transcription factor that regulates various
neurodevelopmental pathways. Our findings provide further evidence that
pathogenic variants in HIVEP2 lead to intellectual disabilities and developmental
delay.

Intellectual disability (ID) affects 2-3% of the population. In the past, many
genetic causes of ID remained unidentified due to its vast heterogeneity.
Recently, whole exome sequencing (WES) studies have shown that de novo variants
underlie a significant portion of sporadic cases of ID. Applying WES to patients 
with ID or global developmental delay at different centers, we identified three
individuals with distinct de novo variants in HIVEP2 (human immunodeficiency
virus type I enhancer binding protein), which belongs to a family of
zinc-finger-containing transcriptional proteins involved in growth and
development. Two of the variants were nonsense changes, and one was a 1<U+2009>bp
deletion resulting in a premature stop codon that was reported previously without
clinical detail. In silico prediction programs suggest loss-of-function in the
mutated allele leading to haploinsufficiency as a putative mechanism in all three
individuals. All three patients presented with moderate-to-severe ID, minimal
structural brain anomalies, hypotonia, and mild dysmorphic features. Growth
parameters were in the normal range except for borderline microcephaly at birth
in one patient. Two of the patients exhibited behavioral anomalies including
hyperactivity and aggression. Published functional data suggest a
neurodevelopmental role for HIVEP2, and several of the genes regulated by HIVEP2 
are implicated in brain development, for example, SSTR-2, c-Myc, and genes of the
NF-<U+03BA>B pathway. In addition, HIVEP2-knockout mice exhibit several working memory
deficits, increased anxiety, and hyperactivity. On the basis of the
genotype-phenotype correlation and existing functional data, we propose HIVEP2 as
a causative ID gene.

OBJECTIVE: Immune-related abnormalities are commonly reported in schizophrenia,
including higher mRNA levels for the viral restriction factor interferon-induced 
transmembrane protein (IFITM) in the prefrontal cortex. The authors sought to
clarify whether higher IFITM mRNA levels and other immune-related disturbances in
the prefrontal cortex are the consequence of an ongoing molecular cascade
contributing to immune activation or the reflection of a long-lasting maladaptive
response to an in utero immune-related insult.
METHOD: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure mRNA
levels for immune-related cytokines and transcriptional regulators, including
those reported to regulate IFITM expression, in the prefrontal cortex from 62
schizophrenia and 62 healthy subjects and from adult mice exposed prenatally to
maternal immune activation or in adulthood to the immune stimulant poly(I:C).
RESULTS: Schizophrenia subjects had markedly higher mRNA levels for interleukin 6
(IL-6) (+379%) and interferon-ß (+29%), which induce IFITM expression; lower mRNA
levels for Schnurri-2 (-10%), a transcriptional inhibitor that lowers IFITM
expression; and higher mRNA levels for nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (+86%), a critical
transcription factor that mediates cytokine regulation of immune-related gene
expression. In adult mice that received daily poly(I:C) injections, but not in
offspring with prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation, frontal cortex
mRNA levels were also markedly elevated for IFITM (+304%), multiple cytokines
including IL-6 (+493%), and nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (+151%).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that higher prefrontal cortex IFITM mRNA levels
in schizophrenia may be attributable to adult, but not prenatal, activation of
multiple immune markers and encourage further investigation into the potential
role of these and other immune markers as therapeutic targets in schizophrenia.

To understand the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92
cells suggested from our previous study of in vivo anti-allergy and anti-virus
effects, host immune responses in macrophage-like THP-1 cells after 4 h (the
early phase) and 24 h (the late phase) of cocultivation with L-92 cells were
investigated by transcriptome analysis. In the early phase of L-92 treatment,
various transcription regulator genes, such as, NFkB1, NFkB2, JUN, HIVEP2 and
RELB, and genes encoding chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL4, CXCL11, CCL3 and
TNF, were upregulated. Two transmembrane receptor genes, TLR7 and ICAM1, were
also upregulated in the early phase of treatment. In contrast, many transmembrane
receptor genes, such as IL7R, CD80, CRLF2, CD86, CD5, HLA-DQA1, IL2RA, IL15RA and
CSF2RA, and some cytokine genes, including IL6, IL23A and CCL22, were
significantly upregulated in the late phase after L-92 exposure. Some genes
encoding cytokines, such as IL1A, IL1B and IL8, and the enzyme IDO1 were
upregulated at both the early and the late phases of treatment. These results
suggest that probiotic L-92 might promote Th1 and regulatory T-cell responses by 
activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, followed by the NOD-like receptor
signaling pathway in THP-1 cells.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein 3 (Hivep3)
suppresses osteoblast differentiation by inducing proteasomal degradation of the 
osteogenesis master regulator Runx2. In this study, we tested the possibility of 
cooperation of Hivep1, Hivep2, and Hivep3 in osteoblast and/or chondrocyte
differentiation. Microarray analyses with ST-2 bone stroma cells demonstrated
that expression of any known osteochondrogenesis-related genes was not commonly
affected by the three Hivep siRNAs. Only Hivep3 siRNA promoted osteoblast
differentiation in ST-2 cells, whereas all three siRNAs cooperatively suppressed 
differentiation in ATDC5 chondrocytes. We further used microarray analysis to
identify genes commonly down-regulated in both MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and ST-2
cells upon knockdown of Hivep3 and identified asparagine-linked glycosylation 2
(Alg2), which encodes a mannosyltransferase residing on the endoplasmic
reticulum. The Hivep3 siRNA-mediated promotion of osteoblast differentiation was 
negated by forced Alg2 expression. Alg2 suppressed osteoblast differentiation and
bone formation in cultured calvarial bone. Alg2 was immunoprecipitated with
Runx2, whereas the combined transfection of Runx2 and Alg2 interfered with Runx2 
nuclear localization, which resulted in suppression of Runx2 activity.
Chondrocyte differentiation was promoted by Hivep3 overexpression, in concert
with increased expression of Creb3l2, whose gene product is the endoplasmic
reticulum stress transducer crucial for chondrogenesis. Alg2 silencing suppressed
Creb3l2 expression and chondrogenesis of ATDC5 cells, whereas infection of
Alg2-expressing virus promoted chondrocyte maturation in cultured cartilage
rudiments. Thus, Alg2, as a downstream mediator of Hivep3, suppresses
osteogenesis, whereas it promotes chondrogenesis. To our knowledge, this study is
the first to link a mannosyltransferase gene to osteochondrogenesis.

The genetic basis for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) remains to be clarified.
Although 6q losses are commonly present, recurring gene losses in this region
remain to be defined. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 30 
WM patients, which included germline/tumor sequencing for 10 patients. Validated 
somatic mutations occurring in >10% of patients included MYD88, CXCR4, and ARID1A
that were present in 90%, 27%, and 17% of patients, respectively, and included
the activating mutation L265P in MYD88 and warts, hypogammaglobulinemia,
infection, and myelokathexis-syndrome-like mutations in CXCR4 that previously
have only been described in the germline. WGS also delineated copy number
alterations (CNAs) and structural variants in the 10 paired patients. The CXCR4
and CNA findings were validated in independent expansion cohorts of 147 and 30 WM
patients, respectively. Validated gene losses due to CNAs involved PRDM2 (93%),
BTG1 (87%), HIVEP2 (77%), MKLN1 (77%), PLEKHG1 (70%), LYN (60%), ARID1B (50%),
and FOXP1 (37%). Losses in PLEKHG1, HIVEP2, ARID1B, and BCLAF1 constituted the
most common deletions within chromosome 6. Although no recurrent translocations
were observed, in 2 patients deletions in 6q corresponded with translocation
events. These studies evidence highly recurring somatic events, and provide a
genomic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of WM.

Malignant gliomas are the most common and lethal intracranial tumors;
differentiation therapy is a promising candidate for their treatment. In order to
reveal the mechanisms related to glioma differentiation, after confirming that
differentiation was induced by sodium phenylbutyrate in SHG-44 human glioma
cells, RNA arbitrary primer differential display was used to screen
differentially expressed genes. One gene was found to be upregulated by
differential display, and this was also confirmed by reverse northern blot and
quantitative real-time PCR analysis. After it was cloned and sequenced, the
505-bp fragment was identified as the MIBP1 (c-myc intron-binding protein 1)
gene, also named Hivep2/MBP-2/Schnurri-2. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of 
30 human tissue samples revealed that the expression of MIBP1 tended to decrease 
with increasing WHO grade and was significantly depressed in the high malignancy 
gliomas group (WHO grade IV). We cloned and sequenced the MIBP1 gene, which was
accepted by GenBank as number DQ231041. Finally, transfection of MIBP1 in a
reverse transcription vector into glioma cells inhibited cell growth, induced
differentiation, and blocked the cell cycle. Here, we identify and describe the
structure and function of a differentiation-related gene, human MIBP1, in human
glioma.

Schnurri-2 (Shn-2), an nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B site-binding protein, tightly binds to
the enhancers of major histocompatibility complex class I genes and inflammatory 
cytokines, which have been shown to harbor common variant single-nucleotide
polymorphisms associated with schizophrenia. Although genes related to immunity
are implicated in schizophrenia, there has been no study showing that their
mutation or knockout (KO) results in schizophrenia. Here, we show that Shn-2 KO
mice have behavioral abnormalities that resemble those of schizophrenics. The
mutant brain demonstrated multiple schizophrenia-related phenotypes, including
transcriptome/proteome changes similar to those of postmortem schizophrenia
patients, decreased parvalbumin and GAD67 levels, increased theta power on
electroencephalograms, and a thinner cortex. Dentate gyrus granule cells failed
to mature in mutants, a previously proposed endophenotype of schizophrenia. Shn-2
KO mice also exhibited mild chronic inflammation of the brain, as evidenced by
increased inflammation markers (including GFAP and NADH/NADPH oxidase p22 phox), 
and genome-wide gene expression patterns similar to various inflammatory
conditions. Chronic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs reduced hippocampal
GFAP expression, and reversed deficits in working memory and nest-building
behaviors in Shn-2 KO mice. These results suggest that genetically induced
changes in immune system can be a predisposing factor in schizophrenia.

Dentin phosphophoryn (DPP) is a major noncollagenous protein in the dentin
matrix. In this study, we demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells such as
C3H10T1/2 and human bone marrow cells can be committed to the osteogenic lineage 
by DPP. Treatment with DPP can stimulate the release of intracellular Ca(2+).
This calcium flux triggered the activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII). Activated CaMKII induced the phosphorylation of Smad1 and
promoted nuclear translocation of p-Smad1. Inhibition of store Ca(2+) depletion
by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) or down-regulation of CaMKII by KN-62, a selective 
cell-permeable pharmacological inhibitor or a dominant negative plasmid of
CaMKII, blocked DPP-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation. Activation of Smad1 resulted 
in the expression of osteogenic markers such as Runx2, Osterix, DMP1, Bone
sialoprotein, Osteocalcin, NFATc1, and Schnurri-2, which have been implicated in 
osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that DPP is capable of
triggering commitment of pluripotent stem cells to the osteogenic lineage.

PURPOSE: Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial tumor, accounting
for 30% of all primary intracranial tumors. Although benign meningiomas rarely
recur after a complete resection, anaplastic tumors are associated with high
recurrence rate and unfavorable outcome. In the current study, we investigated
the expression of the multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5) in patients with
meningiomas.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied twenty patients with meningiomas that were
treated surgically in our institute over a 3-year period. MRP5 protein expression
was determined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: The immunohistochemical expression of MRP5 was observed only in
anaplastic meningiomas. No MRP5 expression was detected in benign or atypical
meningiomas. No significant correlation was found between MRP5 expression and
Ki-67 index. After a mean follow-up period of 23 months, there were 4 cases of
tumor recurrence. No correlation was found between extent of resection and tumor 
recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical MRP5 protein expression was observed only in
anaplastic meningiomas. Further research is needed to clarify whether MRP5 is
indicative of malignant pathological features in meningiomas and whether possible
therapeutic implications exist.

The transcription factor c-MYC intron binding protein 1 (MIBP1) binds to various 
genomic regulatory regions, including intron 1 of c-MYC. This factor is highly
expressed in postmitotic neurons in the fetal brain and may be involved in
various biological steps, such as neurological and immunological processes. In
this study, we globally characterized the transcriptional targets of MIBP1 and
proteins that interact with MIBP1. Microarray hybridization followed by gene set 
enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in the pathways downstream of
MYC, NF-<U+03BA>B, and TGF-ß were down-regulated when HEK293 cells stably overexpressed 
MIBP1. In silico transcription factor binding site analysis of the promoter
regions of these down-regulated genes showed that the NF-<U+03BA>B binding site was the 
most overrepresented. The up-regulation of genes known to be in the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway
after the knockdown of endogenous MIBP1 in HT1080 cells supports the view that
MIBP1 is a down-regulator of the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway. We also confirmed the binding of 
the MIBP1 to the NF-<U+03BA>B site. By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we
detected O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase as a prominent
binding partner of MIBP1. Analyses using deletion mutants revealed that a
154-amino acid region of MIBP1 was necessary for its O-GlcNAc transferase binding
and O-GlcNAcylation. A luciferase reporter assay showed that NF-<U+03BA>B-responsive
expression was repressed by MIBP1, and stronger repression by MIBP1 lacking the
154-amino acid region was observed. Our results indicate that the primary effect 
of MIBP1 expression is the down-regulation of the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway and that this
effect is attenuated by O-GlcNAc signaling.

The extent of resection in high grade glioma is increasingly been shown to
positively effect survival. Nevertheless, heterogeneity and migratory behavior of
glioma cells make gross total resection very challenging. Several techniques were
used in order to improve the detection of residual tumor. Aim of this study was
to analyze advantages and limitations of fluorescence and image guided resection.
A multicentric prospective study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of each
method. Furthermore, the role of 5-aminolevulinc acid and neuronavigation were
reviewed. Twenty-three patients harboring suspected high grade glioma, amenable
to complete resection, were enrolled. Fluorescence and image guides were used to 
perform surgery. Multiple samples were obtained from the resection cavity of each
lesion according to 5-ALA staining positivity and boundaries as delineated by
neuronavigation. All samples were analyzed by a pathologist blinded to the
intra-operative labeling. Decision-making based on fluorescence showed a
sensitivity of 91.1% and a specificity of 89.4% (p<0.001). On the other hand, the
image-guided resection accuracy was low (sensitivity: 57.8%; specificity: 57.4%; 
p=0.346). We observed that the sensitivity of 5-ALA can be improved by the
combined use of neuronavigation, but this leads to a significant reduction in
specificity. Thus, the use of auxiliary techniques should always be subject to
critical skills of the surgeon. We advocate a large-scale study to further
improve the assessment of multimodal approaches.

Schnurri (Shn)-2 is a large zinc finger-containing protein implicated in cell
growth, signal transduction and lymphocyte development. Here, we report that
Shn-2-deficient (Shn-2(-/-)) mice develop CD3-positive lymphoma spontaneously. In
Shn-2(-/-) mice, we observed decreased cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells 
accompanied by decreased expression of perforin and granzyme-B. In addition,
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 was 
reduced in Shn-2(-/-) NK cells, while phosphorylation of STAT3 and protein
expression of nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B p65 subunit were enhanced in Shn-2(-/-) NK cells.
Moreover, cell-surface expression of activation molecules such as CD27, CD69 and 
CD122 were decreased on Shn-2(-/-) NK cells. Thus, Shn-2 is considered to play an
important role in the activation and function of NK cells and the development of

Generation of a diverse and self-tolerant T-cell repertoire requires appropriate 
interpretation of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signals by CD4(+<U+2009>) CD8(+)
double-positive thymocytes. Thymocyte cell fate is dictated by the nature of
TCR-major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC)-peptide interactions, with signals of 
higher strength leading to death (negative selection) and signals of intermediate
strength leading to differentiation (positive selection). Molecules that regulate
T-cell development by modulating TCR signal strength have been described but
components that specifically define the boundaries between positive and negative 
selection remain unknown. Here we show in mice that repression of TCR-induced
death pathways is critical for proper interpretation of positive selecting
signals in vivo, and identify schnurri-2 (Shn2; also known as Hivep2) as a
crucial death dampener. Our results indicate that Shn2(-/-) double-positive
thymocytes inappropriately undergo negative selection in response to positive
selecting signals, thus leading to disrupted T-cell development. Shn2(-/-)
double-positive thymocytes are more sensitive to TCR-induced death in vitro and
die in response to positive selection interactions in vivo. However,
Shn2-deficient thymocytes can be positively selected when TCR-induced death is
genetically ablated. Shn2 levels increase after TCR stimulation, indicating that 
integration of multiple TCR-MHC-peptide interactions may fine-tune the death
threshold. Mechanistically, Shn2 functions downstream of TCR proximal signalling 
compenents to dampen Bax activation and the mitochondrial death pathway. Our
findings uncover a critical regulator of T-cell development that controls the
balance between death and differentiation.

Schnurri (Shn)-2 is a transcriptional modulator of bone formation and bone
resorption and its deficiency causes low turnover state with higher cancellous
bone mass due to the defects in osteoclasts that exceeds the defects in
osteoblasts in mice. We addressed whether such low turnover of bone remodeling in
Shn2 deficiency may be modulated in the absence of estrogen that induces high
turnover state in vivo. Ovariectomy reduced bone mass in wild type compared to
sham operated control mice and such reduction in bone mass was also observed in
Shn2 deficient mice. However, due to the high levels of basal bone mass in Shn2
deficient mice, the bone mass levels after ovariectomy were still comparable to
sham operated wild-type mice. Analysis indicated that estrogen depletion
increased bone resorption at similar levels in wild type and Shn2 deficient mice 
though the basal levels of osteoclast number was slightly lower in Shn2-deficient
mice. In contrast, basal levels of bone marrow cell mineralization in cultures
were low in Shn2-deficeint mice while estrogen depletion increased the
mineralization levels to those that were comparable to sham wild type. This
indicates that Shn2-deficient mice maintain bone mass at the levels comparable to
wild-type sham mice even after ovariectomy-induced bone loss and this correlates 
with the high levels of mineralization activity in bone marrow cells after
ovariectomy.

Memory Th1/Th2 cell generation controlled by Schnurri-2.

Japan. tnakayama@faculty.chiba-u.jp

Schnurri (Shn) is a large zinc-finger containingprotein, which plays a critical
role in cell growth, signal transduction and lymphocyte development. There are
three orthologues (Shn-1, Shn-2 and Shn-3) in vertebrates. In Shn-2-deficient
mice, the activation of NF-kappaB in CD4 T cells is upregulated and their ability
to differentiate into Th2 cells is enhanced in part through the increased
expression of GATA3. Shn-2 is found to compete with p50 NF-kappaB for binding to 
a consensus NF-kappaB motif and inhibit the NF-kappaB-driven promoter activity.
In addition, Th2-driven allergic airway inflammation was enhanced in
Shn-2-deficient mice. Therefore, Shn-2 appears to negatively control the
differentiation of Th2 cells and Th2 responses through the repression of
NF-kappaB function. Memory Th1/Th2 cells are not properly generated from
Shn-2-deficient effector Th1/Th2 cells. The expression levels of CD69 and the
number ofapoptotic cells are selectively increased in Shn-2-deficient Thl/Th2
cells when they are transferred into syngeneic host animals, in which memoryh
Th1/Th2 cells are generated within a month. In addition, an increased
susceptibility to apoptotic cell death is also observed in vitro accompanied with
the increased expression of FasL, one of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes. Th2
effector cells overexpressing the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB demonstrate a
decreased cell survival particularly in the lymph node. These results indicate
that Shn-2-mediated repression of NF-kappaB is required for cell survival and the
successful generation of memory Th1/Th2 cells. This may point to the possibility 
that after antigen clearance the recovery of the quiescent state in effector Th
cells is required for the generation of memory Th cells. A repressor molecule
Shn-2 plays an important role in this process.

MicroRNA miR-155 inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and
BMP-mediated Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

MicroRNA miR-155 is expressed at elevated levels in human cancers including
cancers of the lung, breast, colon, and a subset of lymphoid malignancies. In B
cells, miR-155 is induced by the oncogenic latency gene expression program of the
human herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Two other oncogenic herpesviruses,
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Marek's disease virus, encode
functional homologues of miR-155, suggesting a role for this microRNA in the
biology and pathogenesis of these viruses. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling is involved in an array of cellular processes, including
differentiation, growth inhibition, and senescence, through context-dependent
interactions with multiple signaling pathways. Alteration of this pathway
contributes to a number of disease states including cancer. Here, we show that
miR-155 targets the 3' untranslated region of multiple components of the BMP
signaling cascade, including SMAD1, SMAD5, HIVEP2, CEBPB, RUNX2, and MYO10.
Targeting of these mediators results in the inhibition of BMP2-, BMP6-, and
BMP7-induced ID3 expression as well as BMP-mediated EBV reactivation in the
EBV-positive B-cell line, Mutu I. Further, miR-155 inhibits SMAD1 and SMAD5
expression in the lung epithelial cell line A549, it inhibits BMP-mediated
induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and it reverses
BMP-mediated cell growth inhibition. These results suggest a role for miR-155 in 
controlling BMP-mediated cellular processes, in regulating BMP-induced EBV
reactivation, and in the inhibition of antitumor effects of BMP signaling in
normal and virus-infected cells.

Formation and remodeling of the skeleton relies on precise temporal and spatial
regulation of genes expressed in cartilage and bone cells. Debilitating diseases 
of the skeletal system occur when mutations arise that disrupt these intricate
genetic regulatory programs. Here, we report that mice bearing parallel null
mutations in the adapter proteins Schnurri2 (Shn2) and Schnurri3 (Shn3) exhibit
defects in patterning of the axial skeleton during embryogenesis. Postnatally,
these compound mutant mice develop a unique osteochondrodysplasia. The deletion
of Shn2 and Shn3 impairs growth plate maturation during endochondral ossification
but simultaneously results in massively elevated trabecular bone formation.
Hence, growth plate maturation and bone formation can be uncoupled under certain 
circumstances. These unexpected findings demonstrate that both unique and
redundant functions reside in the Schnurri protein family that are required for
proper skeletal patterning and remodeling.

TGF-beta signalling is regulated by Schnurri-2-dependent nuclear translocation of
CLIC4 and consequent stabilization of phospho-Smad2 and 3.

Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

CLIC4 (chloride intracellular channel 4), a multifunctional protein that traffics
between the cytoplasm and nucleus, interacts with Schnurri-2, a transcription
factor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway. Here we show
that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) promotes the expression of CLIC4 
and Schnurri-2 as well as their association in the cytoplasm and their
translocation to the nucleus. In the absence of CLIC4 or Schnurri-2, TGF-beta
signalling is abrogated. Direct nuclear targeting of CLIC4 enhances TGF-beta
signalling and removes the requirement for Schnurri-2. Nuclear CLIC4 associates
with phospho (p)-Smad2 and p-Smad3, protecting them from dephosphorylation by
nuclear phosphatases. An intact TGF-beta signalling pathway is essential for
CLIC4-mediated growth-arrest. These results newly identify Schnurri-2 and CLIC4
as modifiers of TGF-beta signalling through their stabilization of p-Smad2 and 3 
in the nucleus.

MicroRNA-155 is an Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene that modulates Epstein-Barr
virus-regulated gene expression pathways.

The cellular microRNA miR-155 has been shown to be involved in lymphocyte
activation and is expressed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells displaying
type III latency gene expression but not type I latency gene expression. We show 
here that the elevated levels of miR-155 in type III latency cells is due to EBV 
gene expression and not epigenetic differences in cell lines tested, and we show 
that expression in EBV-infected cells requires a conserved AP-1 element in the
miR-155 promoter. Gene expression analysis was carried out in a type I latency
cell line transduced with an miR-155-expressing retrovirus. This analysis
identified both miR-155-suppressed and -induced cellular mRNAs and suggested that
in addition to direct targeting of 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), miR-155 alters
gene expression in part through the alteration of signal transduction pathways.
3' UTR reporter analysis of predicted miR-155 target genes identified the
transcriptional regulatory genes encoding BACH1, ZIC3, HIVEP2, CEBPB, ZNF652,
ARID2, and SMAD5 as miR-155 targets. Western blot analysis of the most highly
suppressed of these, BACH1, showed lower expression in cells transduced with a
miR-155 retrovirus. Inspection of the promoters from genes regulated in
EBV-infected cells and in cells infected with an miR-155 retrovirus identified
potential binding sequences for BACH1 and ZIC3. Together, these experiments
suggest that the induction of miR-155 by EBV contributes to EBV-mediated
signaling in part through the modulation of transcriptional regulatory factors.

To clarify the role of p27/Kip1 (p27) in primary central nervous system lymphomas
(PCNSLs), we examined p27 expression by immunohistochemical methods in a series
of 22 patients with PCNSL. We attempted to correlate the expression of p27 with
proliferation potential and prognosis. Although the MIB-1 labeling index (LI) was
lower in tumors with low p27 expression (26.7% +/- 17.2% vs 38.1% +/- 16.3%), it 
was not significantly different from that of tumors with high p27 expression (P =
0.1253). Survival analysis revealed that high p27 expression was significantly
associated with poorer overall prognosis (P = 0.0011); however, the MIB-1 LI were
not associated with prognosis. Our results suggest p27 as a predictor of
prognosis in patients with PCNSL.

We investigated the feasibility of using radiologic characteristics to predict
the proliferative potential in meningiomas. Our statistical analysis revealed
that the presence of peritumoral edema, an ambiguous brain-tumor border, and
irregular tumor shape were significantly correlated with a higher MIB-1 staining 
index (SI) value. We developed the following scoring system for specific features
in each tumor: peritumoral edema (tumor with edema = 1, tumor without edema = 0);
brain-tumor border (tumor with any ambiguous border = 1, tumor circumscribed by a
distinct rim = 0); and tumor shape (tumor with irregular shape = 1, tumor with
smooth shape = 0). Using Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis, we found a 
significant correlation (P < 0.005) between total score calculated for each
patient and SI value. Our findings suggest that the proliferative potential of
meningiomas can be predicted using a less invasive preoperative examination
focusing on the presence of peritumoral edema, ambiguous brain-tumor border, and 
irregular tumor shape.

hyperresponsiveness.

Schnurri (Shn)-2 is a large zinc finger-containing protein, which plays a
critical role in cell growth, signal transduction and lymphocyte development. In 
Shn-2-deficient (Shn-2(-/-)) CD4 T cells, the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB
is up-regulated and their ability to differentiate into Th2 is enhanced. Here, we
extend our investigation and demonstrate that Shn-2 regulates Th2 responses in
vivo using an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma model. Eosinophilic inflammation,
mucus hyperproduction and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were all enhanced in
Shn-2(-/-) mice. Moreover, eosinophilic infiltration and AHR were enhanced in
mice given a transfer of Shn-2(-/-) effector Th2. Shn-2 in Th2 is thus considered
to play an important role as a negative regulator in allergic airway
inflammation.

Schnurri-2 (Shn-2) is a large zinc-finger containing protein, and it plays a
critical role in cell growth, signal transduction and lymphocyte development. In 
Shn-2-deficient CD4 T cells, the activation of NF-kappaB was up-regulated and
their ability to differentiate into Th2 cells was enhanced. We herein demonstrate
that Th1 and Th2 memory cells are not properly generated from Shn-2-deficient
effector Th1/Th2 cells. Even a week after the transfer of effector Th1/Th2 cells 
into syngeneic mice, a dramatic decrease in the number of Shn-2-deficient donor T
cells was detected particularly in the lymphoid organs. The transferred
Shn-2-deficient Th1/Th2 cells express higher levels of the activation marker
CD69. No significant defect in the BrdU incorporation in the Shn-2-deficient
transferred CD4 T cells was observed. The numbers of apoptotic cells were
selectively higher in Shn-2-deficient donor Th1/Th2 cell population. Moreover,
Shn-2-deficient effector Th1 and Th2 cells showed an increased susceptibility to 
cell death in in vitro cultures with increased expression of FasL. Transfer of
Th2 effector cells over-expressing the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB resulted in a
decreased number of p65-expressing cells in the lymphoid organs. As expected, T
cell-dependent Ab responses after in vivo immunization of Shn-2-deficient mice
were significantly reduced. Thus, Shn-2 appears to control the generation of
memory Th1/Th2 cells through a change in their susceptibility to cell death.

Regulation of bone remodeling determines the levels of bone mass and its
imbalance causes major skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. A zinc finger
protein, Schnurri-2 (SHN-2), was recently demonstrated to regulate bone
morphogenetic protein-dependent adipogenesis and lymphogenesis. However, the role
of SHN-2 in bone is not known. Here, we investigated the effects of Shn-2
deficiency on bone metabolism and cell function in Shn-2-null mice. Lack of SHN-2
expression reduced bone remodeling by suppressing both osteoblastic bone
formation and osteoclastic bone resorption activities in vivo. Shn-2 deficiency
suppressed osterix and osteocalcin expression as well as in vitro mineralization.
Conversely, Shn-2 overexpression enhanced osteocalcin promoter activity and bone 
morphogenetic protein-dependent osteoblastic differentiation. Shn-2 deficiency
suppressed Nfatc1 and c-fos expression leading to reduction of tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase-positive cell development in vivo as well as in the cultures of 
bone marrow cells. These studies demonstrate that SHN-2 regulates the activities 
of critical transcription factors required for normal bone remodeling.

Activation of the c-myc p1 promoter in Burkitt's lymphoma by the hs3
immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Molecular Biology in Medicine, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health
Care System, Stanford, CA, USA.

The expression of c-myc is deregulated in Burkitt's lymphoma by the translocation
t(8;14). Most of the increased c-myc expression is from the P1 promoter, which is
normally a minor promoter. How the P1 promoter is activated by the immunoglobulin
heavy chain gene enhancers is not understood. We identified a YY1 site in the
immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene HS3 enhancer, which increased c-myc P1 promoter
activity, and a MARE site, which decreased c-myc P1 activity. Small Maf proteins 
bound to the MARE site both in vitro and in vivo, recruited histone deacetylase
2, and resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the c-myc promoter
region. In contrast, YY1 recruited CBP and increased histone acetylation at the
c-myc promoter. Rb interacts with YY1 to prevent DNA binding in normal B cells,
but no significant interaction with YY1 was detected in Burkitt's cells, and
binding of YY1 to the HS3 enhancer was observed by chromatin immunoprecipitaton. 
Increased expression of MafK and/or decreased expression of YY1 by silencing RNA 
downregulated endogenous c-myc mRNA levels and increased the sensitivity of the
cells to doxorubicin. Mutation of the major active sites (nuclear factor-kappa B 
and YY1) in the enhancers prevented c-myc activation.

The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-beta)/activin superfamily regulates development of the nervous system during
embryogenesis and is also suggested to be involved in adult brain function.
However, how BMP/TGF-beta/activin signals modulate neuronal function remains
unknown. Schnurri is a transcription factor that contains two metal finger
regions. Mammalian Shn-2 enters the nucleus from the cytoplasm in response to
BMP-2 stimulation and plays an important role in BMP-dependent adipogenesis. To
investigate whether mammalian Shn plays a role in adult brain function, we
examined the behaviors of mutant mice lacking Shn-2 (Shn-2(-/-)). Shn-2(-/-) mice
exhibited hypersensitivity to stress accompanied by anxiety-like behavior.
Consistent with this, stress-induced corticosterone levels were significantly
higher in Shn-2(-/-) mice compared to wild-type controls. Interestingly,
Shn-2(-/-) mice were more active than wild-type mice in a familiar environment.
The basal and stress-induced expression levels of the immediate early genes,
including c-Fos, were decreased in Shn-2(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.
Thus, Shn-2 plays a critical role in locomotion and anxiety-like behavior.

Adipocyte differentiation is an important component of obesity, but how hormonal 
cues mediate adipocyte differentiation remains elusive. BMP stimulates in vitro
adipocyte differentiation, but the role of BMP in adipogenesis in vivo is
unknown. Drosophila Schnurri (Shn) is required for the signaling of
Decapentaplegic, a Drosophila BMP homolog, via interaction with the Mad/Medea
transcription factors. Vertebrates have three Shn orthologs, Shn-1, -2, and -3.
Here, we report that Shn-2(-/-) mice have reduced white adipose tissue and that
Shn-2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts cannot efficiently differentiate into
adipocytes in vitro. Shn-2 enters the nucleus upon BMP-2 stimulation and, in
cooperation with Smad1/4 and C/EBPalpha, induces the expression of PPARgamma2, a 
key transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation. Shn-2 directly interacts 
with both Smad1/4 and C/EBPalpha on the PPARgamma2 promoter. These results
indicate that Shn-2-mediated BMP signaling has a critical role in adipogenesis.

The HIVEP2 gene, located on 6q23-q24, belongs to a family of genes that encodes
large zinc fingers containing transcription factor proteins. Although this gene
has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses and cellular
proliferation, its functions are largely unknown. In the present study, we
investigated HIVEP2 gene abnormalities in microdissected breast cancer tissue.
For real-time quantitational RT-PCR analysis of paired normal and tumor tissues, 
mRNA levels were down-regulated to a maximum of 96%. The overall median
expression level in breast cancer (33 cases) was significantly lower than that in
normal breast tissue (normalized median value of 4.49 versus 17.68; p < 0.0001). 
Through full-length 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) analysis, we
identified multiple exons in the 5'-untranslated regions with multiple
transcriptional start sites, four of which were located in a large CpG island. No
tissue- or cancer-specific usage patterns for the transcription start sites were 
identified by multiplex RT-PCR analysis. Only faint methylation was detected in
the 5' region of the island in normal cells and breast cancer tissue, indicating 
physiological, aging and no tumor-specific methylation. Mutation screening showed
only germline polymorphisms. Thus, down-regulation of the HIVEP2 genes frequently
occurs and may be one of the genetic events responsible for breast cancer, and
their transcription may be regulated by complex mechanisms involving interactions
with other factors and/or by other genetic/epigenetic mechanisms.

Schnurri (Shn) is a large zinc finger protein implicated in cell growth, signal
transduction, and lymphocyte development. Vertebrates possess at least three Shn 
orthologues (Shn-1, Shn-2, and Shn-3), which appear to act within the bone
morphogenetic protein, transforming growth factor beta, and activin signaling
pathways. However, the physiological functions of the Shn proteins remain largely
unknown. In Shn-2-deficient mice, mature peripheral T cells exhibited normal
anti-T cell receptor-induced proliferation, although there was dramatic
enhancement in the differentiation into T helper type (Th)2 cells and a marginal 
effect on Th1 cell differentiation. Shn-2-deficient developing Th2 cells showed
constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and enhanced GATA3
induction. Shn-2 was able to compete with p50 NF-kappaB for binding to a
consensus NF-kappaB motif and inhibit NF-kappaB-driven promoter activity. Thus,
Shn-2 plays a crucial role in the control of Th2 cell differentiation by

Cyclin D1, p53, MIB1, intratumoral microvessel density, and human papillomavirus 
in advanced laryngeal carcinoma: association with nodal metastasis.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to study various parameters in laryngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (LSCC) that might predict nodal metastasis.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Sixty-four LSCCs were examined with respect to their
histopathology and, using immunohistochemistry, their proliferative capacity
(MIB1), p53 and cyclin D1 status, and intratumoral microvessel density. The
presence of human papillomavirus was ascertained by the polymerase chain
reaction.
RESULTS: Histopathologically, most tumors had an infiltrating/mixed growth
pattern and a diminished inflammatory reaction at the growing margin. In
addition, 56% of the tumors were positive for MIB1, with 64% showing p53
overexpression; 70% were positive for cyclin D1; and 59% showed increased tumor
microvessel density. Of 42 cases analyzed, 9.5% were positive for human
papillomavirus 16.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the parameters studied, a diminished lymphocytic inflammatory
response at the periphery (P < 0.05) and cyclin D1 overexpression (P < 0.001)
correlated significantly with cervical nodal metastasis at presentation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Cyclin D1 overexpression, easily assessed on biopsy samples, may
thus help in optimizing therapy at the outset.

(1)Abteilung Entwicklungsbiochemie, Universität Göttingen, Germany.

The HIVEP gene family encodes for very large sequence-specific DNA binding
proteins containing multiple zinc fingers. Three mammalian paralogous genes have 
been identified, HIVEP1, -2 and -3, as well as the closely related Drosophila
gene, Schnurri. These genes have been found to directly participate in the
transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes. Mammalian HIVEP members have
been implicated in signaling by TNF-alpha and in the positive selection of
thymocytes, while Schnurri has been shown to be an essential component of the
TGF-beta signaling pathway. In this study, we describe the isolation of Xenopus
HIVEP1, as well as partial cDNAs of HIVEP2 and -3. Analysis of the temporal and
spatial expression of the XHIVEP transcripts during early embryogenesis revealed 
ubiquitous expression of the transcripts. Assays using Xenopus oocytes mapped
XHIVEP1 domains that are responsible for nuclear export and import activity. The 
DNA binding specificity of XHIVEP was characterized using a PCR-mediated
selection and gel mobility shift assays.

Regionally restricted expression of the transcription factor c-myc intron 1
binding protein during brain development.

Campbell DB(1), Levitt P.

Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.

Transcription factors regulate proliferation, differentiation, and
regionalization of the central nervous system. In a screen of developing cerebral
cortex, we identified the transcription factor c-myc intron 1 binding protein
(mibp1) due to its abundant expression. In this study, we analyzed the temporal
and spatial expression patterns of mibp1 mRNA in developing mouse brain to
address the putative role of this transcription factor in neural differentiation.
Northern hybridization studies revealed that mibp1 is expressed first in the
mouse dorsal telencephalon at embryonic day (E) 14.5, during peak neuronal
production. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that mibp1 expression in
the cerebral wall is most abundant in postmitotic cells of the cortical plate and
absent from proliferative zones. Moreover, mibp1 is restricted to dorsal
telencephalon during embryogenesis with expression only in the cerebral wall,
olfactory bulb, and hippocampus. N-myc, a potential target of mibp1 regulation,
exhibited complementary, nonoverlapping expression patterns in the telencephalon 
with greatest expression in proliferating cells of the ventricular zone from
E12.5 to E14.5; N-myc was absent from the telencephalon by E15.5. The specificity
and timing of mibp1 expression in the cerebral cortex suggests a role in
maintaining a state of neuronal differentiation in the dorsal telencephalon.

Inhibition of monocyte/endothelial cell interactions and monocyte adhesion
molecule expression by the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil.

Glomsda BA(1), Blaheta RA, Hailer NP.

Author information: 
(1)University Hospital for Orthopaedic Surgery Friedrichsheim, Frankfurt am Main,
Germany.

STUDY DESIGN: In vitro study on the effects of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on
isolated human monocytes and endothelial cells.
OBJECTIVES: Haematogenous macrophages play an essential role in the development
of secondary damage following spinal cord injury (SCI), and there is evidence
that the use of immunosuppressants such as MMF can reduce monocyte invasion and
neuronal damage.
SETTING: University Hospital for Orthopaedic Surgery, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
METHODS: The effects of MMF on the adhesion of human monocytes to human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), monocyte binding to immobilised E-selectin, and
monocyte expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, sialyl Lewis X
(sLeX) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II were studied. The binding of
monocytes to E-selectin was examined by using purified and immobilised E-selectin
fusion protein. Adhesion molecule expression was investigated by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The binding of monocytes to HUVEC was significantly reduced by 30.1%
after treatment of monocytes with MMF (10 microg/ml), whereas the pretreatment of
HUVEC with MMF did not result in significant changes in monocyte adhesion. MMF
forcefully inhibited monocyte binding to immobilised E-selectin by 55.7%.
Furthermore, MMF significantly inhibited the upregulation of ICAM-1- and
MHC-II-expression on monocytes stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide or
interferon-gamma, whereas the expression of sLeX was not impaired. Toxic effects 
were excluded by propidium-iodide staining and measurement of
fluorescein-diacetate metabolism.
CONCLUSION: MMF can downregulate important monocytic adhesion molecules and
inhibits monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, thus indicating that treatment
with MMF could be beneficial after SCI.

ZAS: C2H2 zinc finger proteins involved in growth and development.

Wu LC(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, 
College of Medicine and Public Health, Columbus 43210, USA. wu.39@osu.edu

A ZAS gene encodes a large protein with two separate C2H2 zinc finger pairs that 
independently bind to specific DNA sequences, including the kappaB motif. Three
paralogous mammalian genes, ZAS1, ZAS2, and ZAS3, and a related Drosophila gene, 
Schnurri, have been cloned and characterized. The ZAS genes encode
transcriptional proteins that activate or repress the transcription of a variety 
of genes involved in growth, development, and metastasis. In addition, ZAS3
associates with a TNF receptor-associated factor to inhibit NF-kappaB- and JNK/
SAPK-mediated signaling of TNF-alpha. Genetic experiments show that ZAS3
deficiency leads to proliferation of cells and tumor formation in mice. The data 
suggest that ZAS3 is important in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and
inflammation. The potent vasoactive hormone endothelin and transcription factor
AP2 gene families also each consist of three members. The ZAS, endothelin, and
transcription factor AP2 genes form several linkage groups. Knowledge of the
chromosomal locations of these genes provides valuable clues to the evolution of 
the vertebrate genome.

Characterization of the biological functions of a transcription factor, c-myc
intron binding protein 1 (MIBP1).

Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.

The c-myc intron binding protein 1 (MIBP1) is a gigantic zinc finger protein
comprising 2,437 amino acids and belonging to the MHC binding protein (MBP)
family. MIBP1 is suggested to be a transcription factor involved in various
biological functions. We show here that MIBP1 represses c-myc transcription from 
the major promoter, P2. Screening by the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that
the MIBP1 protein interacts with the Ski-interacting protein (SKIP). In vitro
pull-down assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this
interaction. The acidic region of MIBP1 was found to be the site of interaction
with the N-terminal half of SKIP. In situ hybridization analysis using developing
rat embryos revealed that the MIBP1 mRNA is highly expressed in post-mitotic
neurons, but the expression in immature neuroepithelium is low. The expression of
MIBP1 in adult rat brain is also predominantly in neuronal cells, indicating that
MIBP1 is involved in the physiology of mature neuronal cells.

Neurones and microglia in central nervous system immune response to degenerative

disease. Quantitative study.

The quantitative correlation between neurone loss and brain immune response,
assessed by intensity of microglia inflammatory reaction in cortical association 
area and limbic cortex, was investigated and compared in previously
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ultrastructural confirmed 11 cases of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), 7 cases mixed form of Dementia with AD findings and Lewy bodies
(AD/DLB) reported, in accordance with Consortium on Dementia, as Lewy body
variant of AD (LBV) and 6 non-demented autopsy control cases from 63 to 86 years 
old. In the present work we investigated association and limbic cortical areas
linked with memory mechanisms; there are regions characterised by early
distribution of IHC confirmed AD and DLB/AD (LBV) markers, as well as a
substantial physiological stability of neurone pool regardless of age. The
results indicated that AD and LBV differ in their neurone loss intensity and
inflammatory reaction, with much higher intensity in AD. In Alzheimer's disease, 
neurone loss in association temporal cortex made up 51% of control values with
simultaneous 8-fold increase in the density of MHC II-positive activated
microglia, whereas in LBV, both the loss of neurone density and the increase in
activated microglia density, was not so high (up to 41% and 4-5-fold,
respectively). Changes in the limbic cortex were less pronounced. A strong
correlation in the clinical material between neurone loss and microglia
activation in both processes, especially in AD (r = 0.73), speaks in favour of
the hypothesis on the neuronal immune surveillance and arousal of immune brain
response in conditions of declining control, due to significant neurone loss in
the neurodegenerative process. The inflammatory reaction of MHC II-immunoreactive
microglia, concomitant with neurodegenerative process, seems to be a consequence 
of increased immune response due to loss of neurones and weakening of their
control upon immunosurveillance in central nervous system.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with regard to its 
clinical course. The limitations of the methods currently available for
prognostic assessment in CLL do not allow accurate prediction of the risk of
disease progression in individual patients. The recently developed cDNA array
technique provides a unique opportunity to study gene expression in various
malignancies. To identify new molecular markers for prognostication of CLL
patients, we analyzed cDNA arrays by using hierarchical clustering and standard
statistic t-test on 34 CLL patients. We found significant expression differences 
in 78 genes compared to the reference tonsillar B lymphocytes. A cluster of
genes, LCP1, PARP, BLR1, DEK, NPM, MCL1, SLP76, STAM, HIVEP1, EVI2B, CD25, HTLF, 
HIVEP2, BCL2, MNDA, PBX3, EB12, TCF1, CGRP, CD14, ILB, GZMK, GPR17 and CD79B, was
associated (P < 0.05) with the unfavorable 11q deletion and also with the
unfavorable Binet stages B and C. We present here gene expression profiling that 
is associated with CLL patients with the 11q23 deletion. Many of the genes in the
cluster have not previously been shown to be related to the initiation or
progression of CLL. These novel findings provide fundamental information for
further attempts to understand the interaction of the clustered genes in the
leukomogenesis of CLL in order to better design treatments aimed at specific
molecular target(s).

A key step in T cell development involves the positive selection of cells that
recognize antigen presented by self-major histocompatibility complex. Yet, the
signals that are activated by T cell receptor engagement and lead to cell
survival remain unclear. We show here that mice lacking the transcription factor 
Schnurri-2 (Shn-2), a large metal-finger protein, had severely defective positive
selection of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Drosophila Shn acts as a cofactor of Smad
homolog and is required for Decapentaplegic signaling. Vertebrates have at least 
three Shn orthologs (Shn-1, Shn-2 and Shn-3), which are thought to act as nuclear
targets in the bone morphogenetic protein-transforming growth factor-beta-activin
signaling pathways. These data raised the possibility that the Smad-Shn-2 complex
is involved in the thymic selection of T cells.

Several members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily
have been demonstrated to play regulatory roles in osteoblast differentiation and
maturation, but the mechanisms by which they act on different cells at different 
developmental stages remain largely unknown. We studied the effects of TGF-beta1 
and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) on the differentiation/maturation of
osteoblasts using the murine cell lines MC3T3-E1 and C3H10T1/2. BMP-2 induced or 
enhanced the expression of the osteoblast differentiation markers alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) in both cells. In contrast, TGF-beta1 was 
not only unable to induce these markers, but it dramatically inhibited
BMP-2-mediated OC gene expression and ALP activity. In addition, TGF-beta1
inhibited the ability of BMP-2 to induce MC3T3-E1 mineralization. TGF-beta1 did
not sensibly modify the increase of Osf2/Cbfa1 gene expression mediated by BMP-2,
thus demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on osteoblast
differentiation/maturation mediated by BMP-2 was independent of Osf2/Cbfa1 gene
expression. Finally, it is shown that TGF-beta1 does not affect BMP-2-induced
Smad1 transcriptional activity in the mesenchymal pluripotent cells studied
herein. Our data indicate that in vitro BMP-2 and TGF-beta1 exert opposite
effects on osteoblast differentiation and maturation.

Promiscuity of pre-mRNA spliceosome-mediated trans splicing: a problem for gene
therapy?

Kikumori T(1), Cote GJ, Gagel RF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, Division of Internal
Medicine, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030,
USA.

Trans splicing of messenger RNA has been used in experimental settings to replace
mutant RNA sequences. We investigated the feasibility of utilizing trans splicing
to replace a mutant RET protooncogene sequence known to inappropriately activate 
this tyrosine kinase receptor. We constructed a pre-trans-splicing molecule (PTM)
consisting of a binding domain complementary to the target intron, the 3'
splicing signal sequence (3'ss), derived from adenovirus major late transcript
intron 1 and a molecular tag sequence. Accurately targeted trans splicing between
the human RET exons and the PTM was demonstrated in NIH 3T3 cells cotransfected
with the human RET minigene and the PTM. The efficiency of specific trans
splicing was estimated to be no more than 15% in the cotransfection experiment.
However, in addition to the targeted trans splicing, nontargeted trans splicing
to RET exons was observed. Furthermore, the rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends
(5' RACE) analysis demonstrated that nontargeted trans splicing occurred with
endogenously expressed pre-mRNAs in TT cells and that specific trans splicing to 
RET was a rare event. Attempts to reduce nonspecificity by the addition of a
stem-loop to the trans-splicing construct designed to suppress nonspecific
splicing failed to have the desired effect. These observations suggest that
overexpression of a trans-splicing construct containing a 3'ss results in
promiscuous trans splicing and raise significant questions about the specificity 
and usefulness of currently used trans-splicing approaches. In addition, these
findings raise the possibility that nonspecific spliced products may be produced 
by a variety of gene therapy constructs.

MIB1 proliferation index in breast infiltrating carcinoma: comparison with other 
proliferative markers and association with new biological prognostic factors.

González-Vela MC(1), Garijo MF, Fernández F, Val-Bernal JF.

Author information: 
(1)Anatomical Pathology Department, Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital,
Medical Faculty, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain.

AIMS: In breast invasive carcinoma our objectives were I) to compare cellular
proliferation determined by MIB1 index with S-phase fraction (SPF) assessed by
flow cytometry and with mitotic index, and II) to examine the association of MIB1
index with classical and with new biological prognostic factors [bcl-2, p53,
c-erbB-2 and cathepsin D (CD)].
METHODS AND RESULTS: From 102 cases of breast invasive carcinoma, 5-microm thick 
serial sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks,
and processed for detection of CD, c-erbB-2, p53, bcl-2, Ki-67 antigen MIB-1 and 
estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR). SPF was measured by flow
cytometry in fresh-frozen tissue samples taken from the carcinoma in each
patient. MIB1 index was correlated with SPF (rho=0.45, p<0.0001) and with mitotic
index (rho=0.42, p<0.0001). The MIB-1 index was positively associated with the
histological grade (p=0.001), tumor size (p=0.04) and the presence of metastases 
in axillary lymph nodes (p=0.01). MIB1 was associated directly with p53 (p=0.045)
and inversely with bcl-2 (p=0.0002). The MIB-1 index was not statistically
associated with c-erbB-2. There was a weak association between MIBI index and
stromal cell CD. The median MIB1 index was higher in tumors with moderate to
strong CD staining of stromal cell, but the difference did not reach statistical 
significance (p=0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: MIB1 index correlates with well established methods for assessing
tumor proliferation and with parameters of an aggressive phenotype of tumor. MIB1
index is an effective and readily accessible method for assessing tumor
proliferation in breast carcinoma.

Structure of the human zinc finger protein HIVEP3: molecular cloning, expression,
exon-intron structure, and comparison with paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2.

Hicar MD(1), Liu Y, Allen CE, Wu LC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, College of
Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of HIVEP3, the newest member in
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein family that
encodes large zinc finger proteins and regulates transcription via the kappaB
enhancer motif. The largest open reading frame of HIVEP3 contains 2406 aa. and is
approximately 80% identical to the mouse counterpart. The HIVEP3 gene is located 
in the chromosomal region 1p34 and is at least 300 kb with 10 exons. RNA studies 
show that multiple HIVEP3 transcripts are differentially expressed and regulated.
Additionally, transcription termination occurs in the ultimate exon, exon 10, or 
in exon 6. Therefore, HIVEP3 may produce protein isoforms that contain or exclude
the carboxyl DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper by alternative RNA
splicing and differential polyadenylation. Sequence homologous to HIVEP3 exon 6
is not found in mouse nor are the paralogous genes HIVEP1 and HIVEP2. Zoo-blot
analysis suggests that sequences homologous to the human exon 6 are present only 
in primates and cow. Therefore, a foreign DNA harboring a termination exon likely
was inserted into the HIVEP3 locus relatively recently in evolution, resulting in
the acquisition of novel gene regulatory mechanisms as well as the generation of 
structural and functional diversity.

Clonal patterns in phaeochromocytomas and MEN-2A adrenal medullary hyperplasias: 
histological and kinetic correlates.

The relationship among histological features, cell kinetics, and clonality has
not been studied in adrenal medullary hyperplasias (AMHs) and phaeochromocytomas 
(PCCs). Thirty-four PCCs (23 sporadic and 11 MEN-2A (multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 2A)-related tumours, the latter associated with AMH) from females were
included in this study. Representative samples were histologically evaluated and 
microdissected to extract DNA and evaluate the methylation pattern of the
androgen receptor alleles. At least two tissue samples (from the peripheral and
internal zones in each tumour) were analysed with appropriate tissue controls run
in every case. The same areas were selected for MIB-1 staining and in situ end
labelling (ISEL). Malignant PCCs were defined by histologically confirmed distant
metastases. All monoclonal AMH nodules from the same patient showed the same
X-chromosome inactivated. Six sporadic PCCs revealed liver metastases (malignant 
PCC) and eight additional sporadic PCCs showed periadrenal infiltration (locally 
invasive PCC). All informative PCCs were monoclonal, except for five locally
invasive PCCs and one benign PCC that revealed polyclonal patterns. Those cases
also showed a fibroblastic stromal reaction with prominent blood vessels, focal
smooth muscle differentiation, and significantly higher MIB-1 (126.8+/-29.9) and 
ISEL (50.9+/-12.8) indices. Concordant X-chromosome inactivation in nodules from 
a given patient suggests that MEN-2A AMH is a multifocal monoclonal condition. A 
subgroup of PCCs characterized by balanced methylation of androgen receptor
alleles, high cellular turnover, and stromal proliferation also shows locally
invasive features.

The diagnosis and evaluation of neoplasms of the central nervous system
frequently involves the use of immunohistochemical stains. This article reviews
some of the more commonly used markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein,
synaptophysin, neurofilament protein, S-100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen,
and cytokeratin markers. The focus of the discussion is on the use of these
markers including their utility in resolving differential diagnostic issues. We
also review the use of p53 and a variety of cell proliferation markers including 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67, MIB-1 and their potential role as
adjuncts in the grading of tumors and their potential role in predicting tumor
behavior.

Multiprotein complexes present at the MIF motifs flanking the promoter of the

Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Navy Oncology Branch, Building 8, R

The activated c-myc allele in Burkitt's lymphoma is associated with a clustering 
of somatic mutations within a discrete domain of intron I that define protein
recognition sequences, designated as myc intron factors (MIF-1, MIF-2 and MIF-3).
We have previously shown that MIF-1 binding activity consists of two
polypeptides, myc intron binding polypeptide (MIBP1) and RFX1. In the present
study we identified two polypeptides, p105 and p115, and showed that these
proteins give rise to a DNA-protein complex at the MIF-2 as well as the adjacent 
MIF-1 site. In addition, we demonstrated that all four proteins interact with a
novel MIF-1 like motif upstream from the c-myc promoter region, designated 5'MIF.
These data suggest a model, where the interactions of MIBP1/RFX1 and p105/p115
with the MIF-like sites may play a role in the promoter topology of the c-myc
gene.

Retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of HL60 cells is associated with an
alteration of chromatin structure that maps to protein-binding sequences within
intron I of the c-myc gene and with down-regulation of c-myc expression. By using
HeLa cell extracts, we previously identified two polypeptides, designated MIBP1
(for Myc-intron-binding peptide) and RFX1, that interact in vivo and bind to the 
intron I element; we showed that tandem repeats of an MIBP1/RFX1-binding site can
exhibit silencer activity on a heterologous promoter. Here we demonstrate that
p160 MIBP1 and p130 RFX1 are absent from undifferentiated HL60 cells. In
addition, we show that treatment with retinoic acid induces both MIBP1 and RFX1
protein, as well as their DNA-binding activity, upon granulocytic differentiation
of HL60 cells, with a gel mobility pattern identical to that of HeLa cells. In
the absence of p160 MIBP1 and p130 RFX1, we observed that the altered gel
mobility-shift pattern detected in undifferentiated HL60 cells reflects the
binding of two novel polypeptides, p30 and p97, that can be cross-linked to the
same recognition intron sequence. We also show that the time course of MIBP1 and 
RFX1 induction is inversely correlated with the down-regulation of c-myc levels
during the treatment of HL60 cells with retinoic acid.

Most vertebrate mRNAs exit the nucleus with a 200+-residue poly(A) tail and are
deadenylated to yield heterogeneous polymers of 50-200 adenosine residues on any 
given mRNA. We previously reported that Xenopus albumin mRNA and pre-mRNA have an
unusually short, discrete 17-residue poly(A) tail and showed that regulation of
poly(A) length is controlled independently by two cis-acting poly(A)-limiting
elements (PLE A and PLE B) located in the terminal exon. The present study sought
to determine the generality of this regulatory mechanism. Transferrin mRNA also
has a discrete <20-nt poly(A) tail, and deletion mapping experiments identified
an element homologous to the albumin gene PLE B within the terminal exon of the
transferrin gene that conferred poly(A) length regulation on a globin reporter
mRNA. Based on this similarity the PLE B sequence was used in a database search
to identify candidate mRNA targets for regulated polyadenylation. Of the several 
hundred sequences identified in this manner we focused on HIV-EP2/Schnurri-2, a
member of a family of genes encoding related zinc finger transcription factors. A
striking feature of the PLE-like element in these genes is its location 10-33 bp 
upstream of the translation stop codon. We demonstrate that HIV-EP2 mRNA has a
<20-nt poly(A) tail, for which the identified PLE-like sequence is responsible.
These results indicate that the presence of a PLE can predict mRNAs with <20-nt
poly(A) tails, and that nuclear regulation of poly(A) tail length is a feature of
many mRNAs.

and SEF-2 in the murine brain.

Somatostatin receptor type II expression in the mammalian brain displays a
spatially and temporally very restricted pattern. In an investigation of the
molecular mechanisms controlling these patterns, we have recently shown that
binding of the transcription factor SEF-2 to a novel initiator element in the
SSTR-2 promoter is essential for SSTR-2 gene expression. Further characterization
of the promoter identified a species-conserved TC-rich enhancer element. By
screening a mouse brain cDNA expression library, we cloned a cDNA encoding the
transcription factor MIBP1. MIBP1 interacts specifically with both the TC box in 
the SSTR-2 promoter and with the SEF-2 initiator-binding protein to enhance
transcription from the basal SSTR-2 promoter. We then investigated SSTR-2, SEF-2,
and MIBP1 mRNA expression patterns in the developing and adult murine brain by
Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. While SEF-2 is widely expressed in
many neuronal and nonneuronal tissues, MIBP1 expression overlapped precisely with
expression of SSTR-2 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. In summary, our data 
for the first time define a regulatory role for the transcription factor MIBP1 in
mediating spatially and temporally regulated SSTR-2 expression in the brain.

Interaction of transcription factors RFX1 and MIBP1 with the gamma motif of the
negative regulatory element of the hepatitis B virus core promoter.

California, School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.

The negative regulatory element (NRE) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core
promoter contains three subregions which act synergistically to suppress core
promoter activity. One of these subregions, NRE gamma, is active in both HeLa
cervical carcinoma cells and Huh7 hepatoma cells and was found to be bound by a
protein factor present in both cell types. Here we show that the transcription
factor RFX1 can bind to NRE gamma and transactivate the core promoter through
this site. Mutations which abrogated the gene-suppressive activity of NRE gamma
prevented RFX1 from binding to NRE gamma. In addition, RFX1 can bind
simultaneously, most likely as a heterodimer, with the transcription factor MIBP1
to NRE gamma. In the absence of a cloned MIBP1 gene for further studies, we
hypothesize that RFX1 acts with MIBP1 to negatively regulate the core promoter
activity through the NRE gamma site. The ability of RFX1 to transactivate the
core promoter raises the possibility that RFX1 may play a dual role in regulating
HBV gene expression.

Interactions of the transcription factors MIBP1 and RFX1 with the EP element of
the hepatitis B virus enhancer.

We previously demonstrated that MIBP1 and RFX1 polypeptides associate in vivo to 
form a complex that binds to the MIF-1 element in the c-myc gene and the major
histocompatibility complex class II X-box recognition sequence. We now show that 
the EP element, a key regulatory sequence within hepatitis B virus enhancer I,
also associates with MIBP1 and RFX1. Using polyclonal antisera directed against
either oligonucleotide-purified MIBP1 or a peptide derived from the major
histocompatibility complex class II promoter-binding protein RFX1, we showed that
MIBP1 and RFX1 are both present in the DNA-protein complexes at the EP site. In
addition, while the EP element can act cooperatively with several adjacent
elements to transactivate hepatitis B virus expression, we demonstrated that the 
EP site alone can repress transcription of simian virus 40 promoter in a
position- and orientation-independent manner, suggesting a silencer function in
hepatocarcinoma cells.

Specific binding of nuclear proteins to the region of transcriptional attenuation
has been shown to modulate the expression of c-myb, a nuclear proto-oncogene
preferentially expressed in lympho-hematopoietic cells. Here, it plays an
important role in processes of differentiation and proliferation. The mechanism
that regulates c-myb expression is not yet fully understood. The block of
transcriptional elongation which has been mapped to a 1 kb region within murine
intron 1 may represent one regulatory pathway. The DNA sequences containing the
transcriptional pause site are well conserved between murine and human species,
thus Implying similar transcription-control strategies. We compared the binding
potential of nuclear extracts (from human fibroblasts and MOLT4 as well as murine
NIH3T3- and 70Z/3B- cell lines) to oligonucleotide sequences previously shown to 
be target binding sites in the murine system. One complex containing a 70 D
protein was found to be associated specifically with transcriptionally active
leukemia cells. We performed transient expression studies with a CAT reporter
construct containing this putative enhancer sequence and yielded significant CAT 
activity. We identified further a putative 20 kD repressor protein in
transcriptionally silent cells and demonstrated that c-Jun is part of an
ubiquitously present complex. Our results confirm the participation of intron 1
in transcriptional regulation of the c-myb gene (in mouse and human) and
implicate multiple and complex regulatory mechanisms of activation during
myelomonocytic differentiation and leukemic cell growth control.

The Drosophila schnurri gene acts in the Dpp/TGF beta signaling pathway and
encodes a transcription factor homologous to the human MBP family.

Decapentaplegic (dpp), a TGF beta-related ligand, plays a key role in Drosophila 
development. Although dpp receptors have been isolated, the downstream components
of the signaling pathway remain to be identified. We have cloned the schnurri
(shn) gene and show that it encodes a putative zinc finger transcription factor
homologous to the human major histocompatibility complex-binding proteins 1 and
2. Mutations in shn affect multiple events that require dpp signaling as well as 
the transcription of dpp-responsive genes. Genetic interactions and the
strikingly similar phenotypes of mutations in shn and the dpp receptors encoded
by thick veins and punt suggest that shn plays a downstream role in dpp
signaling.

The cDNA for a c-myc intron 1 binding protein 1 (MIBP1) in the rat was isolated
from lambda gt11 and lambda ZAPII cDNA libraries. Sequencing of the cDNA clones
revealed a long ORF which encoded a putative protein of 2437 amino acid residues.
This protein has two widely separated zinc finger regions, each of which carries 
C2H2 motifs. When expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein, part of the MIBP1
showed sequence-specific binding to the target sequence, i.e., a 9-bp sequence in
the rat c-myc intron 1. MIBP1 is most likely the rat counterpart of human MHC
binding protein-2 (MBP-2/HIV-EP2), based on the 86% similarity in nucleotide
sequence and 93% similarity in amno acid sequence. Northern blotting revealed a
high level of MIBP1 mRNA in the brain.

Structure and expression of major histocompatibility complex-binding protein 2, a
275-kDa zinc finger protein that binds to an enhancer of major histocompatibility
complex class I genes.

We have isolated a cDNA encoding a transcription factor that binds to the
enhancer of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes. MHC-binding
protein 2 (MBP-2) is a 275-kDa protein, containing two sets of widely separated
zinc fingers and a stretch of highly acidic amino acids, a putative
transactivation domain. The two zinc finger regions, when expressed individually 
as bacterial fusion proteins, bind with highest affinity to the MHC class I gene 
enhancer. Several proteins found in mammalian nuclear extracts bind the MHC class
I enhancer in an electrophoresis mobility shift assay. Only one of these, a
ubiquitously expressed factor, forming a slow-migrating retarded complex, can be 
supershifted by a MBP-2 antiserum. The same antiserum also precipitates a protein
of greater than 250 kDa from COS cells transfected with a MBP-2 expression
vector. Our data indicate that MBP-2 is a transcription factor involved in the
regulation of MHC class I gene expression.

HIV-EP2, a new member of the gene family encoding the human immunodeficiency

At least two different types of proteins, NF-kappa B/KBF1 and
HIV-EP1/PRDII-BF1/MBP-1, which are members of a family of rel oncoproteins and
metal-finger proteins, respectively, bind to the human immunodeficiency virus
type (HIV-1) enhancer. As a new member of a HIV-EP1 family that is expressed at a
high level in T cells, we have isolated cDNA clones of HIV-EP2 by
cross-hybridization with HIV-EP1 cDNA. HIV-EP2 protein consists of 1,833 amino
acids and has a molecular weight of 211,000. HIV-EP2 protein is highly homologous
with HIV-EP1/PRDII-BF1/MBP-1 in three regions. These three regions contain the
potential nuclear localization signal followed by a Ser/Thr-rich region, the
DNA-binding domain consisting of a metal-finger structure, and a cluster of
acidic amino acids. The DNA-binding property of HIV-EP2 was similar to that of
HIV-EP1. Northern blot analysis of HIV-EP2 mRNA indicated relatively high
expression in the T cell line Molt-4 and in some tumor cell lines. Furthermore,
like HIV-EP1, expression of HIV-EP2 mRNA was greatly induced by mitogen and
phorbol ester treatment of Jurkat T cells, suggesting that HIV-EP2 acts in HIV
production from latently infected T cells.
