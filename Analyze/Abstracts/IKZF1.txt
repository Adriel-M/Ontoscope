Comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) applications have recently
identified various recurrent kinase and cytokine receptor rearrangements in
Ph-like B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) amenable to
tyrosin kinase inhibitor treatment. For rapid diagnostics of kinase pathway
aberrations in minimal residual disease (MRD) high-risk BCP-ALL, we developed a
PCR-independent NGS custom enrichment capture panel targeting recurrent genomic
alterations, which allows for the identification of unknown 5' fusion partner
genes and precise mapping of variable genomic breakpoints. Using a standardized
bioinformatics algorithm, we identified kinase and cytokine receptor
rearrangements in the majority of ALL patients with high burden of postinduction 
MRD and enrichment of IKZF1 mutation or deletion (IKZF1(del) ).

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs with high frequency in childhood and is
associated with high mortality in adults. Recent technical advances in
next-generation sequencing have shed light on genetic abnormalities in
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as the precursor to ALL pathogenesis. Based
on these genetic abnormalities, ALL is now being reclassified into newly
identified subtypes. Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) B-lineage ALL is one 
of the new high-risk subtypes characterized by genetic alterations that activate 
various signaling pathways, including those involving cytokine receptors,
tyrosine kinases, and epigenetic modifiers. Ph-like ALL is essentially
heterogeneous; however, deletion mutations in the IKZF1 gene encoding the
transcription factor IKAROS underlie many cases as a key factor inducing
aggressive phenotypes and poor treatment responses. Whole-genome sequencing
studies of ALL patients and ethnically matched controls also identified inherited
genetic variations in lymphoid neoplasm-related genes, which are likely to
increase ALL susceptibility. These findings are directly relevant to clinical
hematology, and further studies on this aspect could contribute to accurate
diagnosis, effective monitoring of residual disease, and patient-oriented
therapies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by
late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia in the absence of predisposing factors. The
genetic cause is unknown in the majority of cases, and less than 10% of patients 
have a family history of the disease. Most patients have normal numbers of B
cells but lack plasma cells.
METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing and array-based comparative genomic
hybridization to evaluate a subset of patients with CVID and low B-cell numbers. 
Mutant proteins were analyzed for DNA binding with the use of an electrophoretic 
mobility-shift assay (EMSA) and confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to
analyze peripheral-blood lymphocytes and bone marrow aspirates.
RESULTS: Six different heterozygous mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding the
transcription factor IKAROS, were identified in 29 persons from six families. In 
two families, the mutation was a de novo event in the proband. All the mutations,
four amino acid substitutions, an intragenic deletion, and a 4.7-Mb multigene
deletion involved the DNA-binding domain of IKAROS. The proteins bearing missense
mutations failed to bind target DNA sequences on EMSA and confocal microscopy;
however, they did not inhibit the binding of wild-type IKAROS. Studies in family 
members showed progressive loss of B cells and serum immunoglobulins. Bone marrow
aspirates in two patients had markedly decreased early B-cell precursors, but
plasma cells were present. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed in 2 of the 29 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor IKAROS caused an 
autosomal dominant form of CVID that is associated with a striking decrease in
B-cell numbers. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

University of California, San Francisco.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is nearly 20%
higher among Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites. Previous studies have shown
evidence for association between risk of ALL and variation within IKZF1, ARID5B, 
CEBPE, CDKN2A, GATA3, and BM1-PIP4K2A genes. However, variants identified only
account for <10% of the genetic risk of ALL.
METHODS: We applied pathway-based analyses to GWAS data from the California
Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biological pathways were 
overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied 
causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within 
each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among
SNPs.
RESULTS: Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may
involve distinct biological mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism
across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein
digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration,
and focal adhesion (PFDR < 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to
downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell
malignancies. Several candidate genes for ALL, such as COL6A6 and COL5A1 were
identified through targeted maximum likelihood estimation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show distinct biological pathways are
overrepresented in different ALL subtypes using pathway-based approaches, and
identified potential gene candidates using causal inference methods.
IMPACT: The findings demonstrate that newly developed bioinformatics tools and
causal inference methods can provide insights to furthering our understanding of 
the pathogenesis of leukemia.

We report a case of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with an atypical
t(9;22;15)(p24;q11;q21) translocation, leading to a BCR-JAK2 fusion, associated
with a trisomy of chromosome 8 in clonal evolution at karyotype. Patient's
evolution was marked by an aggressive clinical course with rapid progression to
blast phase within the first year after diagnosis. Examination of matched chronic
phase and blast crisis samples by SNP-array karyotyping identified secondary
acquired cryptic genetic events at the time of lymphoblastic transformation,
including biallelic IKZF1 alteration and EBF1 and CDKN2A/B codeletions. This case
is the first report describing acquisition of secondary genetic events leading to
acute lymphoblastic progression in a rare MPN with BCR-JAK2 fusion. This article

Protein signaling and regulation of gene transcription in leukemia: role of the
Casein Kinase II-Ikaros axis.

Protein signaling and regulation of gene expression are the two major mechanisms 
that regulate cellular proliferation in leukemia. Discerning the function of
these processes is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of leukemia and
for developing the targeted therapies. Here, we provide an overview of one of the
mechanisms that regulates gene transcription in leukemia. This mechanism involves
the direct interaction between Casein Kinase II (CK2) and the Ikaros
transcription factor. Ikaros (IKZF1) functions as a master regulator of
hematopoiesis and a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Impaired Ikaros function results in the development of high-risk leukemia. Ikaros
binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and regulates their
transcription via chromatin remodeling. In vivo, Ikaros is a target for CK2, a
pro-oncogenic kinase. CK2 directly phosphorylates Ikaros at multiple amino acids.
Functional experiments showed that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ikaros,
regulates Ikaros' DNA binding affinity, subcellular localization and protein
stability. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2
regulates Ikaros binding and repression of the terminal deoxytransferase (TdT)
gene in normal thymocytes and in T-cell ALL. Available data suggest that the
oncogenic activity of CK2 in leukemia involves functional inactivation of Ikaros 
and provide a rationale for CK2 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ALL.

Structural basis of lenalidomide-induced CK1a degradation by the CRL4(CRBN)
ubiquitin ligase.

Thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are immune
modulatory drugs (IMiDs) used in the treatment of haematologic malignancies.
IMiDs bind CRBN, the substrate receptor of the CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (also known as
CRL4(CRBN)) E3 ubiquitin ligase, and inhibit ubiquitination of endogenous
CRL4(CRBN) substrates. Unexpectedly, IMiDs also repurpose the ligase to target
new proteins for degradation. Lenalidomide induces degradation of the lymphoid
transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos (also known as IKZF1 and IKZF3), and
casein kinase 1a (CK1a), which contributes to its clinical efficacy in the
treatment of multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion associated myelodysplastic syndrome
(del(5q) MDS), respectively. How lenalidomide alters the specificity of the
ligase to degrade these proteins remains elusive. Here we present the 2.45 Å
crystal structure of DDB1-CRBN bound to lenalidomide and CK1a. CRBN and
lenalidomide jointly provide the binding interface for a CK1a ß-hairpin-loop
located in the kinase N-lobe. We show that CK1a binding to CRL4(CRBN) is strictly
dependent on the presence of an IMiD. Binding of IKZF1 to CRBN similarly requires
the compound and both, IKZF1 and CK1a, use a related binding mode. Our study
provides a mechanistic explanation for the selective efficacy of lenalidomide in 
del(5q) MDS therapy. We anticipate that high-affinity protein-protein
interactions induced by small molecules will provide opportunities for drug
development, particularly for targeted protein degradation.

Recent studies have identified oncogenic lesions in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive (Ph+)<U+2009> acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and ABL1 kinase
mutations that confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We sought to
determine the prevalence and clinical impact of these lesions in patients on
CALGB 10001, a previously reported Phase II study of imatinib, chemotherapy, and 
hematopoietic cell transplant in adult Ph<U+2009>+<U+2009>ALL. Of the 58 enrolled, 22 relapsed.
By direct sequencing, an ABL1 kinase mutation known to induce imatinib resistance
was present at relapse in 13 of 20. Using quantitative PCR assays, the mutations 
were detectable at diagnosis or early during treatment in most (62%) relapsed
patients. Aberrations in IKZF1, CDKN2A/B, and PAX5 were assessed in 28 samples
using SNP arrays and genomic DNA sequencing. Of these, 22 (79%) had IKZF1
deletion. The combination of IKZF1 deletion and p210 BCR-ABL1 (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001), high 
white blood cell count (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021), and minimal residual disease (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013) were
associated with worse disease-free survival.

Preliminary Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) whole exome sequencing (WES)
studies have identified a huge number of somatic mutations affecting more than a 
hundred different genes mainly in a non-recurrent manner, suggesting that APL is 
a heterogeneous disease with secondary relevant changes not yet defined. To
extend our knowledge of subtle genetic alterations involved in APL that might
cooperate with PML/RARA in the leukemogenic process, we performed a comprehensive
analysis of somatic mutations in APL combining WES with sequencing of a custom
panel of targeted genes by next-generation sequencing. To select a reduced subset
of high confidence candidate driver genes, further in silico analysis were
carried out. After prioritization and network analysis we found recurrent
deleterious mutations in 8 individual genes (STAG2, U2AF1, SMC1A, USP9X, IKZF1,
LYN, MYCBP2 and PTPN11) with a strong potential of being involved in APL
pathogenesis. Our network analysis of multiple mutations provides a reliable
approach to prioritize genes for additional analysis, improving our knowledge of 
the leukemogenesis interactome. Additionally, we have defined a functional module
in the interactome of APL. The hypothesis is that the number, or the specific
combinations, of mutations harbored in each patient might not be as important as 
the disturbance caused in biological key functions, triggered by several not
necessarily recurrent mutations.

OBJECTIVE: To identify ikaros family zinc finger1 (IKZF1) deletion in patients
with pediatric B cells-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) without reproducible 
chromosomal abnomalities and further investigate its value in this part of
patients' pathogenesis and prognosis.
METHOD: The study was approved by the institutional review board of the authors' 
hospital and informed consent was obtained from the patients and/or their legal
guardians. Data of 96 children with B-ALL patients without reproducible
cytogenetic abnormalities whose bone marrows specimens were enough for DNA
extraction for the detection were retrospectively selected. All the patients were
diagnosed and systematically treated according to CCLG-ALL2008 in our hospital
from April 2008 to April 2013. The 96 patients were divided into two groups
according to the result of IKZF1's detection by multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA): The cases that with any of eight exons of IKZF1
deleted were entered into"Group with IKZF1 deletion"otherwise entered"Group
without IKZF1 deletion". Disease free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS)
and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups.
RESULT: Nineteen out of 96 B-ALL patients without reproducible cytogenetic
abnormalities had IKZF1 deletion (20%). Three of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions
of the whole gene; ten of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of exon 1; 4 of 19
patients with IKZF1 deletions of exons 4-7; one of 19 patients with IKZF1
deletions of exons 2-7 and one of 19 patients with IKZF1 deletions of exons 1-6. 
Whose white blood cell (WBC)=50×10(9)/L inIKZF1 diletion group was more than
whthout IKZF1 deletion group(42% vs. 13%, P=0.004). Patients with IKZF1 deletions
had a lower 3-year DFS (0.67±0.13 vs. 0.93±0.04, P=0.001); EFS (0.67±0.13 vs.
0.90±0.04, P=0.012) and OS(0.79±0.09 vs. 0.96±0.02, P=0.010) compared to those
without IKZF1 deletions. Excluding the influence of sex, age, WBC count at
diagnosis, cerebrospinal fluid state and prednisone response IKZF1 deletion still
affected the patients' DFS, EFS and OS ( P<0.05 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION: Some of pediatric B-cell precursor ALL without reproducible
cytogenetic abnormalities had been detected to have IKZF1 deletion; IKZF1
deletion is an independent poor prognostic factor in these patients.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proved the association of IKZF1
polymorphisms with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present
study, we aimed to inspect the impact of IKZF1 gene polymorphisms and childhood
ALL in a sample of Iranian population who live in south east of Iran. This
case-control study was done on 110 children diagnosed with ALL and 120 healthy
children. The IKZF1 (rs4132601 T<U+2009>><U+2009>G, rs11978267 A<U+2009>><U+2009>G, rs11980379 T<U+2009>><U+2009>C, and
rs10272724 T<U+2009>><U+2009>C) polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that
rs4132601 T<U+2009>><U+2009>G polymorphism increased the risk of ALL in the codominant
(OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.96, 95 % CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.58-5.54, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0008, TG vs TT; and OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.75, 95 %

CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.61-5.19, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0004, TG<U+2009>+<U+2009>GG vs TT) inheritance models. On the other hand,
the rs4132601 G allele increased the risk of ALL (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.86, 95 % CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.28-2.96;
p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0011) in comparison with the T allele. We have also showed that rs11980379 
T<U+2009>><U+2009>C variant increased the risk of ALL in codominant (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.43, 95 %
CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.28-4.60, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0076, TC vs TT; and OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.35, 95 % CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.14-4.85,

study also revealed that the rs10272724 T<U+2009>><U+2009>C polymorphism increased the risk of 
ALL in codominant (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.18, 95 % CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.19-3.99, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0115, TC vs TT; and

95 % CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.30-4.08, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0049, TC<U+2009>+<U+2009>CC vs TT) inheritance models. On the one
hand, the rs11980379 C allele increased the risk of ALL (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.70, 95 %
CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.17-2.46, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0062) compared with T allele, while the rs11978267 A/G
polymorphism was not associated with ALL risk. In conclusion, our findings
confirm the impact of IKZF1 polymorphisms on childhood ALL risk in a sample of
Iranian population. Further studies with larger sample sizes and different
ethnicities are needed to confirm our findings.

BACKGROUND: The genetic mechanisms underlying hemangioblastoma development are
still largely unknown. We used high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism
microarrays and droplet digital PCR analysis to detect copy number variations
(CNVs) in total of 45 hemangioblastoma tumors.
RESULTS: We identified 94 CNVs with a median of 18 CNVs per sample. The most
frequently gained regions were on chromosomes 1 (p36.32) and 7 (p11.2). These
regions contain the EGFR and PRDM16 genes. Recurrent losses were located at
chromosome 12 (q24.13), which includes the gene PTPN11.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first high-resolution genome-wide view of
chromosomal changes in hemangioblastoma and identify 23 candidate genes: EGFR,
PRDM16, PTPN11, HOXD11, HOXD13, FLT3, PTCH, FGFR1, FOXP1, GPC3, HOXC13, HOXC11,
MKL1, CHEK2, IRF4, GPHN, IKZF1, RB1, HOXA9, and micro RNA, such as hsa-mir-196a-2
for hemangioblastoma pathogenesis. Furthermore, our data implicate that cell
proliferation and angiogenesis promoting pathways may be involved in the
molecular pathogenesis of hemangioblastoma.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of a new blood test for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) to an established fecal immunochemical test (FIT) in a study population
with the full range of neoplastic and non-neoplastic pathologies encountered in
the colon and rectum.
METHODS: Volunteers were asked to complete a FIT prior to colonoscopy. Blood was 
collected after bowel preparation but prior to colonoscopy, and plasma was
assayed for the presence of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA using a multiplex
real-time PCR assay. Sensitivity and specificity estimates for the blood test
were calculated from true- and false-positive rates for neoplasia and compared
with FIT at a range of fecal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration positivity thresholds.
RESULTS: In total, 1,381 volunteers (median age 64 years; 49% male) completed
both tests prior to colonoscopy. Estimated sensitivity of the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood
test for CRC was 62% (41/66; 95% confidence interval 49-74%) with a specificity
of 92% (1207/1315; 90-93%). FIT returned the same specificity at a cutoff of
60<U+2009>µg Hb/g, at which its corresponding sensitivity for cancer was 64% (42/66;
51-75%). In the range of commonly used FIT cutoffs, respective cancer sensitivity
and specificity estimates with FIT were: 59% (46-71%) and 93% (92-95%) at 80<U+2009>µg
Hb/g, and 79% (67-88%) and 81% (78-83%) at 10<U+2009>µg Hb/g. Although estimated
sensitivities were not significantly different between the two tests for any
stage of cancer, FIT showed a significantly higher sensitivity for advanced
adenoma at the lower cutoffs. Specificity of FIT, but not of the BCAT1/IKZF1
blood test, deteriorated substantially in people with overt blood in the feces.
When combining FIT (cutoff 10<U+2009>µg Hb/g) with the BCAT1/IKZF1 blood test,
sensitivity for cancer was 89% (79-96%) at 74% (72-77%) specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: A test based on detection of methylated BCAT1/IKZF1 DNA in blood has
comparable sensitivity but better specificity for CRC than FIT at the commonly
used positivity threshold of 10<U+2009>µg Hb/g. Further evaluation of the new test
relative to FIT in the population screening context is now required to fully
understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of these biomarkers in
screening.

BACKGROUND: A deregulated CRLF2 (d-CRLF2) expression was described in B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia without recurrent fusion genes (B-NEG ALL). While
the role of d-CRLF2 in children has been extensively described, little is known
about its role and impact in adult ALL.
METHODS: Expression levels of CRLF2 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR 
in 102 newly-diagnosed adult B-NEG ALL and correlated with the clinico-biological
characteristics and outcome. Incidence and clinical impact of the P2RY8/CRLF2
transcript was also assessed.
RESULTS: High CRLF2 levels, as continuous variable, were significantly associated
with hyperleucocytosis (p=0.0002) and thrombocytopenia (p=0.005); when a
cut-point at <U+0394>Ct=8 was applied, 35 cases (34.3%), mostly males (80%), proved
positive for CRLF2 expression. High CRLF2 levels, as continuous or categorical
variable, were associated with a worse disease-free (p=0.003 and p=0.015) and
overall survival (p=0.017 and 0.0038). Furthermore, when CRLF2 was analyzed as a 
categorical variable, a high statistical association was found with IKZF1
deletion and mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway (p=0.001 and p<0.0001,
respectively). Finally, the P2RY8/CRLF2 transcript, identified in 8/102 patients 
(7.8%), was associated with a poor outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: In adult B-NEG ALL, high CRLF2 expression is associated with
distinct clinico-biological features and an unfavourable prognosis in both
univariate and multivariate analysis; similarly, P2RY8/CRLF2 positivity
correlates with a poor outcome. The quantification of CRLF2 is an important
prognostic marker in adult B-lineage ALL without known genetic lesions.

BACKGROUND: Poor participation rates are often observed in colorectal cancer
(CRC) screening programs utilising faecal occult blood tests. This may be from
dislike of faecal sampling, or having benign bleeding conditions that can
interfere with test results. These barriers may be circumvented by offering a
blood-based DNA test for screening. The aim was to determine if program
participation could be increased by offering a blood test following faecal
immunochemical test (FIT) non-participation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: People were invited into a CRC screening study through
their General Practice and randomised into control or intervention (n=600/group).
Both groups were mailed a FIT (matching conventional screening programs).
Participation was defined as FIT completion within 12wk. Intervention group
non-participants were offered a screening blood test (methylated BCAT1/IKZF1).
Overall participation was compared between the groups.
RESULTS: After 12wk, FIT participation was 82% and 81% in the control and
intervention groups. In the intervention 96 FIT non- participants were offered
the blood test - 22 completed this test and 19 completed the FIT instead. Total
screening in the intervention group was greater than the control (88% vs 82%,
p<0.01). Of 12 invitees who indicated that FIT was inappropriate for them (mainly
due to bleeding conditions), 10 completed the blood test (83%).
CONCLUSIONS: Offering a blood test to FIT non-participants increased overall
screening participation compared to a conventional FIT program. Blood test
participation was particularly high in invitees who considered FIT to be
inappropriate for them. A blood test may be a useful adjunct test within a FIT
program.

INTRODUCTION: IKZF1 deletions have been reported with variable frequency in
B-ALL. This study was carried out to find the prevalence and profile of IKZF1
deletions and their correlation in B-ALL.
METHODS: The untreated B-ALL cases were prospectively analyzed for IKZF1
deletions over a period of eleven months using multiplex ligation dependent probe
amplification (MLPA). The IKZF1 deletions were classified into three functional
groups-dominant negative, haploinsufficiency and others. The response to
induction chemotherapy was correlated with the IKZF1 deletion status.
RESULTS: The median age of 101 cases was 7 years (1-67) with 82 pediatric (<18
years) cases. Fifteen cases were positive for BCR-ABL. The IKZF1 deletions were
detected in 29 (28.7%) cases; 53% BCR-ABL positive, 24% BCR-ABL negative, 47%
adult and 24% pediatric cases. Out of the 29 deletions, 19 (66%) were
haploinsufficiency, 8 (28%) were dominant negative and 2 others. The IKZF1
deleted cases had higher induction failure rates compared to the cases without
IKZF1 deletions.
CONCLUSIONS: The IKZF1 deletions were detected in 28.7% B-ALL patients. These
were more common in BCR-ABL positive and adult B-ALL compared to the BCR-ABL
negative and pediatric cases, respectively. The haploinsufficiency was commoner
than dominant negative IKZF1 deletions. IKZF1 deletions correlated with higher
induction failure.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms: Current molecular biology and genetics.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by
increased production of mature blood cells. Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPNs
(Ph-MPNs) consist of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 
primary myelofibrosis (PMF). A number of stem cell derived mutations have been
identified in the past 10 years. These findings showed that JAK2V617F, as a
diagnostic marker involving JAK2 exon 14 with a high frequency, is the best
molecular characterization of Ph-MPNs. Somatic mutations in an endoplasmic
reticulum chaperone, named calreticulin (CALR), is the second most common
mutation in patients with ET and PMF after JAK2 V617F mutation. Discovery of CALR
mutations led to the increased molecular diagnostic of ET and PMF up to 90%. It
has been shown that JAK2V617F is not the unique event in disease pathogenesis.
Some other genes' location such as TET oncogene family member 2 (TET2),
additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene
(CBL), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/IDH2), IKAROS family zinc finger 1
(IKZF1), DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), tumor protein p53 (TP53),
runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and high mobility group AT-hook 2
(HMGA2) have also identified to be involved in MPNs phenotypes. Here, current
molecular biology and genetic mechanisms involved in MNPs with a focus on the
aforementioned factors is presented.

Our aim was to identify miRNAs that can predict risk of relapse in pediatric
patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Following high-throughput miRNA
expression analysis (48 samples), five miRs were selected for further
confirmation performed by real time quantitative PCR on a cohort of precursor
B-cell ALL patients (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>138). The results were correlated with clinical
parameters and outcome. Low expression of miR-151-5p, and miR-451, and high
expression of miR-1290 or a combination of all three predicted inferior relapse
free survival (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007, 0.042, 0.025, and <0.0001, respectively). Cox
regression analysis identified aberrant expression of the three miRs as an
independent prognostic marker with a 10.5-fold increased risk of relapse
(P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.041) in PCR-MRD non-high risk patients. Furthermore, following exclusion
of patients harboring IKZF1 deletion, the aberrant expression of all three miRs
could identify patients with a 24.5-fold increased risk to relapse (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). 
The prognostic relevance of the three miRNAs was evaluated in a non-BFM treated
precursor B-cell ALL cohort (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>33). A significant correlation between an
aberrant expression of at least one of the three miRs and poor outcome was
maintained (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). Our results identify an expression profile of
miR-151-5p, miR-451, and miR-1290 as a novel biomarker for outcome in pediatric
precursor B-cell ALL patients, regardless of treatment protocol. The use of these
markers may lead to improved risk stratification at diagnosis and allow early
therapeutic interventions in an attempt to improve survival of high risk
patients. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Current therapeutic strategies for sickle cell anemia are aimed at reactivating
fetal hemoglobin. Pomalidomide, a third-generation immunomodulatory drug, was
proposed to induce fetal hemoglobin production by an unknown mechanism. Here, we 
report that pomalidomide induced a fetal-like erythroid differentiation program, 
leading to a reversion of <U+03B3>-globin silencing in adult human erythroblasts.
Pomalidomide acted early by transiently delaying erythropoiesis at the
burst-forming unit-erythroid/colony-forming unit-erythroid transition, but
without affecting terminal differentiation. Further, the transcription networks
involved in <U+03B3>-globin repression were selectively and differentially affected by
pomalidomide including BCL11A, SOX6, IKZF1, KLF1, and LSD1. IKAROS (IKZF1), a
known target of pomalidomide, was degraded by the proteasome, but was not the key
effector of this program, because genetic ablation of IKZF1 did not phenocopy
pomalidomide treatment. Notably, the pomalidomide-induced reprogramming was
conserved in hematopoietic progenitors from individuals with sickle cell anemia. 
Moreover, multiple myeloma patients treated with pomalidomide demonstrated
increased in vivo <U+03B3>-globin levels in their erythrocytes. Together, these data
reveal the molecular mechanisms by which pomalidomide reactivates fetal
hemoglobin, reinforcing its potential as a treatment for patients with
ß-hemoglobinopathies.

Network-based molecular modeling of physiological behaviors has proven invaluable
in the study of complex diseases such as cancer, but these approaches remain
largely untested in contexts involving interacting tissues such as autoimmunity. 
Here, using Alopecia Areata (AA) as a model, we have adapted regulatory network
analysis to specifically isolate physiological behaviors in the skin that
contribute to the recruitment of immune cells in autoimmune disease. We use
context-specific regulatory networks to deconvolve and identify skin-specific
regulatory modules with IKZF1 and DLX4 as master regulators (MRs). These MRs are 
sufficient to induce AA-like molecular states in vitro in three cultured cell
lines, resulting in induced NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity. This work demonstrates 
the feasibility of a network-based approach for compartmentalizing and targeting 
molecular behaviors contributing to interactions between tissues in autoimmune
disease.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder
whose etiology is incompletely understood, but likely involves environmental
triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. We sought to identify the
genetic loci associated with SLE in a Korean population by performing an unbiased
genome-wide association scan.
METHODS: A total of 1,174 Korean SLE cases and 4,248 population controls were
genotyped with strict quality control measures and analyzed for association. For 
select variants, replication was tested in an independent set of 1,412 SLE cases 
and 1,163 population controls of Korean and Chinese ancestries.
RESULTS: Eleven regions outside the HLA exceeded genome-wide significance
(P<5x10(-8) ). A novel SNP-SLE association was identified between FCHSD2 and
P2RY2 peaking at rs11235667 (P = 1.0x10(-8) , odds ratio (OR) = 0.59) on a 33kb
haplotype upstream to ATG16L2. Replication for rs11235667 resulted in Pmeta-rep
=0.001 and Pmeta-overall =6.67x10(-11) (OR=0.63). Within the HLA region,
association peaked in the Class II region at rs116727542 with multiple
independent effects. Classical HLA allele imputation identified HLA-DRB1*1501 and
HLA-DQB1*0602, both highly correlated, as most strongly associated with SLE. We
replicated ten previously established SLE risk loci: STAT1-STAT4, TNFSF4,
TNFAIP3, IKZF1, HIP1, IRF5, BLK, WDFY4, ETS1 and IRAK1-MECP2. Of these loci, we
identified previously unreported independent second effects in TNFAIP3 and TNFSF4
as well as differences in the association for a putative causal variant in the
WDFY4 region.
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to identify true SLE risk effects in
other suggestive loci and to identify the causal variant(s) in the regions of
ATG16L2, FCHSD2, and P2RY2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and
pomalidomide are efficacious in the treatment of multiple myeloma and
significantly prolong their survival. However, the mechanisms of such effects of 
IMiDs have not been fully elucidated. Recently, cereblon has been identified as a
target binding protein of thalidomide. Lenalidomide-resistant myeloma cell lines 
often lose the expression of cereblon, suggesting that IMiDs act as an
anti-myeloma agent through interacting with cereblon. Cereblon binds to damaged
DNA-binding protein and functions as a ubiquitin ligase, inducing degradation of 
IKZF1 and IKZF3 that are essential transcription factors for B and T cell
development. Degradation of both IKZF1 and IKZF3 reportedly suppresses myeloma
cell growth. Here, we found that IMiDs act as inhibitors of DNA
methyltransferases (DMNTs). We previously reported that PU.1, which is an ETS
family transcription factor and essential for myeloid and lymphoid development,
functions as a tumor suppressor in myeloma cells. PU.1 induces growth arrest and 
apoptosis of myeloma cell lines. In this study, we found that low-dose
lenalidomide and pomalidomide up-regulate PU.1 expression through inducing
demethylation of the PU.1 promoter. In addition, IMiDs inhibited DNMT1, DNMT3a,
and DNMT3b activities in vitro. Furthermore, lenalidomide and pomalidomide
decreased the methylation status of the whole genome in myeloma cells.
Collectively, IMiDs exert demethylation activity through inhibiting DNMT1, 3a,
and 3b, and up-regulating PU.1 expression, which may be one of the mechanisms of 
the anti-myeloma activity of IMiDs.

Impaired function of the Ikaros (IKZF1) protein is associated with the
development of high-risk B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).
The mechanisms of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity in leukemia are unknown.
Ikaros binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and
regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. Here, we report that
Ikaros represses transcription of the histone H3K4 demethylase, JARID1B (KDM5B). 
Transcriptional repression of JARID1B is associated with increased global levels 
of H3K4 trimethylation. Ikaros-mediated repression of JARID1B is dependent on the
activity of the histone deacetylase, HDAC1, which binds to the upstream
regulatory element of JARID1B in complex with Ikaros. In leukemia, JARID1B is
overexpressed, and its inhibition results in cellular growth arrest.
Ikaros-mediated repression of JARID1B in leukemia is impaired by pro-oncogenic
casein kinase 2 (CK2). Inhibition of CK2 results in increased binding of the
Ikaros-HDAC1 complex to the promoter of JARID1B, with increased formation of
trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 and decreased histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation. In
cases of high-risk B-ALL that carry deletion of one Ikaros (IKZF1) allele,
targeted inhibition of CK2 restores Ikaros binding to the JARID1B promoter and
repression of JARID1B. In summary, the presented data suggest a mechanism through
which Ikaros and HDAC1 regulate the epigenetic signature in leukemia: via
regulation of JARID1B transcription. The presented data identify JARID1B as a
novel therapeutic target in B-ALL and provide a rationale for the use of CK2
inhibitors in the treatment of high-risk B-ALL.

Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

The RCSD1 gene has recently been identified as a novel gene fusion partner of the
ABL1 gene in cases of B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL). The RCSD1 gene
is located at 1q23 and ABL1 is located at 9q34, so that the RCSD1-ABL1 fusion
typically arises through a rare reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q23;q34). Only a 
small number of RCSD1-ABL1 positive cases of B-ALL have been described in the
literature, and the full spectrum of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic,
and molecular features associated with this genetic abnormality has not been
defined. We describe extensive genetic characterization of a case of B-ALL with
RCSD1-ABL1 fusion, by using conventional cytogenetic analysis, Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) studies, and Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA). The
use of CMA resulted in detection of an approximately 70<U+2009>kb deletion at 7p12.2,
which caused a disruption of the IKZF1 gene. Deletions and mutations of IKZF1 are
recurring abnormalities in B-ALL and are associated with a poor prognosis. Our
findings highlight the association of the deletion of IKZF1 gene with the
t(1;9)(q24;q34) and illustrate the importance of comprehensive cytogenetic and
molecular evaluation for accurate prediction of prognosis in patients with B-cell
ALL.

OBJECTIVE: To identify IKZF1 gene copy number abnormalities in BCR/ABL-negative
B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children, and to investigate
the association between such abnormalities and prognosis.
METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was applied to
detect IKZF1 gene copy number abnormalities in 180 children diagnosed with
BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL. These children were classified into IKZF1 deletion group 
and IKZF1 normal group according to the presence or absence of IKZF1 gene
deletion. The association between IKZF1 copy number abnormalities and prognosis
of children with BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL was analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Among 180 children, 27 (15.0%) had IKZF1 deletion; among the 27
children, 4 had complete deletions of 8 exons of IKZF1 gene, 17 had deletion of
exon 1, 3 had deletions of exons 4-7, and 3 children had deletions of exons 2-7. 
Compared with those in the IKZF1 normal group, children in the IKZF1 deletion
group had higher white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of individuals with 
high risk of minimal residual disease at the first visit. IKZF1 deletions often
occurred in BCR/ABL-negative children with no special fusion gene abnormalities. 
They were frequently accompanied by abnormalities in chromosomes 11, 8, 5, 7, and
21. The analysis with Kaplan-Meier method showed that disease-free survival (DFS)
in the IKZF1 deletion group was significantly lower than that in the IKZF1 normal
group (0.740 ± 0.096 vs 0.905 ± 0.034; P=0.002). Cox analysis showed that after
exclusion of sex, age, initial WBC count, cerebrospinal fluid state at the first 
visit, prednisone response, and chromosome karyotype, IKZF1 deletion still
affected the children's DFS (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Some children with BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL have IKZF1 deletion, and
IKZF1 deletion is an independent risk factor for DFS in children with
BCR/ABL-negative B-ALL.

The extent to which heritable genetic variants can affect tumor development has
yet to be fully elucidated. Tumor selection of single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) risk alleles, a phenomenon called preferential allelic imbalance (PAI), has
been demonstrated in some cancer types. We developed a novel application of
digital PCR termed Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test using Droplet Digital PCR 
(SMART-ddPCR) for accurate assessment of tumor PAI, and have applied this method 
to test the hypothesis that heritable SNPs associated with childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may demonstrate tumor PAI. These SNPs are located at
CDKN2A (rs3731217) and IKZF1 (rs4132601), genes frequently lost in ALL, and at
CEBPE (rs2239633), ARID5B (rs7089424), PIP4K2A (rs10764338), and GATA3
(rs3824662), genes located on chromosomes gained in high-hyperdiploid ALL. We
established thresholds of AI using constitutional DNA from SNP heterozygotes, and
subsequently measured allelic copy number in tumor DNA from 19-142 heterozygote
samples per SNP locus. We did not find significant tumor PAI at these loci,
though CDKN2A and IKZF1 SNPs showed a trend towards preferential selection of the
risk allele (p = 0.17 and p = 0.23, respectively). Using a genomic copy number
control ddPCR assay, we investigated somatic copy number alterations (SCNA)
underlying AI at CDKN2A and IKZF1, revealing a complex range of alterations
including homozygous and hemizygous deletions and copy-neutral loss of
heterozygosity, with varying degrees of clonality. Copy number estimates from
ddPCR showed high agreement with those from multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) assays. We demonstrate that SMART-ddPCR is a highly accurate
method for investigation of tumor PAI and for assessment of the somatic
alterations underlying AI. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas identified 16 recurrent SCNA loci that contain heritable 
cancer risk SNPs associated with a matching tumor type, and which represent
candidate PAI regions warranting further investigation.

Clinical significance of high c-MYC and low MYCBP2 expression and their
association with Ikaros dysfunction in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Increased expression of c-MYC is observed in both Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
and T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). MYC binding protein 2 (MYCBP2)
is a probable E3 ubiquitin ligase and its function in leukemia is unknown. IKZF1 
deletion is associated with the development and poor outcome of ALL. Here, we
observed significant high c-MYC expression and low MYCBP2 expression in adult ALL
patients. Patients with high c-MYC expression and/or low MYCBP2 expression had
higher WBC counts and a higher percentage of CD34+ or CD33+ cells, as well as
splenomegaly, liver infiltration, higher BM blasts, and lower CR rate. Ikaros
bound to the regulatory regions of c-MYC and MYCBP2, suppressed c-MYC and
increased MYCBP2 expression in ALL cells. Expression of c-MYC mRNA was
significantly higher in patients with IKZF1 deletion; conversely MYCBP2 mRNA
expression was significantly lower in those patients. A CK2 inhibitor, which acts
as an Ikaros activator, also suppressed c-MYC and increased MYCBP2 expression in 
an Ikaros (IKZF1) dependent manner in the ALL cells. In summary, our data
indicated the correlation of high c-MYC expression, low MYCBP2 expression and
high c-MYC plus low MYCBP2 expression with high-risk factors and proliferation
markers in adult ALL patients. Our data also revealed an oncogenic role for an
Ikaros/MYCBP2/c-MYC axis in adult ALL, providing a mechanism of target therapies 
that activate Ikaros in adult ALL.

Lenalidomide and its related 'analogues' modulate the substrate specificity of
the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Polyubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 in multiple myeloma and CK1a in
del(5q) MDS has recently been linked to therapeutic efficacy of this class of
compounds. Harnessing ubiquitin ligase substrate specificity, may in time
facilitate the degradation of other 'undruggable' proteins and allow for
separation of detrimental side effects of IMiD compounds from those associated
with therapeutic efficacy.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation occurs
frequently in human progenitor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). To
identify gene alterations that cooperate with STAT5 activation to initiate
leukemia, we crossed mice expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5
(Stat5b-CA) with mice in which a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon (T2/Onc)
was mobilized only in B cells. Stat5b-CA mice typically do not develop B-ALL (<2%
penetrance); in contrast, 89% of Stat5b-CA mice in which the T2/Onc transposon
had been mobilized died of B-ALL by 3 months of age. High-throughput sequencing
approaches were used to identify genes frequently targeted by the T2/Onc
transposon; these included Sos1 (74%), Kdm2a (35%), Jak1 (26%), Bmi1 (19%),
Prdm14 or Ncoa2 (13%), Cdkn2a (10%), Ikzf1 (8%), Caap1 (6%) and Klf3 (6%).
Collectively, these mutations target three major cellular processes: (i) the
Janus kinase/STAT5 pathway (ii) progenitor B-cell differentiation and (iii) the
CDKN2A tumor-suppressor pathway. Transposon insertions typically resulted in
altered expression of these genes, as well as downstream pathways including
STAT5, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and p38. Importantly,
expression of Sos1 and Kdm2a, and activation of p38, correlated with survival,
further underscoring the role these genes and associated pathways have in
B-ALL.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 October 2015;

Genetic Predisposition to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome With Severe Ocular Surface
Complications.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is an acute inflammatory vesiculobullous reaction 
of the skin and mucosa, including the ocular surface, oral cavity, and genitals. 
In patients with extensive skin detachment and a poor prognosis, the condition is
termed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). This review covers 4 topics: (1)
ophthalmic SJS, (2) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis, (3) genome-wide
association studies, and (4) other pathogenic factors. Severe ocular
complications (SOCs) develop in some SJS/TEN patients diagnosed by
dermatologists. Cold medicine-related SJS/TEN (CM-SJS/TEN) with SOCs is
associated with HLA-A*02:06 in Japanese and Koreans and HLA-B*44:03 in Japanese, 
Indians, and Brazilian whites. We conducted a genome-wide association study for
CM-SJS/TEN with SOCs and found that IKZF1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
were significantly associated with CM-SJS/TEN with SOCs, and that the ratio of
the Ik2/Ik1 isoforms might be influenced by these IKZF1 SNPs. Moreover,
HLA-A*02:06 with TLR3 polymorphisms and HLA-A*02:06 with EP3 polymorphisms
exerted additive effects in SJS/TEN with SOCs. EP3 is strongly downregulated in
the conjunctival epithelium of SJS/TEN. Cold medicines including nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, which are the main causative drugs for SJS/TEN with SOCs,
downregulate the production of prostanoids, including PGE2. Because the PGE2-EP3 
pathway suppresses the inflammation of the ocular surface, skin, and respiratory 
tract, downregulation of PGE2 by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or
acetaminophen might significantly contribute to the onset of CM-SJS/TEN with
SOCs. Cold medicines and infectious agents such as viruses or other microbes are 
both important in triggering the onset of SJS/TEN with SOCs.

BACKGROUND: Specific genes, such as BCAT1 and IKZF1, are methylated with high
frequency in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue compared to normal colon tissue
specimens. Such DNA may leak into blood and be present as cell-free circulating
DNA. We have evaluated the accuracy of a novel blood test for these two markers
across the spectrum of benign and neoplastic conditions encountered in the colon 
and rectum.
METHODS: Circulating DNA was extracted from plasma obtained from volunteers
scheduled for colonoscopy for any reason, or for colonic surgery, at Australian
and Dutch hospitals. The extracted DNA was bisulphite converted and analysed by
methylation specific real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). A specimen was deemed
positive if one or more qPCR replicates were positive for either methylated BCAT1
or IKZF1 DNA. Sensitivity and specificity for CRC were estimated as the primary
outcome measures.
RESULTS: Plasma samples were collected from 2105 enrolled volunteers (mean age 62
years, 54 % male), including 26 additional samples taken after surgical removal
of cancers. The two-marker blood test was run successfully on 2127 samples. The
test identified 85 of 129 CRC cases (sensitivity of 66 %, 95 % CI: 57-74). For
CRC stages I-IV, respective positivity rates were 38 % (95 % CI: 21-58), 69 % (95
% CI: 53-82), 73 % (95 % CI: 56-85) and 94 % (95 % CI: 70-100). A positive trend 
was observed between positivity rate and degree of invasiveness. The colonic
location of cancer did not influence assay positivity rates. Gender, age, smoking
and family history were not significant predictors of marker positivity. Twelve
methylation-positive cancer cases with paired pre- and post-surgery plasma showed
reduction in methylation signal after surgery, with complete disappearance of
signal in 10 subjects. Sensitivity for advanced adenoma (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>338) was 6 % (95 %
CI: 4-9). Specificity was 94 % (95 % CI: 92-95) in all 838 non-neoplastic
pathology cases and 95 % (95 % CI: 92-97) in those with no colonic pathology
detected (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>450).
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity for cancer of this two-marker blood test justifies
prospective evaluation in a true screening population relative to a proven
screening test. Given the high rate of marker disappearance after cancer
resection, this blood test might also be useful to monitor tumour recurrence.

The novel mechanism of lenalidomide activity.

Fink EC(1), Ebert BL(1).

Author information: 
(1)Brigham and Women's Hospital, Division of Hematology, Boston, MA.

Lenalidomide acts by a novel drug mechanism-modulation of the substrate
specificity of the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase. In multiple myeloma,
lenalidomide induces the ubiquitination of IKZF1 and IKZF3 by CRL4(CRBN).
Subsequent proteasomal degradation of these transcription factors kills multiple 
myeloma cells. In del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome, lenalidomide induces the
degradation of CK1a, which preferentially affects del(5q) cells because they
express this gene at haploinsufficient levels. In the future, modulation of
ubiquitin ligase function may enable us to target previously "undruggable"
proteins.

Recent discoveries suggest that the critical events leading to the
anti-proliferative activity of the IMiD immunomodulatory agents lenalidomide and 
pomalidomide in multiple myeloma (MM) cells are initiated by Cereblon-dependent
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of substrate proteins Ikaros (IKZF1)
and Aiolos (IKZF3). By performing kinetic analyses, we found that the
downregulation or proteasomal degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos led to specific
and sequential downregulation of c-Myc followed by IRF4 and subsequent growth
inhibition and apoptosis. Notably, to ensure growth inhibition and cell death,
sustained downregulation of Ikaros and Aiolos, c-Myc or IRF4 expression was
required. In addition, we found that the half-maximal rate, rather than the final
extent of Ikaros and Aiolos degradation, correlated to the relative efficacy of
growth inhibition by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Finally, we observed that all 
four transcription factors were elevated in primary MM samples compared with
normal plasma cells. Taken together, our results suggest a functional link
between Ikaros and Aiolos, and the pathological dysregulation of c-Myc and IRF4, 
and provide a new mechanistic understanding of the relative efficacy of
lenalidomide and pomalidomide based on the kinetics of substrate degradation and 
downregulation of their downstream targets.

Activating tyrosine kinase mutations or cytokine receptor signalling alterations 
have attracted attention as therapeutic targets for high-risk paediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We identified two novel kinase fusions, OFD1-JAK2 
and NCOR1-LYN, in paediatric ALL patients with IKZF1 deletion, by mRNA
sequencing. The patient with CSF2RA-CRLF2 also harboured IGH-EPOR. All these
patients had high-risk features, such as high initial white blood cell counts and
initial poor response to prednisolone. The functional analysis of these novel
fusions is on-going to determine whether these genetic alterations can be
targeted by drugs.

Genome-wide analysis of thymic lymphomas from Tp53(-/-) mice with wild-type or
C-terminally truncated Rag2 revealed numerous off-target, RAG-mediated DNA
rearrangements. A significantly higher fraction of these errors mutated known and
suspected oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes than did sporadic rearrangements (p < 
0.0001). This tractable mouse model recapitulates recent findings in human pre-B 
ALL and allows comparison of wild-type and mutant RAG2. Recurrent, RAG-mediated
deletions affected Notch1, Pten, Ikzf1, Jak1, Phlda1, Trat1, and Agpat9. Rag2
truncation substantially increased the frequency of off-target V(D)J
recombination. The data suggest that interactions between Rag2 and a specific
chromatin modification, H3K4me3, support V(D)J recombination fidelity. Oncogenic 
effects of off-target rearrangements created by this highly regulated recombinase
may need to be considered in design of site-specific nucleases engineered for
genome modification.

Distinct and overlapping functions of the cullin E3 ligase scaffolding proteins
CUL4A and CUL4B.

The cullin 4 subfamily of genes includes CUL4A and CUL4B, which share a mostly
identical amino acid sequence aside from the elongated N-terminal region in
CUL4B. Both act as scaffolding proteins for modular cullin RING ligase 4 (CRL4)
complexes which promote the ubiquitination of a variety of substrates. CRL4
function is vital to cells as loss of both genes or their shared substrate
adaptor protein DDB1 halts proliferation and eventually leads to cell death. Due 
to their high structural similarity, CUL4A and CUL4B share a substantial overlap 
in function. However, in some cases, differences in subcellular localization,
spatiotemporal expression patterns and stress-inducibility preclude functional
compensation. In this review, we highlight the most essential functions of the
CUL4 genes in: DNA repair and replication, chromatin-remodeling, cell cycle
regulation, embryogenesis, hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis. CUL4 genes are also
clinically relevant as dysregulation can contribute to the onset of cancer and
CRL4 complexes are often hijacked by certain viruses to promote viral replication
and survival. Also, mutations in CUL4B have been implicated in a subset of
patients suffering from syndromic X-linked intellectual disability (AKA mental
retardation). Interestingly, the antitumor effects of immunomodulatory drugs are 
caused by their binding to the CRL4CRBN complex and re-directing the E3 ligase
towards the Ikaros transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3. Because of their
influence over key cellular functions and relevance to human disease, CRL4s are
considered promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

Alterations of IKZF1, encoding the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, are a
hallmark of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however the role of
IKZF1 alterations in ALL pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that in
mouse models of BCR-ABL1 leukemia, Ikzf1 and Arf alterations synergistically
promote the development of an aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Ikzf1 alterations
result in acquisition of stem cell-like features, including self-renewal and
increased bone marrow stromal adhesion. Retinoid receptor agonists reversed this 
phenotype, partly by inducing expression of IKZF1, resulting in abrogation of
adhesion and self-renewal, cell cycle arrest, and attenuation of proliferation
without direct cytotoxicity. Retinoids potentiated the activity of dasatinib in
mouse and human BCR-ABL1 ALL, providing an additional therapeutic option in
IKZF1-mutated ALL.

The Ikaros - a DNA-binding zinc finger protein, acting as a regulator of
chromatin remodeling and gene transcription, is crucial for regulating the
development and function of the immune system and acting as a master regulator of
hematopoietic differentiation. Function-loss mutations of IKZF1, gene encoding
Ikaros are frequent in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and are
associated with a poor prognosis. This review briefly summarizes the available
data regarding the structure and function of Ikaros, the role of Ikaros as a
tumor suppressor in B-ALL, and its regulation mechanism.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been the first human malignancy to be
associated, more than 50 years ago, with a consistent chromosomal
abnormality--the t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation. The resulting
BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, encoding a tyrosine kinase with deregulated activity, has a
central role in the pathogenesis of CML. Ancestral or additional genetic events
necessary for CML to develop have long been hypothesized but never really
demonstrated. CML can successfully be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). Mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain might arise, however, that confer
resistance to 1 or more of the currently available TKIs. Hence, the critical role
of BCR-ABL1 mutation screening for optimal therapeutic management, with the
current gold standard technique, conventional sequencing, likely to be replaced
soon by ultra-deep sequencing. Mutations in genes other than BCR-ABL1 include
ASXL1, TET2, RUNX1, DNMT3A, EZH2, and TP53 in chronic phase patients and RUNX1,
ASXL1, IKZF1, WT1, TET2, NPM1, IDH1, IDH2, NRAS, KRAS, CBL, TP53, CDKN2A, RB1,
and GATA-2 mutations in advanced phase patients. The latter also display
additional cytogenetic abnormalities, including submicroscopic regions of gain or
loss that only single nucleotide polymorphism arrays or array comparative genomic
hybridization can detect. Whether whole genome/exome sequencing studies will
uncover novel mutations relevant for pathogenesis, progression, and risk-adapted 
therapy is still unclear.

Copy number alterations (CNAs) in genes committed to B-cell precursors have been 
associated with poor survival in subgroups of patients with B-cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We investigated submicroscopic
alterations in a series of 274 Brazilian children with BCP-ALL by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification and evaluated their correlation with
clinical and laboratory features. The relevance of overlapping CNA abnormalities 
was also explored. Deletions/amplifications in at least one gene were identified 
in 83% of the total series. In children older than 2 years, there was a
predominance of CNAs involving deletions in IKZF1, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B, whereas
the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) had deletions that were found more frequently
in infants (P<U+2009><0.05). Based on the cytogenetic subgroups, favorable cytogenetic
subgroups showed more deletions than other subgroups that occurred
simultaneously, specifically ETV6 deletions (P<U+2009><0.05). TCF3-PBX1 was frequently
deleted in RB1, and an absence of deletions was observed in IKZF1 and genes
localized to the PAR1 region. The results corroborate with previous genome-wide
studies and aggregate new markers for risk stratification of BCP-ALL in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: IKZF1 deletions are an unfavorable prognostic factor in children with
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) as well as negative (Ph(-)) acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although IKZF1 deletions occur in 10-15% of Ph(-)
ALL cases, effects of IKZF1 deletions on signaling pathways in this group have
not been extensively studied. Therefore, in this study we aimed to study the
effect of IKZF1 deletions on active signal transduction pathways.
METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to
determine IKZF1 deletions and other copy number alterations in 109 pediatric
B-Cell Precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. Kinase activity profiling of 45 primary 
Ph(-) BCP-ALL patients (31 IKZF1 wild type patients and 14 patients harboring an 
IKZF1 alteration) and western blot analysis of 14 pediatric BCP-ALL samples was
performed to determine active signal transduction pathways.
RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of kinome profiles of 45
pediatric Ph(-) ALL cases showed no clustering based on IKZF1 status. Comparing
the phosphorylation intensities of peptides associated with signaling pathways
known to be involved in BCP-ALL maintenance, we did not observe differences
between the two groups. Western blot analysis of 14 pediatric BCP-ALL samples
showed large variations in phosphorylation levels between the different ALL
samples, independent of IKZF1 status.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results we conclude that, although IKZF1 deletions
appear to be an important clinical prognostic factor, we were unable to identify 
a unique IKZF1 dependent protein expression signature in pediatric Ph(-) ALL and 
consequently no specific targets for future therapy of Ph(-) IKZF1 deleted
BCP-ALL could be identified.

Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have potent anti-tumor activities in multiple
myeloma (MM) and are able to enhance the cytotoxic function of natural killer
(NK) cells, important effectors of the immune response against MM. Here, we show 
that these drugs can enhance the expression of the NKG2D and DNAM-1 activating
receptor ligands MICA and PVR/CD155 in human MM cell lines and primary malignant 
plasma cells. Depletion of cereblon (CRBN) by shRNA interference strongly
impaired upregulation of these ligands and, more interestingly,
IMiDs/CRBN-mediated downregulation of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1),
Aiolos (IKZF3) and IRF4 was critical for these regulatory mechanisms. Indeed,
shRNA knockdown of IKZF1 or IKZF3 expression was both necessary and sufficient
for the upregulation of MICA and PVR/CD155 expression, suggesting that these
transcription factors can repress these genes; accordingly, the direct
interaction and the negative role of IKZF1 and IKZF3 proteins on MICA and
PVR/CD155 promoters were demonstrated. Finally, MICA expression was enhanced in
IRF4-silenced cells, indicating a specific suppressive role of this transcription
factor on MICA gene expression in MM cells.Taken together, these findings
describe novel molecular pathways involved in the regulation of MICA and
PVR/CD155 gene expression and identify the transcription factors IKZF-1/IKZF-3
and IRF4 as repressors of these genes in MM cells.

Ikaros (IKZF1) is a tumor suppressor that binds DNA and regulates expression of
its target genes. The mechanism of Ikaros activity as a tumor suppressor and the 
regulation of Ikaros function in leukemia are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that 
Ikaros controls cellular proliferation by repressing expression of genes that
promote cell cycle progression and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
pathway. We show that Ikaros function is impaired by the pro-oncogenic casein
kinase II (CK2), and that CK2 is overexpressed in leukemia. CK2 inhibition
restores Ikaros function as transcriptional repressor of cell cycle and PI3K
pathway genes, resulting in an antileukemia effect. In high-risk leukemia where
one IKZF1 allele has been deleted, CK2 inhibition restores the transcriptional
repressor function of the remaining wild-type IKZF1 allele. CK2 inhibition
demonstrated a potent therapeutic effect in a panel of patient-derived primary
high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts as indicated by
prolonged survival and a reduction of leukemia burden. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a novel therapeutic approach for high-risk leukemia: restoration of
Ikaros tumor suppressor activity via inhibition of CK2. These results provide a
rationale for the use of CK2 inhibitors in clinical trials for high-risk
leukemia, including cases with deletion of one IKZF1 allele.

Deletions in IKZF1 are found in ~15% of children with B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). There is strong evidence for the poor prognosis
of IKZF1 deletions affecting exons 4-7 and exons 1-8, but evidence for the
remaining 33% of cases harboring other variants of IKZF1 deletions is lacking. In
an international multicenter study we analyzed the prognostic value of these rare
variants in a case-control design. Each IKZF1-deleted case was matched to three
IKZF1 wild-type controls based on cytogenetic subtype, treatment protocol, risk
stratification arm, white blood cell count and age. Hazard ratios for the
prognostic impact of rare IKZF1 deletions on event-free survival were calculated 
by matched pair Cox regression. Matched pair analysis for all 134 cases with rare
IKZF1 deletions together revealed a poor prognosis (P<0.001) that was evident in 
each risk stratification arm. Rare variant types with the most unfavorable
event-free survival were DEL 2-7 (P=0.03), DEL 2-8 (P=0.002) and DEL-Other
(P<0.001). The prognosis of each type of rare variant was equal or worse compared
with the well-known major DEL 4-7 and DEL 1-8 IKZF1 deletion variants. We
therefore conclude that all variants of rare IKZF1 deletions are associated with 
an unfavorable prognosis in pediatric BCP-ALL.

OBJECTIVE: Glycans attached to the Fc portion of IgG are important modulators of 
IgG effector functions. Interindividual differences in IgG glycome composition
are large and they associate strongly with different inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases. IKZF1, HLA-DQ2A/B, and BACH2 genetic loci that affect IgG glycome
composition show pleiotropy with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), indicating a
potentially causative role of aberrant IgG glycosylation in SLE. We undertook
this large multicenter case-control study to determine whether SLE is associated 
with altered IgG glycosylation.
METHODS: Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis of released
glycans, we analyzed the composition of the IgG glycome in 261 SLE patients and
247 matched controls of Latin American Mestizo origin (the discovery cohort) and 
in 2 independent replication cohorts of different ethnicity (108 SLE patients and
193 controls from Trinidad, and 106 SLE patients and 105 controls from China).
RESULTS: Multiple statistically significant differences in IgG glycome
composition were observed between patients and controls. The most significant
changes included decreased galactosylation and sialylation of IgG (which regulate
proinflammatory and antiinflammatory actions of IgG) as well as decreased core
fucose and increased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (which affect
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity).
CONCLUSION: The IgG glycome in SLE patients is significantly altered in a way
that decreases immunosuppressive action of circulating immunoglobulins. The
magnitude of observed changes is associated with the intensity of the disease,
indicating that aberrant IgG glycome composition or changes in IgG glycosylation 
may be an important molecular mechanism in SLE.

BACKGROUND: Some copy number alterations (CNAs) have independent prognostic
significance for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: This study analyzed via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
the frequency and prognostic impact of CNAs of 12 genetic regions in 142
adolescents and adults with de novo precursor B-cell ALL.
RESULTS: The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) deletion (59 of
142 or 42%) was the most frequent CNA, and it was followed by Ikaros family zinc 
finger 1 (IKZF1) losses (49 of 142 or 35%). IKZF1 deletions were more prevalent
in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL and were associated with advanced
age and high white blood cell (WBC) counts. The multivariate analysis showed that
advanced age and early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) deletions were associated with
chemotherapy resistance in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 0.949 and 0.135,
respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 0.946 and 0.118,
respectively). High WBC counts and focal IKZF1 deletions correlated with disease 
recurrence (hazard ratios, 1.005 and 1.869, respectively), whereas advanced age
and CDKN2A/B losses influenced overall survival in both the whole series (hazard 
ratios, 1.038 and 2.545, respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard
ratios, 1.044 and 2.105, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Deletions of EBF1, IKZF1, and CDKN2A/B have an independent adverse
prognosis for adolescents and adults with B-precursor ALL, and this suggests that
these CNAs should be included in the initial risk assessment of ALL.

20% of children suffering from high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia
develop recurrent disease. The molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we
analyzed the genetic landscape of five patients at relapse, who developed
recurrent disease without prior high-risk indication using whole-exome- and
whole-genome-sequencing. Oncogenic mutations of RAS pathway genes (NRAS, KRAS,
FLT3, n=4) and deactivating mutations of major epigenetic regulators (CREBBP,
EP300, each n=2 and ARID4B, EZH2, MACROD2, MLL2, each n=1) were prominent in
these cases and virtually absent in non-recurrent cases (n=6) or other pediatric 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (n=18). In relapse nucleotide variations were 
detected in cell fate determining transcription factors (GLIS1, AKNA). Structural
genomic alterations affected genes regulating B-cell development (IKZF1, PBX1,
RUNX1). Eleven novel translocations involved the genes ART4, C12orf60, MACROD2,
TBL1XR1, LRRN4, KIAA1467, and ELMO1/MIR1200. Typically, patients harbored only
single structural variations, except for one patient who displayed massive
rearrangements in the context of a germline tumor suppressor TP53 mutation and a 
Li-Fraumeni syndrome-like family history. Another patient harbored a germline
mutation in the DNA repair factor ATM. In summary, the relapse patients of our
cohort were characterized by somatic mutations affecting the RAS pathway,
epigenetic and developmental programs and germline mutations in DNA repair
pathways.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the breakpoint cluster region 
(BCR)-Abelson murine leukemia (ABL1) fusion gene. In approximately 1% of CML
cases, the Philadelphia chromosome associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is
not present, and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is generated by cryptic insertion or
sequential translocations. In this study, we describe the cytogenetic and
molecular features of five CML patients with cryptic BCR-ABL1 fusion genes using 
karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and whole genome single
nucleotide polymorphism array techniques. Two cases of CML in the chronic phase
(CP) had a normal karyotype, and three cases of CML in the blast phase (BP) had
an abnormal karyotype with neither a typical nor variant t(9;22). By BCR-ABL1
metaphase FISH analysis, we found that fusion signals were localized on
chromosomes 9 (3 cases), 22 (1 case), and both 9 and 22 (1 case). In two cases of
CML-BP, duplication of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene occurred as a result of mitotic
recombination between homologous chromosomes. Copy number losses involving the
IKZF1 gene were observed in two patients with CML-BP. This study demonstrates for
the first time the acquisition of additional BCR-ABL1 fusion genes through
mitotic recombination in CML with cryptic BCR-ABL1.

Immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide
exhibit high responsive rates for newly identified or relapsed multiple myeloma
patients. However, their mechanisms of action are not completely understood. One 
mechanism involves the ubiquitination and degradation of two transcription
factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3. Whether there are other degradation pathways for IKZF1 
in myeloma cells remains unknown. Here, we found that although IKZF1
ubiquitination was reduced, its stability was also significantly reduced in MM1.S
and OPM2 cells treated with kinase inhibitors, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside
(DRB) or roscovitine. Through pharmacological inhibition and biochemical
approaches we demonstrated that instead of undergoing the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway, IKZF1 was degraded through apoptosis induced by kinase inhibition. This 
result may provide a new direction in developing therapeutic treatments for
myeloma patients.

Ikaros DNA binding factor plays critical roles in lymphocyte development. Changes
in Ikaros expression levels during lymphopoiesis are controlled by redundant but 
also unique regulatory elements of its locus that are critical for this
developmental process. We have recently shown that Ikaros binds its own locus in 
thymocytes in vivo. Here, we evaluated the role of an Ikaros binding site within 
its major lympho-myeloid promoter. We identified an Ikaros/Ets binding site
within a promoter sub-region that was highly conserved in mouse and human.
Deletion of this binding site increased the percentage of the reporter-expressing
mouse lines, indicating that its loss provided a more permissive chromatin
environment. However, once transcription was established, the lack of this site
decreased transcriptional activity. These findings implicate a dual role for
Ikaros/Ets1 binding on Ikzf1 expression that is exerted at least through its
promoter.

Monitoring mice exposed to carbon ion radiotherapy provides an indirect method to
evaluate the potential for second cancer induction in normal tissues outside the 
radiotherapy target volume, since such estimates are not yet possible from
historical patient data. Here, male and female B6C3F1 mice were given single or
fractionated whole-body exposure(s) to a monoenergetic carbon ion radiotherapy
beam at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan, matching the radiation
quality delivered to the normal tissue ahead of the tumour volume (average linear
energy transfer = 13 keV x µm(-1)) during patient radiotherapy protocols. The
mice were monitored for the remainder of their lifespan, and a large number of T 
cell lymphomas that arose in these mice were analysed alongside those arising
following an equivalent dose of 137Cs gamma ray-irradiation. Using genome-wide
DNA copy number analysis to identify genomic loci involved in radiation-induced
lymphomagenesis and subsequent detailed analysis of Notch1, Ikzf1, Pten, Trp53
and Bcl11b genes, we compared the genetic profile of the carbon ion- and gamma
ray-induced tumours. The canonical set of genes previously associated with
radiation-induced T cell lymphoma was identified in both radiation groups. While 
the pattern of disruption of the various pathways was somewhat different between 
the radiation types, most notably Pten mutation frequency and loss of
heterozygosity flanking Bcl11b, the most striking finding was the observation of 
large interstitial deletions at various sites across the genome in carbon
ion-induced tumours, which were only seen infrequently in the gamma ray-induced
tumours analysed. If such large interstitial chromosomal deletions are a
characteristic lesion of carbon ion irradiation, even when using the low linear
energy transfer radiation to which normal tissues are exposed in radiotherapy
patients, understanding the dose-response and tissue specificity of such DNA
damage could prove key to assessing second cancer risk in carbon ion radiotherapy
patients.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
localized predominantly in body cavities. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes
virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and
has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy.
Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs
display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines
within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1
phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation.
Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed
activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block 
the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved
cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not
IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of
IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic 
readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional
regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the 
BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers
associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC 
transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several
structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore,
combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly
increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft
model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling
evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4
inhibitors for PEL.Oncogene advance online publication, 29 June 2015;

Human CRBN (cereblon) gene is located on chromosome 3 at 3p26 and its encoding
protein is a member of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (composed of CRBN, DDB1, CUL4A
and ROC1). The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome 
protein degradation pathway and attaches polyubiquitin chains to substrate
proteins for degradation via the protease complex. Currently, there are no
standardized assays for CRBN gene and protein measurement although quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry
and Western blot are widely used. CRBN has been identified as a direct target for
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) and plays a significant role in anti-proliferation,
pro-apoptotic effects, anti-angiogenic activities, immunomodulatory activities
and intervention of cell surface adhesion molecules between myeloma cells and
bone marrow stromal cells. Recently, clinical data show that majority of the
multiple myeloma patients treated with IMiD develop drug-resistance over time by 
unknown mechanisms. Fortunately, various in vivo and in vitro studies have
revealed that the decreased CRBN expression or CRBN deletion is associated with
resistance to IMiD in treating multiple myeloma, and CRBN expression levels may
have a prognostic significance. Furthermore, the most recently discovered protein
IKZF1, IKZF3, IRF4, C/EBPß and Wnt/catenin signaling pathways may also be closely
related to IMiD resistance in myeloma.

IKAROS family zinc finger 1/IKZF1 is a transcription factor important in lymphoid
differentiation, and a known tumor suppressor in acute lymphoid leukemia. Recent 
studies suggest that IKZF1 is also involved in myeloid differentiation. To
investigate whether IKZF1 deletions also play a role in pediatric acute myeloid
leukemia, we screened a panel of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia samples for
deletions of the IKZF1 locus using multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification and for mutations using direct sequencing. Three patients were
identified with a single amino acid variant without change of IKZF1 length. No
frame-shift mutations were found. Out of 11 patients with an IKZF1 deletion, 8
samples revealed a complete loss of chromosome 7, and 3 cases a focal deletion of
0.1-0.9Mb. These deletions included the complete IKZF1 gene (n=2) or exons 1-4
(n=1), all leading to a loss of IKZF1 function. Interestingly, differentially
expressed genes in monosomy 7 cases (n=8) when compared to non-deleted samples
(n=247) significantly correlated with gene expression changes in focal
IKZF1-deleted cases (n=3). Genes with increased expression included genes
involved in myeloid cell self-renewal and cell cycle, and a significant portion
of GATA target genes and GATA factors. Together, these results suggest that loss 
of IKZF1 is recurrent in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and might be a
determinant of oncogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7.

The added value of IKZF1 gene deletion (IKZF1(del)) as a stratifying criterion in
B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is still debated. We
performed a comprehensive analysis of the impact of IKZF1(del) in a large cohort 
of children (n=1223) with BCR-ABL1-negative BCP-ALL treated in the EORTC-CLG
trial 58951. Patients with IKZF1(del) had a lower 8-year event-free survival
(EFS, 67.7% versus 86.5%; hazard ratio (HR)=2.41; 95% confidence interval
(CI)=1.75-3.32; P<0.001). Importantly, despite association with high-risk
features such as high minimal residual disease, IKZF1(del) remained significantly
predictive in multivariate analyses. Analysis by genetic subtype showed that
IKZF1(del) increased risk only in the high hyperdiploid ALLs (HR=2.57; 95%
CI=1.19-5.55; P=0.013) and in 'B-other' ALLs, that is, lacking classifying
genetic lesions (HR=2.22; 95% CI=1.45-3.39; P<0.001), the latter having then a
dramatically low 8-year EFS (56.4; 95% CI=44.6-66.7). Among IKZF1(del)-positive
patients randomized for vincristine-steroid pulses during maintenance, those
receiving pulses had a significantly higher 8-year EFS (93.3; 95% CI=61.3-99.0
versus 42.1; 95% CI=20.4-62.5). Thus, IKZF1(del) retains independent prognostic
significance in the context of current risk-adapted protocols, and is associated 
with a dismal outcome in 'B-other' ALL. Addition of vincristine-steroid pulses
during maintenance may specifically benefit to IKZF1(del) patients in preventing 
relapses.

Genetic susceptibility in childhood acute leukaemias: a systematic review.

Acute leukaemias (AL) correspond to 25-35% of all cancer cases in children. The
aetiology is still sheltered, although several factors are implicated in
causality of AL subtypes. Childhood acute leukaemias are associated with genetic 
syndromes (5%) and ionising radiation as risk factors. Somatic genomic
alterations occur during fetal life and are initiating events to childhood
leukaemia. Genetic susceptibility has been explored as a risk factor, since
environmental exposure of the child to xenobiotics, direct or indirectly, can
contribute to the accumulation of somatic mutations. Hence, a systematic review
was conducted in order to understand the association between gene polymorphisms
and childhood leukaemia risk. The search was performed in the electronic
databases PubMed, Lilacs, and Scielo, selecting articles published between 1995
and 2013. This review included 90 case-control publications, which were
classified into four groups: xenobiotic system (n = 50), DNA repair (n = 16),
regulatory genes (n = 15), and genome wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 9). We
observed that the most frequently investigated genes were: NQO1, GSTM1, GSTT1,
GSTP1, CYP1A1, NAT2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, MDR1 (ABCB1), XRCC1, ARID5B, and IKZF1. The 
collected evidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms in CYP2E1, GSTM1, NQO1,
NAT2, MDR1, and XRCC1 are capable of modulating leukaemia risk, mainly when
associated with environmental exposures, such as domestic pesticides and
insecticides, smoking, trihalomethanes, alcohol consumption, and x-rays. More
recently, genome wide association studies identified significant associations
between genetic polymorphisms in ARID5B e IKZF1 and acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia, but only a few studies have replicated these results until now. In
conclusion, genetic susceptibility contributes to the risk of childhood leukaemia
through the effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.

PURPOSE: Discriminant markers for pancreatic cancer detection are needed. We
sought to identify and validate methylated DNA markers for pancreatic cancer
using next-generation sequencing unbiased by known targets.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: At a referral center, we conducted four sequential
case-control studies: discovery, technical validation, biologic validation, and
clinical piloting. Candidate markers were identified using variance-inflated
logistic regression on reduced-representation bisulfite DNA sequencing results
from matched pancreatic cancers, benign pancreas, and normal colon tissues.
Markers were validated technically on replicate discovery study DNA and
biologically on independent, matched, blinded tissues by methylation-specific
PCR. Clinical testing of six methylation candidates and mutant KRAS was performed
on secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice samples from 61 patients with pancreatic 
cancer, 22 with chronic pancreatitis, and 19 with normal pancreas on endoscopic
ultrasound. Areas under receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) for
markers were calculated.
RESULTS: Sequencing identified >500 differentially hyper-methylated regions. On
independent tissues, AUC on 19 selected markers ranged between 0.73 and 0.97.
Pancreatic juice AUC values for CD1D, KCNK12, CLEC11A, NDRG4, IKZF1, PKRCB, and
KRAS were 0.92*, 0.88, 0.85, 0.85, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.75, respectively, for
pancreatic cancer compared with normal pancreas and 0.92*, 0.73, 0.76, 0.85*,
0.73, 0.77, and 0.62 for pancreatic cancer compared with chronic pancreatitis (*,
P = 0.001 vs. KRAS).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified and validated novel DNA methylation markers strongly
associated with pancreatic cancer. On pilot testing in pancreatic juice, best
markers (especially CD1D) highly discriminated pancreatic cases from controls.

Paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (BCP ALL) with IKZF1
deletions (<U+2206>IKZF1) are associated with a poor outcome. However, there are
conflicting data as to whether <U+2206>IKZF1 is an independent risk factor if minimal
residual disease (MRD) and other copy number alterations also are taken into
account. We investigated 334 paediatric BCP ALL, diagnosed 1992-2013 and treated 
according to Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL
protocols, with known IKZF1 status based on either single nucleotide polymorphism
array (N = 218) or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (N = 116)
analyses. <U+2206>IKZF1, found in 15%, was associated with inferior 10-year
probabilities of event-free (60% vs. 83%; P < 0·001) and overall survival (pOS;
73% vs. 89%; P = 0·001). Adjusting for known risk factors, including white blood 
cell (WBC) count and MRD, <U+2206>IKZF1 was the strongest independent factor for relapse
and death. <U+2206>IKZF1 was present in 27% of cases with non-informative cytogenetics
('BCP-other') and a poor 10-year pOS was particularly pronounced in this group
(58% vs. 90%; P < 0·001). Importantly, neither MRD nor WBC count predicted events
in the <U+2206>IKZF1-positive cases. Co-occurrence of pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1)
deletions in Xp22.33/Yp11.32 (P2RY8-CRLF2) and <U+2206>IKZF1 increased the risk of
relapse (75% vs. 30% for cases with only <U+2206>IKZF1; P = 0·045), indicating that
BCP-other ALL with both P2RY8-CRLF2 and <U+2206>IKZF1 constitutes a particularly
high-risk group.

Cancer stem cells can escape therapeutic killing by adopting a quiescent or
dormant state. The reversibility of this condition provides the potential for
later recurrence or relapse, potentially many years later. We describe the
genomics of a rare case of childhood BCR-ABL1-positive, B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia that relapsed, with an acute myeloblastic leukemia
immunophenotype, 22 years after the initial diagnosis, sustained remission and
presumed cure. The primary and relapsed leukemias shared the identical BCR-ABL1
fusion genomic sequence and two identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements,
indicating that the relapse was a derivative of the founding clone. All other
mutational changes (single-nucleotide variant and copy number alterations) were
distinct in diagnostic or relapse samples. These data provide unambiguous
evidence that leukemia-propagating cells, most probably pre-leukemic stem cells, 
can remain covert and silent but potentially reactivatable for more than two
decades.

Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex, is the target of the immunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and
pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of these drugs to CRBN
promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of 2 common substrates,
transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that CC-122, a new
chemical entity termed pleiotropic pathway modifier, binds CRBN and promotes
degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T
cells in vitro, in vivo, and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as
well as immunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced
degradation or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Aiolos and Ikaros
correlates with increased transcription of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes
independent of IFN-a, -ß, and -<U+03B3> production and/or secretion and results in
apoptosis in both activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell DLBCL cell
lines. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the cell-of-origin
independent antilymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrast to the ABC subtype
selective activity of lenalidomide.

B-lymphocyte development in the bone marrow is controlled by the coordinated
action of transcription factors creating regulatory networks ensuring activation 
of the B-lymphoid program and silencing of alternative cell fates. This process
is tightly connected to malignant transformation because B-lineage acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cells display a pronounced block in differentiation
resulting in the expansion of immature progenitor cells. Over the last few years,
high-resolution analysis of genetic changes in leukemia has revealed that several
key regulators of normal B-cell development, including IKZF1, TCF3, EBF1, and
PAX5, are genetically altered in a large portion of the human B-lineage acute
leukemias. This opens the possibility of directly linking the disrupted
development as well as aberrant gene expression patterns in leukemic cells to
molecular functions of defined transcription factors in normal cell
differentiation. This review article focuses on the roles of transcription
factors in early B-cell development and their involvement in the formation of
human leukemia.

Inactivating mutations in IKZF1, the gene that encodes the transcription factor
IKAROS, are recurrent in poor-prognosis human B-cell leukemias, in which these
mutations co-exist with BCR-ABL1 or other genetic changes that activate similar
intracellular signaling pathways. However, little is known about the mechanism(s)
by which loss of IKAROS activity may co-operate with BCR-ABL1 to transform
lymphoid cells. To investigate this question, we used expression of a
dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) to suppress endogenous IKAROS activity 
in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse pro-B BA/F3 cell line and in an
IL-3-independent BCR-ABL1(+) derivative. We then used intracellular phospho-flow 
cytometry to assess the effects of BCR-ABL1 and IK6, alone and in combination, on
the signaling state of the cells before and after their stimulation with IL-3.
BCR-ABL1 and IK6 each produced a constitutively activated signaling phenotype and
also enhanced the signaling responses of BA/F3 cells to IL-3. These effects,
however, were neither equivalent nor additive, and IK6 alone was insufficient to 
confer the IL-3-independent growth characteristic of BCR-ABL1(+) BA/F3 cells. In 
addition to its effects on lymphoid cells, IK6 also induced constitutively
activated signaling in a subset of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Together, these
studies indicate an ability of IK6 to enhance intracellular signaling in both
lymphoid and myeloid cells, but not to synergize with BCR-ABL1 in this model
system.

We have identified a novel SPAG9-JAK2 fusion in a B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(9;17)(p24;q21) and a poor outcome, using
paired-end transcriptome sequencing. Homozygous and hemizygous deletions of
CDKN2A/2B, and hemizygous deletions of PAX5, BTG1, CDK6, ADARB2, and IKZF1 were
also identified by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and single
nucleotide polymorphism array analyses. Having both a tyrosine kinase-activating 
rearrangement and genomic lesions affecting lymphoid transcription factors
suggested that the leukemia was of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)/BCR-ABL1-like
ALL subtype and that JAK2 inhibitors might be able to overcome this aggressive
ALL with SPAG9-JAK2.

IKZF1 gene located in 7p12 of chromosome, and Ikaros family zinc finger encoded
by IKZF1, are lymphoid-restricted transcription factors. In recent years, it has 
been demonstrated that the mutation of IKZF1 gene involved in proliferation,
metastasis and prognosis of many malignant tumor except acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, and also involved in complex phenotypes and susceptibility to systemic 
lupus erythematosus. This review briefly introduces the molecular structure and
physiological function of Ikaros, focusing on its function and molecular
mechanism in proliferation, metastasis and prognosis of malignant tumors, and its
role in the systemic lupus erythematosus.

BACKGROUND: Specific genes are methylated with high frequency in colorectal
neoplasia, and may leak into blood. Detection of multiple methylated DNA
biomarkers in blood may improve assay sensitivity for colorectal cancer (CRC)
relative to a single marker. We undertook a case-control study evaluating the
presence of two methylation DNA markers, BCAT1 and IKZF1, in circulation to
determine if they were complementary for detection of CRC.
METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR assays were developed to measure the level of
methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 in DNA extracted from plasma obtained from
colonoscopy-confirmed 144 healthy controls and 74 CRC cases.
RESULTS: DNA yields ranged from 2 to 730 ng/mL plasma (mean 18.6ng/mL; 95% CI
11-26 ng/mL) and did not correlate with gender, age or CRC status. Methylated
BCAT1 and IKZF1 DNA were detected in respectively 48 (65%) and 50 (68%) of the 74
cancers. In contrast, only 5 (4%) and 7 (5%) controls were positive for BCAT1 and
IKZF1 DNA methylation, respectively. A two-gene classifier model ("either or"
rule) improved segregation of CRC from controls, with 57 of 74 cancers (77%)
compared to only 11 of 144 (7.6%) controls being positive for BCAT1 and/or IKZF1 
DNA methylation. Increasing levels of methylated DNA were observed as CRC stage
progressed.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of methylated BCAT1 and/or IKZF1 DNA in plasma may have
clinical application as a novel blood test for CRC. Combining the results from
the two methylation-specific PCR assays improved CRC detection with minimal
change in specificity. Further validation of this two-gene blood test with a view
to application in screening is now indicated.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) promptly adapt hematopoiesis to stress conditions,
such as infection and cancer, replenishing bone marrow-derived circulating
populations, while preserving the stem cell reservoir. SOCS2, a feedback
inhibitor of JAK-STAT pathways, is expressed in most primitive HSC and is
upregulated in response to STAT5-inducing cytokines. We demonstrate that Socs2
deficiency unleashes HSC proliferation in vitro, sustaining STAT5 phosphorylation
in response to IL3, thrombopoietin, and GM-CSF. In vivo, SOCS2 deficiency leads
to unrestricted myelopoietic response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, in turn,
induces exhaustion of long-term HSC function along serial bone marrow
transplantations. The emerging role of SOCS2 in HSC under stress conditions
prompted the investigation of malignant hematopoiesis. High levels of SOCS2
characterize unfavorable subsets of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias,
such as those with MLL and BCR/ABL abnormalities, and correlate with the
enrichment of genes belonging to hematopoietic and leukemic stemness signatures. 
In this setting, SOCS2 and its correlated genes are part of regulatory networks
fronted by IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C, two transcriptional regulators involved in
normal and leukemic hematopoiesis that have never been linked to SOCS2.
Accordingly, a comparison of murine wt and Socs2(-/-) HSC gene expression in
response to 5-FU revealed a significant overlap with the molecular programs that 
correlate with SOCS2 expression in leukemias, particularly with the oncogenic
pathways and with the IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C-predicted targets. Lentiviral gene
transduction of murine hematopoietic precursors with Mef2c, but not with Ikzf1,
induces Socs2 upregulation, unveiling a direct control exerted by Mef2c over
Socs2 expression.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified that frequent
polymorphisms in ARID5B and IKZF1, two genes involved in lymphoid
differentiation, increase the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). These findings markedly modified the current field of research on the
etiology of ALL. In this new context, the present exploratory study investigated 
the possible interactions between these at-risk alleles and the non-genetic
suspected ALL risk factors that were of sufficient prevalence in the French
ESCALE study: maternal use of home insecticides during pregnancy, preconception
paternal smoking, and some proxies for early immune modulation, i.e.
breastfeeding, history of common infections before age one year, and birth order.
The analyses were based on 434 ALL cases and 442 controls of European origin,
drawn from the nationwide population-based case-control study ESCALE. Information
on non-genetic factors was obtained by standardized telephone interview.
Interactions between rs10740055 in ARID5B or rs4132601 in IKZF1 and each of the
suspected non-genetic factors were tested, with the SNPs coded as counts of minor
alleles (trend variable). Statistical interactions were observed between
rs4132601 and maternal insecticide use (p = 0.012), breastfeeding p = 0.017) and 
repeated early common infections (p = 0.0070), with allelic odds ratios (OR)
which were only increased among the children not exposed to insecticides (OR =
1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.4), those who had been breastfed (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.5)
and those who had had repeated early common infections (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.5,
3.8). The allelic ORs were close to one among children exposed to insecticides,
who had not been breastfed and who had had no or few common infections. Repeated 
early common infections interacted with rs10740055 (p = 0.018) in the case-only
design. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these observations of a
modification of the effect of the at-risk alleles by non-genetic factors are
chance findings or reflect true underlying mechanisms.

There is incomplete understanding of genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution
during cancer progression. Here we use deep whole-exome sequencing to describe
the clonal architecture and evolution of 20 pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic
leukaemias from diagnosis to relapse. We show that clonal diversity is comparable
at diagnosis and relapse and clonal survival from diagnosis to relapse is not
associated with mutation burden. Six pathways were frequently mutated, with
NT5C2, CREBBP, WHSC1, TP53, USH2A, NRAS and IKZF1 mutations enriched at relapse. 
Half of the leukaemias had multiple subclonal mutations in a pathway or gene at
diagnosis, but mostly with only one, usually minor clone, surviving therapy to
acquire additional mutations and become the relapse founder clone.
Relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 were found in nine cases, with mutations in
four cases being in descendants of the relapse founder clone. These results
provide important insights into the genetic basis of treatment failure in ALL and
have implications for the early detection of mutations driving relapse.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies focusing on European-ancestry
populations have identified ALL risk loci on IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. To capture
the impacts of these genes on ALL risk in the California Hispanic population, we 
comprehensively assessed the variation within the genes and further assessed the 
joint effects between the genetic variation and surrogates for early-life
infections (the presence of older siblings, daycare attendance, and ear
infections).
METHODS: Genotypic data for 323 Hispanic ALL cases and 454 controls from the
California Childhood Leukemia Study were generated using Illumina OmniExpress v1 
platform. Logistic regression assuming a log-additive model estimated odds ratios
(OR) associated with each SNP, adjusted for age, sex, and the first five
principal components. In addition, we examined potential interactions between six
ALL risk alleles and surrogates for early-life infections using logistic
regression models that included an interaction term.
RESULTS: Significant associations between genotypes at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE
and ALL risk were identified: rs7780012, OR 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.35-0.71 (p = 0.004); rs7089424, OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.65 (p = 1.16 × 10(-9)); 
rs4982731, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.37-2.08 (p = 2.35 × 10(-6)), respectively. Evidence 
for multiplicative interactions between genetic variants and surrogates for
early-life infections with ALL risk was not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings in non-Hispanic White population, our study
showed that variants within IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE were associated with
increased ALL risk, and the effects for ARID5B and CEBPE were most prominent in
the high-hyperdiploid ALL subtype in the California Hispanic population. Results 
implicate the ARID5B, CEBPE, and IKZF1 genes in the pathogenesis of childhood
ALL.

Ikaros and leukaemia.

University, Lund, Sweden.

The IKZF1 gene at 7p12.2 codes for IKAROS (also termed IKZF1), an essential
transcription factor in haematopoiesis involved primarily in lymphoid
differentiation. Its importance is underlined by the fact that deregulation of
IKAROS results in leukaemia in both mice and men. During recent years,
constitutional as well as acquired genetic changes of IKZF1 have been associated 
with human disease. For example, certain germline single nucleotide polymorphisms
in IKZF1 have been shown to increase the risk of some disorders and abnormal
expression and somatic rearrangements, mutations and deletions of IKZF1 (<U+0394>IKZF1) 
have been detected in a wide variety of human malignancies. Of immediate clinical
importance is the fact that <U+0394>IKZF1 occurs in 15% of paediatric B-cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP ALL) and that the presence of <U+0394>IKZF1 is
associated with an increased risk of relapse and a poor outcome; in some studies 
such deletions have been shown to be an independent risk factor also when minimal
residual disease data are taken into account. However, cooperative genetic
changes, such as ERG deletions and CRLF2 rearrangements, may modify the
prognostic impact of <U+0394>IKZF1, for better or worse. This review summarizes our
current knowledge of IKZF1 abnormalities in human disease, with an emphasis on
BCP ALL.

In contrast to IKZF1 deletions (<U+0394>IKZF1), IKZF1 sequence mutations (mutIKZF1) have
been reported to be rare in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
their clinical implications are unknown. We performed targeted deep sequencing of
all exons of IKZF1 in 140 pediatric cases, eight (5.7%) of which harbored a
mutIKZF1. The probabilities of relapse (pRel) and event-free survival (pEFS) did 
not differ between cases with or without mutIKZF1, whereas pEFS was decreased and
pRel increased in <U+0394>IKZF1-positive case. Coexisting microdeletions, mutations
(FLT3, JAK2, SH2B3, and SPRED1), and rearrangements (ABL1, CRLF2, JAK2, and
PDGFRB) in 35 <U+0394>IKZF1 and/or mutIKZF1-positive cases were ascertained using
fluorescence in situ hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism array, Sanger,
and targeted deep sequencing analyses. The overall frequencies of copy number
alterations did not differ between cases with our without <U+0394>IKZF1/mutIKZF1.
Deletions of HIST1, SH2B3, and the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1), associated with
deregulation of CRLF2, were more common in <U+0394>IKZF1-positive cases, whereas PAR1
deletions and JAK2 mutations were overrepresented in the combined <U+0394>IKZF1/mutIKZF1
group. There was no significant impact on pRel of the deletions in
<U+0394>IKZF1-positive cases or of JAK2 mutations in cases with <U+0394>IKZF1/mutIKZF1. In
contrast, the pRel was higher (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005) in <U+0394>IKZF1/mutIKZF1-positive cases with 
PAR1 deletions.

Autoimmune risk loci of IL12RB2, IKZF1, XKR6, TMEM39A and CSK in Chinese patients
with systemic lupus erythematosus.

University, Chongqing, P.R. China.

Recent genome-wide or follow-up studies conducted in European or Caucasian
populations have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring
increased risk to autoimmune diseases. It is unclear whether these observations
can apply to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in China. An association study
was performed on 395 SLE patients and 378 healthy controls recruited from the
Chinese population, in which the IL12RB2 rs3790567, IKZF1 rs2366293, XKR6
rs4240671, TMEM39A rs1132200 and CSK rs34933034 polymorphisms were examined by
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. The frequency 
of the A allele of IL12RB2 rs3790567 was lower in the cases compared with the
controls (24.8% vs 30.2%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018) and significant difference among the AA, AG 
and GG genotypes of rs3790567 was detected between the SLE patients and healthy
controls (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020). We also found a statistically significant difference in the
dominant model (GG+AG vs AA, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.008). There was no correlation between the
genotypes and specific sub-phenotypes in the current cohort. Associations with
IKZF1 rs2366293, XKR6 rs4240671, TMEM39A rs1132200 and CSK rs34933034 were also
lacking (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). The results supported the theory that IL12RB2 is associated
with SLE in the Chinese population.

Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by a high frequency of 
abnormal karyotypes some of which are related to outcome. Single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) array analysis provides a highly sensitive platform to detect 
large and small genomic aberrations. SNP array profiling data in adult ALL are
limited and further systematic studies of this patient group are needed. We
performed a population-based SNP array analysis of genomic aberrations and their 
influence on survival in 66 Lithuanian 18-65 year old ALL patients diagnosed
between 2007 and 2013. Most aberrations were detected in chromosome arm 9p,
chromosome arm 6q, chromosome arm 13q, and chromosome 17. The recurrently
targeted copy number abnormalities involved several leukemia-related
genes-CDKN2A/B, MLL, IKZF1, PAX5, RB1, TP53, and ETV6. We identified several new 
recurrent aberrations with possible new target genes: SMARCA4 in 19p13.2, RNASEL 
in 1q25.3, ARHGEF12 in 11q23.3, and LYL1 in 19p13.2. Aberrations in chromosome 13
and the RB1 gene as well as CDKN2A/B gene status were related to the outcome.

It is well documented that among subgroups of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(B-ALL), the genetic profile of the leukemic blasts has significant impact on
prognosis and stratification for therapy. Recent studies have documented the
power of microarrays to screen genome-wide for copy number aberrations (CNAs) and
regions of copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) that are not
detectable by G-banding or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These
studies have involved application of a single array platform for the respective
cases. The present investigation demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of
integrating array results from multiple laboratories (ARUP, The Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and
University of Minnesota Medical Center) that utilize different array platforms
(Affymetrix, Agilent, or Illumina) in their respective clinical settings. A total
of 65 patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) study AALL08B1
were identified for study, as cytogenetic and FISH studies had also been
performed on these patients, with a central review of those results available for
comparison. Microarray data were first analyzed by the individual laboratories
with their respective software systems; raw data files were then centrally
validated using NEXUS software. The results demonstrated the added value of
integrating multi-platform data with cytogenetic and FISH data and highlight
novel findings identified by array including the co-occurrence of low and high
risk abnormalities not previously reported to coexist within a clone, novel
regions of chromosomal amplification, clones characterized by numerous whole
chromosome LOH that do not meet criteria for doubling of a near-haploid, and
characterization of array profiles associated with an IKZF1 deletion. Each of
these findings raises questions that are clinically relevant to risk
stratification.

BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and its severe form, toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN), are acute inflammatory vesiculobullous reactions of the skin
and mucous membranes, including the ocular surface, oral cavity, and genitals.
These reactions are very rare but are often associated with inciting drugs,
infectious agents, or both.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify susceptibility loci for cold medicine-related
SJS/TEN (CM-SJS/TEN) with severe mucosal involvement (SMI).
METHODS: A genome-wide association study was performed in 808 Japanese subjects
(117 patients with CM-SJS/TEN with SMI and 691 healthy control subjects), and
subsequent replication studies were performed in 204 other Japanese subjects (16 
cases and 188 control subjects), 117 Korean subjects (27 cases and 90 control
subjects), 76 Indian subjects (20 cases and 56 control subjects), and 174
Brazilian subjects (39 cases and 135 control subjects).
RESULTS: In addition to the most significant susceptibility region, HLA-A, we
identified IKZF1, which encodes Ikaros, as a novel susceptibility gene
(meta-analysis, rs4917014 [G vs. T]; odds ratio, 0.5; P = 8.5 × 10(-11)).
Furthermore, quantitative ratios of the IKZF1 alternative splicing isoforms Ik1
and Ik2 were significantly associated with rs4917014 genotypes.
CONCLUSION: We identified IKZF1 as a susceptibility gene for CM-SJS/TEN with SMI 
not only in Japanese subjects but also in Korean and Indian subjects and showed
that the Ik2/Ik1 ratio might be influenced by IKZF1 single nucleotide
polymorphisms, which were significantly associated with susceptibility to
CM-SJS/TEN with SMI.

AIM: To identify risk alleles contributing towards type 1 diabetes in Pakistani
patients.
INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease which is caused by
destruction of insulin producing ß cells by immune system. Genetic predisposition
as well as environmental factors contribute to its etiology. To date more than 40
risk loci have been identified for T1D.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 191 family-based and unrelated T1D cases and controls
were recruited. DNA was extracted and 32 genome-wide significant single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported in Europeans were genotyped. 
Genotyping was performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays and the data was
analyzed using FamCC software.
RESULTS: Our results showed significant association of 10 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with T1D at p<0.01, including HLA-DQA1/rs9272346,
ERBB3/rs2292239, SIRPG/rs2281808, IL2-KIAA1109/rs4505848, GLIS3/rs7020673,
CD226/rs763361, PTPN2/rs478582, IKZF1/rs10272724, BACH2/rs11755527,
C6orf173/rs9388489, whereas 5 more SNPs showed their association at 0.01<p<0.05
in Pakistani population.
CONCLUSION: We have replicated many of the T1D loci established among Europeans
in a Pakistani population.

Activating NOTCH1 mutations occur in ~60% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemias (T-ALLs), and mutations disrupting the transcription factor IKZF1
(IKAROS) occur in ~5% of cases. To investigate the regulatory interplay between
these driver genes, we have used a novel transgenic RNA interference mouse model 
to produce primary T-ALLs driven by reversible Ikaros knockdown. Restoring
endogenous Ikaros expression in established T-ALL in vivo acutely represses
Notch1 and its oncogenic target genes including Myc, and in multiple primary
leukemias causes disease regression. In contrast, leukemias expressing high
levels of endogenous or engineered forms of activated intracellular Notch1 (ICN1)
resembling those found in human T-ALL rapidly relapse following Ikaros
restoration, indicating that ICN1 functionally antagonizes Ikaros in established 
disease. Furthermore, we find that IKAROS mRNA expression is significantly
reduced in a cohort of primary human T-ALL patient samples with activating
NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations, but is upregulated upon acute inhibition of aberrant
NOTCH signaling across a panel of human T-ALL cell lines. These results
demonstrate for the first time that aberrant NOTCH activity compromises IKAROS
function in mouse and human T-ALL, and provide a potential explanation for the
relative infrequency of IKAROS gene mutations in human T-ALL.

    Neuron. 2015 Feb 4;85(3):447-9.

Neural progenitors alter their output over time to generate different types of
neurons and glia in specific chronological sequences, but this process remains
poorly understood in vertebrates. Here we show that Casz1, the vertebrate
ortholog of the Drosophila temporal identity factor castor, controls the
production of mid-/late-born neurons in the murine retina. Casz1 is expressed
from mid/late stages in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), and conditional deletion
of Casz1 increases production of early-born retinal neurons at the expense of
later-born fates, whereas precocious misexpression of Casz1 has the opposite
effect. In both cases, cell proliferation is unaffected, indicating that Casz1
does not control the timing of cell birth but instead biases RPC output directly.
Just as Drosophila castor lies downstream of the early temporal identity factor
hunchback, we find that the hunchback ortholog Ikzf1 represses Casz1. These
results uncover a conserved strategy regulating temporal identity transitions
from flies to mammals.

Casz1/Castor as a late temporal identity factor in mouse retinal progenitors that

[Thalidomide, cereblon and multiple myeloma].

[Article in Japanese]

Ogura T.

Cereblon was identified as a direct target of thalidomide by Prof. H. Handa, and 
this pioneering work triggered active research on IMiDs (immunomodulatory drugs),
which include thalidomide-derivatives, such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide.
These small molecules have been shown to bind to cereblon (CRBN) to modulate its 
activity as a substrate receptor. In addition, structural analyses on CRBN have
revealed unique actions of these small agents, by which degradation of
transcription factors is controlled in a specific and unique way. I summarize
recent progress on CRBN-CRLA ubiquitin ligase and IMiDs, focusing on the
therapeutic application of these drugs for treatment of multiple myeloma.

Lenalidomide and its analogs, thalidomide and pomalidomide, specifically inhibit 
growth of mature B-cell lymphomas, including multiple myeloma, and induce
interleukin-2 (IL-2) release from T cells. We recently found that this results
from activation of the CRBN-CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade the lymphoid
transcription factors IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos).

Because a pediatric-inspired Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia (GRAALL) protocol yielded a markedly improved outcome in adults with
Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL, we aimed to reassess the role of allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients treated in the GRAALL-2003 and
GRAALL-2005 trials. In all, 522 patients age 15 to 55 years old and presenting
with at least 1 conventional high-risk factor were candidates for SCT in first
complete remission. Among these, 282 (54%) received a transplant in first
complete remission. At 3 years, posttransplant cumulative incidences of relapse, 
nonrelapse mortality, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated at 19.5%,
15.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Time-dependent analysis did not reveal a
significant difference in RFS between SCT and no-SCT cohorts. However, SCT was
associated with longer RFS in patients with postinduction minimal residual
disease (MRD) =10(-3) (hazard ratio, 0.40) but not in good MRD responders. In
B-cell precursor ALL, SCT also benefitted patients with focal IKZF1 gene deletion
(hazard ratio, 0.42). This article shows that poor early MRD response, in
contrast to conventional ALL risk factors, is an excellent tool to identify
patients who may benefit from allogeneic SCT in the context of intensified adult 
ALL therapy. Trial GRAALL-2003 was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as
#NCT00222027; GRAALL-2005 was registered as #NCT00327678.

OBJECTIVE: To explore susceptibility genes associated with yang-deficiency
constitution using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.
METHODS: Based on an epidemiological survey, 30 volunteers with yang-deficiency
constitution and 30 volunteers with a balanced constitution were included
according to the Classification and Determination Standards of Constitutions in
Traditional Chinese Medicine. Peripheral blood was collected and DNA was
extracted from white blood cells. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was
conducted by SNP 6.0 genotyping at the Beijing CapitalBio Corporation Ltd. A
minimum association P-value (Fisher's exact value) of less than 10(-4) in the
allele, genotype, dominant, and recessive models served as the standard for
significant association of SNP with yang-deficiency constitution.
RESULTS: Among the four genetic models, a total of 42 SNPs were significantly
associated with yang-deficiency constitution (Fisher's exact P-values P<10(-4)). 
These SNPs were adjacent to more than 20 genes, including RGS6, mGluR5, GAPDHL19,
and IKZF1.
CONCLUSION: Yang-deficiency constitution exhibits the characteristics of
polygenic inheritance. This pilot study suggests that the polymorphisms in RGS6, 
mGluR5, GAPDHL19, and IKZF1 are associated with changes in cyclic adenosine
monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, memory, metabolic energy
status, and immune function, respectively in people with yang-deficiency
constitution.

EPAS1 involves in the hypoxic response and is suggested to be responsible for the
genetic adaptation of high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans. However, the detailed
molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, a single nucleotide
polymorphism rs56721780:G>C and an insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism -742
indel in the promoter region showed divergence between Tibetans and non-Tibetan
lowlanders. rs56721780:G>C regulated the transcription of EPAS1 by IKAROS family 
zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), which was identified as a new transcriptional repressor
for EPAS1 gene. It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G>C decreased the
binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1
gene. The insertion at -742 indel provided a new binding site for Sp1 and was
related to the activation of EPAS1 promoter. Further functional analysis revealed
that lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene, which was reported to be responsible for
extracellular matrix protein cross-linking of amnion previously, was a direct
target of EPAS1. The CC genotype at rs56721780:G>C and the insertion genotype at 
-742 indel were found associated with higher EPAS1 and LOX expression levels in
amnion, as well as higher birth weight of Tibetan newborns, suggesting that EPAS1
gene might play important roles in the development of amnion, fetus growth and
high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans.

We investigated the prognostic relevance of IKZF1 deletions in 118 adult
Ph-positive ALL patients who had minimal residual disease (MRD) data under a
uniform treatment of allo-SCT following first-line imatinib-based chemotherapy.
IKZF1 deletions were identified in 93 patients (78.8%). IKZF1-deleted patients
had a lower proportion of early-stable molecular responders compared with
wild-type patients (28.0 vs 56.0%, P=0.028). After a median follow-up of 72
months, IKZF1-deleted patients had a trend for higher cumulative incidence of
relapse (CIR) (38.0 vs 13.3%, P=0.052), particularly in a subgroup of
early-stable molecular responders (n=40; 21.4 vs 0%, P=0.088), but comparable
disease-free survival to wild-type patients. Patients with biallelic-null
deletions showed higher CIR (74.6 vs 13.3%, P=0.003) and lower disease-free
survival (20.0 vs 67.5%, P=0.022) than wild-type patients. In multivariate
analysis, MRD kinetics were closely related to outcomes, while neither IKZF1
deletions nor their functional subtypes retained an independent statistical
power. Within the limitation of sample size, however, considering both the
negative impact of IKZF1 deletions on MRD kinetics and a trend for relationship
between IKZF1 deletions and relapse in early-stable molecular responders, IKZF1
deletions may have a potentially additive effect on unfavorable prognosis in a
specific MRD-based subgroup of adult Ph-positive ALL transplants.

Canada; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: Two common polymorphisms in the IKZF1 gene (rs4132601 and rs11978267
variants) have been reported to be associated with childhood acute leukemia (AL) 
risk, however the results were inconsistent. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis
to generate large-scale evidence on whether IKZF1 variants are risk factors for
childhood AL.
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Web of Science were searched up to June
2, 2014 for studies on the association of IKZF1 polymorphisms with childhood AL
risk. Data were extracted and the odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) were calculated by a fixed-effects or random-effects model. Subgroup
analysis by ethnicity and leukemia subtype, sensitivity and cumulative
meta-analyses were performed. Moreover, publication bias was assessed by Begg's
and Egger's tests.
RESULTS: In total, 33 case control studies were finally included in this
meta-analysis. For rs4132601 polymorphism, significantly increased AL risk was
observed in all genetic models (the association was still significant when the p 
value was Bonferroni adjusted to 0.025). In the subgroup analysis by tumor type, 
statistical association was observed in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL).
Additionally, when stratified by ethnicity, significantly increased AL risk was
only observed in European subgroup, but not among African or mixed population
subgroups. Finally, similar results were found for rs11978267 polymorphism.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this meta-analysis provides evidence that rs4132601 and
rs11978267 polymorphisms in the IKZF1 gene might contribute to the occurrence of 
BCP-ALL, especially in European populations. Moreover, further studies with large
sample size are required to clarify possible roles of IKZF1 variants in other
ethnic groups (e.g., Asians and Africans).

BACKGROUND: Various studies have reported that IKZF1 deletion (IKZF1-d) is a poor
prognostic factor for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, however they
do not agree on the level of significance for this deletion.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a quantitative assessment of this correlation, an updated
meta-analysis of cohort studies was performed to derive a more precise estimation
of the prognostic significance of IKZF1-d.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of
Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases
until January 31, 2014. A total of 15 published studies including 5021 patients
were eligible for this meta-analysis. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with random-effects model.
RESULTS: Combined hazard ratios suggested that IKZF1 deletion (IKZF1-d) had an
unfavorable impact on event-free survival (EFS) (HR=2.32, 95%CI: 1.97-2.74) and
overall survival (OS) (HR=2.56, 95%CI: 1.75-3.74) in patients with ALL. The
significant role of IKZF1-d in the prognosis of ALL was also observed among
different subgroups stratified by statistical methodology, ethnicity, age,
detection method, risk group and duration of follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this meta-analysis suggest that IKZF1 deletion can
be used to serve as an independent predictive factor in patients with ALL.

The genetic and transcriptional signature of EVI1 (ecotropic viral integration
site 1)-rearranged (EVI1-r) acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) remains poorly
defined. We performed RNA sequencing of 12 EVI1-r AMLs and compared the results
with those of other AML subtypes (n = 139) and normal CD34(+) cells (n = 17).
Results confirm high frequencies of RAS and other activated signaling mutations
(10/12 AMLs) and identify new recurrent mutations in splicing factors (5/12 AMLs 
in SF3B1 and 2/12 AMLs in U2AF1), IKZF1 (3/12 AMLs), and TP53 (3/12 AMLs).
Mutations in IKZF1, a gene located on chromosome 7, and monosomy 7 are mutually
exclusive in this disease. Moreover IKZF1 expression is halved in monosomy 7
leukemias. EVI-r AMLs are also characterized by a unique transcriptional
signature with high expression levels of MECOM, PREX2, VIP, MYCT1, and PAWR. Our 
results suggest that EVI1-r AMLs could be molecularly defined by specific
transcriptomic anomalies and a hitherto unseen mutational pattern. Larger patient
cohorts will better determine the frequency of these events.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) during early chemotherapy is a powerful predictor 
of relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and is used in children to
determine eligibility for allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) in first (CR1) or later complete remission (CR2/CR3). Variables affecting 
HSCT outcome were analysed in 81 children from the ANZCHOG ALL8 trial. The major 
cause of treatment failure was relapse, with a cumulative incidence of relapse at
5 years (CIR) of 32% and treatment-related mortality of 8%. Leukaemia-free
survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar for HSCT in CR1 (LFS 62%,
OS 83%, n = 41) or CR2/CR3 (LFS 60%, OS 72%, n = 40). Patients achieving bone
marrow MRD negativity pre-HSCT had better outcomes (LFS 83%, OS 92%) than those
with persistent MRD pre-HSCT (LFS 41%, OS 64%, P < 0·0001) or post-HSCT (LFS 35%,
OS 55%, P < 0·0001). Patients with B-other ALL had more relapses (CIR 50%, LFS
41%) than T-ALL and the main precursor-B subtypes including BCR-ABL1, KMT2A
(MLL), ETV6-RUNX1 (TEL-AML1) and hyperdiploidy >50. A Cox multivariate regression
model for LFS retained both B-other ALL subtype (hazard ratio 4·1, P = 0·0062)
and MRD persistence post-HSCT (hazard ratio 3·9, P = 0·0070) as independent
adverse prognostic variables. Persistent MRD could be used to direct post-HSCT
therapy.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have established association of ARID5B and
IKZF1 variants with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epidemiological
studies suggest that environmental factors alone appear to make a relatively
minor contribution to disease risk. The polygenic nature of childhood ALL
predisposition together with the timing of environmental triggers may hold vital 
clues for disease etiology. This study presents results from an Australian GWAS
of childhood ALL cases (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>358) and population controls (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>1192). Furthermore,
we utilised family trio (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>204) genotypes to extend our investigation to
gene-environment interaction of significant loci with parental exposures before
conception, and child's sex and age. Thirteen SNPs achieved genome wide
significance in the population based case/control analysis; ten annotated to
ARID5B and three to IKZF1. The most significant SNPs in these regions were ARID5B
rs4245595 (OR 1.63, CI 1.38-1.93, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.13×10(-9)), and IKZF1 rs1110701 (OR 1.69,
CI 1.42-2.02, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>7.26×10(-9)). There was evidence of gene-environment
interaction for risk genotype at IKZF1, whereby an apparently stronger genetic
effect was observed if the mother took folic acid or if the father did not smoke 
prior to pregnancy (respective interaction P-values: 0.04, 0.05). There were no
interactions of risk genotypes with age or sex (P-values >0.2). Our results
evidence that interaction of genetic variants and environmental exposures may
further alter risk of childhood ALL however, investigation in a larger population
is required. If interaction of folic acid supplementation and IKZF1 variants
holds, it may be useful to quantify folate levels prior to initiating use of
folic acid supplements.

CD133 is a cellular surface glycoprotein that has been reported as a marker for
the enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the regulatory mechanism of 
CD133 remains unknown. CSCs have been proposed to contribute to radioresistance
and multi-drug resistance. The elucidation of key regulators of CD133 and CSCs is
critical for the development of CSC-targeted therapy. In this study, we showed
that Ikarosinhibited the expression of CD133 via direct binding to the CD133 P1
promoter and repressed the tumorigenic and self-renewal capacity of CD133(+)
cancer stem-like cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that Ikaros
interacted with CtBP as a transcription repressor complex, which inhibited CD133 
expression in HCC. We also demonstrated that Ikaros expression was up-regulated
by ETS1 which activity was regulated by MAPKs pathway. Furthermore, decreased
expression of Ikaroswas significantly associated with poor survival in HCC
patients. Overall, our study identifies that Ikaros plays a role as a
transcription repressor in HCC and is a new reactivated therapeutic target for
the treatment of HCC. Meanwhile, our findings provide evidence that Ikaros could 
be an attractive inhibitor of the target gene CD133, which reactivates anticancer
mechanisms in targeted CSC therapy.

In contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, adult cases of this
disease are associated with a very poor prognosis. In order to ascertain whether 
the frequencies and patterns of submicroscopic changes, identifiable with single 
nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, differ between childhood and adult acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism array
analyses of 126 adult cases, the largest series to date, including 18 paired
diagnostic and relapse samples. Apart from identifying characteristic
microdeletions of the CDKN2A, EBF1, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5 and RB1 genes, the present 
study uncovered novel, focal deletions of the BCAT1, BTLA, NR3C1, PIK3AP1 and
SERP2 genes in 2-6% of the adult cases. IKZF1 deletions were associated with
B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P=0.036), BCR-ABL1-positive acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (P<0.001), and higher white blood cell counts (P=0.005).
In addition, recurrent deletions of RASSF3 and TOX were seen in relapse samples. 
Comparing paired diagnostic/relapse samples revealed identical changes at
diagnosis and relapse in 27%, clonal evolution in 22%, and relapses evolving from
ancestral clones in 50%, akin to what has previously been reported in pediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and indicating that the mechanisms of relapse may be
similar in adult and childhood cases. These findings provide novel insights into 
the leukemogenesis of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, showing similarities to
childhood disease in the pattern of deletions and the clonal relationship between
diagnostic and relapse samples, but with the adult cases harboring additional
aberrations that have not been described in pediatric acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.

repression of TdT in thymocytes and T-cell leukemia.

BACKGROUND: Ikaros is a DNA-binding protein that acts as master-regulator of
hematopoiesis and a tumor suppressor. In thymocytes and T-cell leukemia, Ikaros
negatively regulates transcription of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT),
a key protein in lymphocyte differentiation. The signaling pathways that regulate
Ikaros-mediated repression of TdT are unknown. Our previous work identified
Casein Kinase II (CK2) and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) as regulators of Ikaros
DNA binding activity. Here, we investigated the role of PP1 and CK2 in regulating
Ikaros-mediated control of TdT expression.
PROCEDURES: Ikaros phosphomimetic and phosphoresistant mutants and specific CK2
and PP1 inhibitors were used in combination with quantitative chromatin
immunoprecipitation (qChIP) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (q RT-PCR)
assays to evaluate the role of CK2 and PP1 in regulating the ability of Ikaros to
bind the TdT promoter and to regulate TdT expression.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ikaros by pro-oncogenic CK2
decreases Ikaros binding to the promoter of the TdT gene and reduces the ability 
of Ikaros to repress TdT expression during thymocyte differentiation. CK2
inhibition and PP1 activity restore Ikaros DNA-binding affinity toward the TdT
promoter, as well as Ikaros-mediated transcriptional repression of TdT in primary
thymocytes and in leukemia.
CONCLUSION: These data establish that PP1 and CK2 signal transduction pathways
regulate Ikaros-mediated repression of TdT in thymocytes and leukemia. These
findings reveal that PP1 and CK2 have opposing effects on Ikaros-mediated
repression of TdT and establish novel roles for PP1 and CK2 signaling in
thymocyte differentiation and leukemia.

Recombination activating gene-2 (RAG-2) and NWC are strongly evolutionarily
conserved overlapping genes which are convergently transcribed. In non-lymphoid
cells the NWC promoter is active whereas in lymphocytes it is inactive due to the
DNA methylation. Analysing the mechanism responsible for lymphocyte-specific
methylation and inactivation of NWC promoter we found that Ikaros, a
lymphocyte-specific transcription factor, acts as a repressor of NWC
promoter--thus identifying a new Ikaros target--but is insufficient for inducing 
its methylation which depends on the antisense transcription driven by RAG-2
promoter. Possible implications of these observations for understanding
evolutionary mechanisms leading to lymphocyte specific expression of RAG genes
are discussed.

Integrated multi-cohort transcriptional meta-analysis of neurodegenerative
diseases.

Li MD, Burns TC, Morgan AA, Khatri P.

INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases share common pathologic features
including neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation,
suggesting common underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. We undertook a
meta-analysis of public gene expression data for neurodegenerative diseases to
identify a common transcriptional signature of neurodegeneration.
RESULTS: Using 1,270 post-mortem central nervous system tissue samples from 13
patient cohorts covering four neurodegenerative diseases, we identified 243
differentially expressed genes, which were similarly dysregulated in 15
additional patient cohorts of 205 samples including seven neurodegenerative
diseases. This gene signature correlated with histologic disease severity.
Metallothioneins featured prominently among differentially expressed genes, and
functional pathway analysis identified specific convergent themes of
dysregulation. MetaCore network analyses revealed various novel candidate hub
genes (e.g. STAU2). Genes associated with M1-polarized macrophages and reactive
astrocytes were strongly enriched in the meta-analysis data. Evaluation of genes 
enriched in neurons revealed 70 down-regulated genes, over half not previously
associated with neurodegeneration. Comparison with aging brain data (3 patient
cohorts, 221 samples) revealed 53 of these to be unique to neurodegenerative
disease, many of which are strong candidates to be important in neuropathogenesis
(e.g. NDN, NAP1L2). ENCODE ChIP-seq analysis predicted common upstream
transcriptional regulators not associated with normal aging (REST, RBBP5, SIN3A, 
SP2, YY1, ZNF143, IKZF1). Finally, we removed genes common to neurodegeneration
from disease-specific gene signatures, revealing uniquely robust immune response 
and JAK-STAT signaling in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results implicate pervasive bioenergetic deficits, M1-type
microglial activation and gliosis as unifying themes of neurodegeneration, and
identify numerous novel genes associated with neurodegenerative processes.

Associating the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with genetic
predisposition is still a challenge. Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl 
and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL
clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in
complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death
with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1
usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent
outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive
disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial
history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were
absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53,
and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for
IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was
tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions
occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found
in the parents. Altogether, our data suggest that genetic predisposition aligned 
with chance haa an additive effect in BCP-ALL outcome.

The evolving tale of immunomodulatory drugs and cereblon.

Holstein SA(1).

The immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), of which thalidomide was the first in class, 
have had a complex therapeutic history. Although these drugs are now widely used 
to treat multiple myeloma, the precise molecular mechanism of action of these
agents has remained elusive. The finding that IMiDs bind cereblon, with
subsequent activation of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and degradation of the key 
transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3, has provided insight into these drugs but 
leaves many questions unanswered.

The Cul4-Rbx1-DDB1-Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is the target of
thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, therapeutically important drugs for
multiple myeloma and other B-cell malignancies. These drugs directly bind
Cereblon (CRBN) and promote the recruitment of substrates Ikaros (IKZF1) and
Aiolos (IKZF3) to the E3 complex, thus leading to substrate ubiquitination and
degradation. Here we present the crystal structure of human CRBN bound to DDB1
and the drug lenalidomide. A hydrophobic pocket in the thalidomide-binding domain
(TBD) of CRBN accommodates the glutarimide moiety of lenalidomide, whereas the
isoindolinone ring is exposed to solvent. We also solved the structures of the
mouse TBD in the apo state and with thalidomide or pomalidomide. Site-directed
mutagenesis in lentiviral-expression myeloma models showed that key drug-binding 
residues are critical for antiproliferative effects.

Bats comprise 20% of all mammalian species and display a number of
characteristics, including true flight, echolocation, and a heightened ability to
resist viral load that uniquely position this group for comparative genomic
studies. Here we searched for evidence of genomic variation consistent with
sensory rewiring through bat evolution. We focused on two species with divergent 
sensory preferences. Myotis davidii is a bat species that echolocates and
possesses dim- but not daylight-adapted vision whereas the black flying fox
(Pteropus alecto) has highly developed day vision but does not echolocate. Using 
the naked mole rat as a reference, we found five functional genes (CYP1A2, RBP3, 
GUCY2F, CRYBB1, and GRK7) encoding visual proteins that have degenerated into
pseudogenes in M. davidii but not P. alecto. In a second approach genome-wide
codon usage bias (CUB) was compared between the two bat species. This CUB ranking
systematically enriched for vision-related (CLN8, RD3, IKZF1, LAMC3, CRX, SOX8,
VAX2, HPS1, RHO, PRPH2, and SOX9) and hearing-related (TPRN, TMIE, SLC52A3, OTOF,
WFS1, SOD1, TBX18, MAP1A, OTOS, GPX1, and USH1G) machinery in M. davidii but not 
P. alecto. All vision and hearing genes selectively enriched in M. davidii for
which orthologs could be identified also were more biased in the echolocating M. 
lucifugus than the nonecholocating P. vampyrus. We suggest that the existence of 
codon bias in vision- and hearing-related genes in a species that has evolved
echolocation implies CUB is part of evolution's toolkit to rewire sensory
systems. We propose that the two genetic changes (pseudogene formation and CUB)
collectively paint a picture of that incorporates a combination of destruction
and gain-of-function. Together, they help explain how natural selection has
reduced physiological costs associated with the development of a smaller eye
poorly adapted to day vision but that also contribute to enhanced dim light
vision and the hearing adaptations consonant with echolocation.

Ikaros fingers on lymphocyte differentiation.

Yoshida T(1), Georgopoulos K.

The Ikaros family of DNA-binding proteins are critical regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. In multipotent, hematopoietic progenitors, Ikaros supports
transcriptional priming of genes promoting lymphocyte differentiation. Ikaros
targets the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex to lymphoid lineage 
genes, thereby increasing chromatin accessibility and transcriptional priming.
After lymphoid lineage specification, Ikaros expression is raised to levels
characteristic of intermediate B cell and T cell precursors, which is necessary
to support maturation and prevent leukemogenesis. Loss of Ikaros in T cell
precursors allows the NuRD complex to repress lymphocyte genes and extends its
targeting to genes that support growth and proliferation, causing their
activation and triggering a cascade of events that leads to leukemogenesis. Loss 
of Ikaros in B cell precursors blocks differentiation and perpetuates stromal
adhesion by enhancing integrin signaling. The combination of integrin and
cytokine signaling in Ikaros-deficient pre-B cells promotes their survival and
self-renewal. The stages of lymphocyte differentiation that are highly dependent 
on Ikaros are underscored by changes in Ikaros transcription, supported by a
complex network of stage-specific regulatory networks that converge upon the
Ikzf1 locus. It is increasingly apparent that understanding the regulatory
networks that operate upstream and downstream of Ikaros is critical not only for 
our understanding of normal lymphopoiesis, but also in placing the right finger
on the mechanisms that support hematopoietic malignancies in mouse and human.

Roquin-1, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions as a modulator of
inflammation; however, nothing is known about how Rc3h1 expression is regulated. 
Here, we describe an opposing relationship between Roquin-1 and the IL-17
proinflammatory cytokine by demonstrating that enforced expression of Rc3h1
restricts Il17a expression, and that exposure of T cells to IL-10, a cytokine
with immunosuppressive activity, increases Rc3h1 expression. Luciferase reporter 
assays conducted using eight transcription factor plasmids (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, 
GATA2, c-Rel, IKZF1, IKZF2, and IKZF3) demonstrated that STAT1, STAT3, GATA2, and
c-Rel increased Rc3h1 promoter activity, whereas IKZF2 decreased activity. Gene
expression of those five transcription factors increased in T cells exposed to
IL-10. Transcription factor-specific siRNAs suppressed the IL-10 effect on Rc3h1 
transcription. These findings identify a role for IL-10 in regulating Rc3h1
transcription, and they have implications for understanding how Roquin-1 controls
the immune response.

In Western countries, gene alterations involving the CRLF2-JAK signaling pathway 
are identified in approximately 50-60% of patients with Down syndrome-associated 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS-ALL), and this pathway is considered a potential
therapeutic target. The frequency of BTG1 deletions in DS-ALL is controversial.
IKZF1 deletions, found in 20-30% of DS-ALL patients, are associated with a poor
outcome and EBF1 deletions are very rare (~2%). We analyzed 38 patients to
determine the frequencies and clinical implications of CRLF2-JAK pathway genetic 
alterations and recurrent gene deletions in Japanese DS-ALL patients. We
confirmed a high incidence of P2RY8-CRLF2 (29%) and JAK2 mutations (16%), though 
the frequency of P2RY8-CRLF2 was slightly lower than that in Western countries
(~50%). BTG1 deletions were common in our cohort (25%). IKZF1 deletions were
detected in 25% of patients and associated with shorter overall survival (OS).
EBF1 deletions were found at an unexpectedly high frequency (16%), and at a
significantly higher level in P2RY8-CRLF2-positive patients than in
P2RY8-CRLF2-negative patients (44% vs. 4%, P=0.015). Deletions of CDKN2A/B and
PAX5 were common in P2RY8-CRLF2-negative patients (48 and 39%, respectively) but 
not in P2RY8-CRLF2-positive patients (11% each). Associations between these
genetic alterations and clinical characteristics were not observed except for
inferior OS in patients with IKZF1 deletions. These results suggest that
differences exist between the genetic profiles of DS-ALL patients in Japan and in
Western countries, and that P2RY8-CRLF2 and EBF1 deletions may cooperate in
leukemogenesis in a subset of Japanese DS-ALL patients.

In the 1950s, the drug thalidomide, administered as a sedative to pregnant women,
led to the birth of thousands of children with multiple defects. Despite the
teratogenicity of thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and pomalidomide, 
these immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) recently emerged as effective treatments for
multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion-associated dysplasia. IMiDs target the E3
ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)) and promote the
ubiquitination of the IKAROS family transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 by
CRL4(CRBN). Here we present crystal structures of the DDB1-CRBN complex bound to 
thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide. The structure establishes that CRBN
is a substrate receptor within CRL4(CRBN) and enantioselectively binds IMiDs.
Using an unbiased screen, we identified the homeobox transcription factor MEIS2
as an endogenous substrate of CRL4(CRBN). Our studies suggest that IMiDs block
endogenous substrates (MEIS2) from binding to CRL4(CRBN) while the ligase complex
is recruiting IKZF1 or IKZF3 for degradation. This dual activity implies that
small molecules can modulate an E3 ubiquitin ligase and thereby upregulate or
downregulate the ubiquitination of proteins.

Several studies have been conducted to examine the association between IKZF1
rs4132601 polymorphism and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk. However, the 
conclusions remain controversial. We therefore performed a meta-analysis. PubMed,
Embase, Web of Science, Weipu and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) databases
were searched. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to
assess the strength of association. A total of 15 case-control studies with 8333 
cases and 36 036 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The results
suggested that rs4132601 was associated with an increased ALL risk. Significant
associations were found among Caucasians and Hispanics but not among Asians. In
subgroup analysis by age group, both adults and children showed increased ALL
risk. In subgroup analysis by subtype of ALL, significantly increased risks were 
observed in B-cell ALL and B hyperdiploid ALL, but not in T-cell ALL. This study 
suggests that IKZF1 rs4132601polymorphism is a risk factor for ALL.

Ikaros deletions in BCR-ABL-negative childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia are
associated with a distinct gene expression signature but do not result in
intrinsic chemoresistance.

BACKGROUND: Ikaros, the product of IKZF1, is a regulator of lymphoid development 
and polymorphisms in the gene have been associated with the acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). Additionally, IKZF1 deletions and mutations identify high-risk
biological subsets of childhood ALL [Georgopoulos et al. Cell 1995;83(2):289-299;
Mullighan et al. N Engl J Md 2009;360(5):470-480].
PROCEDURES: To discover the underlying pathways modulated by Ikaros we performed 
gene expression and gene ontology analysis in IKZF1 deleted primary B-ALL
pediatric patient samples. To validate downstream targets we performed qPCR on
individual patient samples. We also created IKZF1 knockdown B-ALL cell lines with
over 50% reduction of Ikaros, mimicking haplosufficient Ikaros deletions, and
again performed qPCR to investigate the downstream targets. Finally, to
understand the association of Ikaros deletion with a poor prognosis we challenged
our IKZF1 knockdown cell lines with chemotherapy and compared responses to IKZF1 
wild-type controls.
RESULTS: We report a specific gene expression signature of 735 up-regulated and
473 down-regulated genes in IKZF1 deleted primary B-ALL pediatric patient
samples. Gene ontology studies revealed an up-regulation of genes associated with
cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation, and motility in IKZF deleted patient
samples. Validated up-regulated target genes in IKZF1 deleted patient samples
included CTNND1 and PVRL2 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0003 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001), and RAB3IP and SPIB
(P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.032) were down-regulated. In further studies in IKZF1
knockdown cell lines, apoptosis assays showed no significant chemoresistance.
CONCLUSION: IKZF1 knockdown alone does not impart intrinsic chemotherapy
resistance suggesting that the association with a poor prognosis may be due to
additional lesions, microenvironmental interactions with the bone marrow niche,
or other factors.

For an overall characterization of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (BCPALL) with CRLF2 overexpression (OE), we conducted genetic analysis
of CRLF2 in 167 pediatric BCPALL patients. CRLF2 OE was detected in 30 (18%) of
167 patients, the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion was identified in only 3 (1.8%) of 167
patients, all of which demonstrated CRLF2 OE. Moreover, CRLF2 gain was identified
in 18 (11%) of 167 patients. Messenger RNA sequencing revealed a novel fusion
transcript, CSF2RA-CRLF2, in a case with CRLF2 OE, suggesting that this fusion is
associated with CRLF2 OE. In survival analysis, no significant differences in
5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were observed between
patients with and without CRLF2 OE (70.7 vs. 75.4%, log rank P = 0.68 and 96.4
vs. 82.1%, log rank P = 0.11, respectively). However, a significant difference in
5-year EFS between CRLF2 OE patients with and without IKZF1 deletion was observed
(44.4 vs. 83.1%, log rank P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, only IKZF1
deletion was a significant predictor of inferior OS (hazard ratio: 2.427, P =
0.04).These findings suggest that CRLF2 OE is not an independent prognostic
factor in pediatric BCPALL.

Cereblon (CRBN) mediates immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) action in multiple myeloma 
(MM). Using 2 different methodologies, we identified 244 CRBN binding proteins
and established relevance to MM biology by changes in their abundance after
exposure to lenalidomide. Proteins most reproducibly binding CRBN (>fourfold vs
controls) included DDB1, CUL4A, IKZF1, KPNA2, LTF, PFKL, PRKAR2A, RANGAP1, and
SHMT2. After lenalidomide treatment, the abundance of 46 CRBN binding proteins
decreased. We focused attention on 2 of these-IKZF1 and IKZF3. IZKF expression is
similar across all MM stages or subtypes; however, IKZF1 is substantially lower
in 3 of 5 IMiD-resistant MM cell lines. The cell line (FR4) with the lowest IKZF1
levels also harbors a damaging mutation and a translocation that upregulates
IRF4, an IKZF target. Clinical relevance of CRBN-binding proteins was
demonstrated in 44 refractory MM patients treated with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone therapy in whom low IKZF1 gene expression predicted lack of
response (0/11 responses in the lowest expression quartile). CRBN, IKZF1, and
KPNA2 levels also correlate with significant differences in overall survival. Our
study identifies CRBN-binding proteins and demonstrates that in addition to CRBN,
IKZF1, and KPNA2, expression can predict survival outcomes.

New mechanism of lenalidomide activity.

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Pharmacology Program; National Cancer Institute; Bethesda, MD USA.

Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) that has activity in hematologic
cancer (e.g., multiple myeloma). The immunomodulatory and apoptotic properties
are readily apparent in therapy. However, the exact mechanism of action has been 
difficult to quantify until recently when it was shown that another IMiD,
thalidomide, binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex constituent, CRBN. The
article by Kronke et al. demonstrates that, by binding to CRBN and altering its
selectivity, lenalidomide potentiates the ubiquitination and proteolysis of 2
specific proteins, IKZF1 and IKZF3. An article in the same issue, by Lu et al.,
supports these observations. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are transcription factors that are
necessary for multiple myeloma, and repression of these transcription factors is 
a likely mechanism for lenalidomide activity in this disease.

Historically, our understanding of mechanisms underlying human leukemogenesis are
inferred from genetically engineered mouse models. Relatively, few models that
use primary human cells recapitulate the full leukemic transformation as assayed 
in xenografts and myeloid transformation is infrequent. We report a humanized
experimental leukemia model where xenografts develop aggressive acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) with disseminated myeloid sarcomas within 4 weeks following
transplantation of cord blood transduced with vectors expressing BCR-ABL1 and a
dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS, Ik6. Ik6 induced transcriptional programs in
BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors that contained repressed B-cell progenitor
programs, along with strong stemness, proliferation and granulocyte-monocytic
progenitor (GMP) signatures-a novel combination not induced in control groups.
Thus, wild-type IKAROS restrains stemness properties and has tumor suppressor
activity in BCR-ABL1-initiated leukemia. Although IKAROS mutations/deletions are 
common in lymphoid transformation, they are found also at low frequency in AML
that progress from a prior myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) state. Our
experimental system provides an excellent model to gain insight into these rare
cases of AML transformation and the properties conferred by IKAROS loss of
function as a secondary mutation. More generally, our data points to the
importance of deregulated stemness/lineage commitment programs in human myeloid
leukemogenesis.

Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for thousands of
diseases and traits. We evaluated the relationships between specific risk factors
(for example, blood cholesterol level) and diseases on the basis of their shared 
genetic architecture in a comprehensive human disease-single-nucleotide
polymorphism association database (VARIMED), analyzing the findings from 8962
published association studies. Similarity between traits and diseases was
statistically evaluated on the basis of their association with shared gene
variants. We identified 120 disease-trait pairs that were statistically similar, 
and of these, we tested and validated five previously unknown disease-trait
associations by searching electronic medical records (EMRs) from three
independent medical centers for evidence of the trait appearing in patients
within 1 year of first diagnosis of the disease. We validated that the mean
corpuscular volume is elevated before diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia; 
both have associated variants in the gene IKZF1. Platelet count is decreased
before diagnosis of alcohol dependence; both are associated with variants in the 
gene C12orf51. Alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in patients with venous
thromboembolism; both share variants in ABO. Similarly, we found that
prostate-specific antigen and serum magnesium levels were altered before the
diagnosis of lung cancer and gastric cancer, respectively. Disease-trait
associations identify traits that could serve as future prognostics, if validated
through EMR and subsequent prospective trials.

Naive CD4(+) T cells require signals from the TCR and CD28 to produce IL-2,
expand, and differentiate. However, these same signals are not sufficient to
induce autocrine IL-2 production by naive CD8(+) T cells, which require cytokines
provided by other cell types to drive their differentiation. The basis for failed
autocrine IL-2 production by activated CD8(+) cells is unclear. We find that
Ikaros, a transcriptional repressor that silences IL-2 in anergic CD4(+) T cells,
also restricts autocrine IL-2 production by CD8(+) T cells. We find that CD8(+) T
cell activation in vitro in the absence of exogenous cytokines and CD4 help leads
to marked induction of Ikaros, a known repressor of the Il2 gene. Naive murine
CD8 T cells haplo-insufficient for Ikzf1 failed to upregulate Ikaros, produced
autocrine IL-2, and differentiated in an IL-2-dependent manner into
IFN-<U+03B3>-producing CTLs in response to TCR/CD28 stimulation alone. Furthermore,
Ikzf1 haplo-insufficient CD8(+) T cells were more effective at controlling
Listeria infection and B16 melanoma growth in vivo, and they could provide help
to neighboring, non-IL-2-producing cells to differentiate into IFN-<U+03B3>-producing
effectors. Therefore, by repressing autocrine IL-2 production, Ikaros ensures
that naive CD8(+) T cells remain dependent on licensing by APCs and CD4(+) T
cells, and it may therefore act as a cell-intrinsic safeguard against
inappropriate CTL differentiation and immunopathology.

Hispanic children have a higher incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
than non-Hispanic whites but tend to be diagnosed at older ages. In genome-wide
association studies, Native American ancestry and polymorphisms in six genes have
been associated with ALL risk. In multivariable regression models, we
investigated whether genomic ancestry, inherited risk SNPs, or acquired somatic
alterations were associated with differences in age at diagnosis in Hispanic
children with B-cell ALL. Genome-wide array data were used to estimate each
participant's percent membership in the three Hispanic ancestral populations:
Native American, African, and European. Each 20% increase in European ancestry
was associated with a six month younger age at diagnosis (95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36-11.6
months, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.037). Correspondingly, each 20% increase in Native American
ancestry was associated with a six-month older age at diagnosis (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.037). Both
the TEL-AML1 translocation and high-hyperdiploidy were associated with younger
age at diagnosis (24.4 months, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.0 x 10(-4) and 12.4 months, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.011,
respectively), while CDKN2A and IKZF1 deletions were associated with older age at
diagnosis (19.7 months, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.0 x 10(-4) and 18.1 months, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.012,
respectively). No associations with age at diagnosis were observed for RAS
mutation, PAX5 deletion or for known heritable risk alleles in IKZF1, CDKN2A,
PIP4K2A, GATA3, ARID5B, or CEBPE. Because younger age at diagnosis is associated 
with improved treatment outcomes for children with ALL, the effect of European
ancestry on ALL survival may be mediated by its effect on age at diagnosis, or by
proxy, its association with more treatable molecular subtypes of ALL.

With intensified pediatric-like therapy and genetic disease dissection, the field
of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has evolved recently. In this new
context, we aimed to reassess the value of conventional risk factors with regard 
to new genetic alterations and early response to therapy, as assessed by
immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. The study
was performed in 423 younger adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL in 
first remission (265 B-cell precursor [BCP] and 158 T-cell ALL), with cumulative 
incidence of relapse (CIR) as the primary end point. In addition to conventional 
risk factors, the most frequent currently available genetic alterations were
included in the analysis. A higher specific hazard of relapse was independently
associated with postinduction MRD level =10(-4) and unfavorable genetic
characteristics (ie, MLL gene rearrangement or focal IKZF1 gene deletion in
BCP-ALL and no NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutation and/or N/K-RAS mutation and/or PTEN gene
alteration in T-cell ALL). These 2 factors allowed definition of a new risk
classification that is strongly associated with higher CIR and shorter
relapse-free and overall survival. These results indicate that genetic
abnormalities are important predictors of outcome in adult ALL not fully
recapitulated by early response to therapy. Patients included in this study were 
treated in the multicenter GRAALL-2003 and GRAALL-2005 trials. Both trials were
registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00222027 and #NCT00327678,
respectively.

BACKGROUND: The coexistence of t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) and inv(16)(p13q22) chromosomal
abnormalities is extremely uncommon, and only a small number of such cases have
been reported. Here, we characterized 7 cases of hematologic malignancy
exhibiting t(9;22) and inv(16) coexistence.
METHODS: We reviewed the cytogenetic data for hematologic malignancies treated at
the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center between January 2004 and
June 2013. We identified 7 cases exhibiting t(9;22) and inv(16) coexistence. In
addition, we analyzed mutations in the IKZF1, NPM1, FLT3, N-RAS, K-RAS, c-KIT,
and TP53 genes.
RESULTS: Four cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 1 chronic phase, 2
accelerated phase, and 1 blast phase) and 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML;
1 de novo and 2 therapy-related) were identified. The percentages of circulating 
blasts and bone marrow eosinophils were higher in AML cases than in CML cases
(53% vs. 5% and 30% vs. 5.5%, respectively). The proportions of each chromosomal 
abnormality were used along with follow-up karyotyping results to identify
secondary changes. In BCR/ABL, a p210 fusion transcript was associated with CML, 
whereas a p190 fusion transcript was associated with AML. One patient with AML
harbored 2 mutations: c-KIT D816V and TP53 E11Q. All patients except 1 with CML
blast phase sustained clinical remission after treatment, which included an
imatinib mesylate regimen.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that observations of bone marrow morphology, initial
and follow-up cytogenetic studies, and karyotyping of BCR/ABL1 and CBFB/MYH11
provide valuable information for characterizing hematologic malignancies
exhibiting t(9;22) and inv(16) coexistence.

Current concepts in pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

Children's Hospital Colorado , Aurora, CO , USA.

The t(9;22)(q34;q11) or Philadelphia chromosome creates a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene
encoding for a chimeric BCR-ABL1 protein. It is present in 3-4% of pediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL), and about 25% of adult ALL cases. Prior
to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), Ph(+) ALL was associated with 
a very poor prognosis despite the use of intensive chemotherapy and frequently
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission. The
development of TKIs revolutionized the therapy of Ph(+) ALL. Addition of the
first generation ABL1 class TKI imatinib to intensive chemotherapy dramatically
increased the survival for children with Ph(+) ALL and established that many
patients can be cured without HSCT. In parallel, the mechanistic understanding of
Ph(+) ALL expanded exponentially through careful mapping of pathways downstream
of BCR-ABL1, the discovery of mutations in master regulators of B-cell
development such as IKZF1 (Ikaros), PAX5, and early B-cell factor (EBF), the
recognition of the complex clonal architecture of Ph(+) ALL, and the delineation 
of genomic, epigenetic, and signaling abnormalities contributing to relapse and
resistance. Still, many important basic and clinical questions remain unanswered.
Current clinical trials are testing second generation TKIs in patients with newly
diagnosed Ph(+) ALL. Neither the optimal duration of therapy nor the optimal
chemotherapy backbone are currently defined. The role of HSCT in first remission 
and post-transplant TKI therapy also require further study. In addition, it will 
be crucial to continue to dig deeper into understanding Ph(+) ALL at a
mechanistic level, and translate findings into complementary targeted approaches.
Expanding targeted therapies hold great promise to decrease toxicity and improve 
survival in this high-risk disease, which provides a paradigm for how targeted
therapies can be incorporated into treatment of other high-risk leukemias.

Interferon (IFN) activation signaling and T helper 17 (Th17)-cell/B-cell
regulation play a critical role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE). Several studies have provided convincing evidence that
polymorphisms in IRF5, STAT4, IKZF1 and ETS1 from these pathways may be involved 
in SLE by affecting gene expression or epistasis. We analyzed the genetic
interaction in known SLE susceptibility loci from the four genes in northern Han 
Chinese. A total of 946 northern Han Chinese participated in this study (370
unrelated SLE patients and 576 healthy controls). Subjects underwent genotyping
for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2004640 in IRF5, rs7574865 in
STAT4, rs4917014 in IKZF1 and rs1128334 in ETS1 by use of a TaqMan SNP genotyping
assay and direct sequencing. Gene-gene interaction analysis involved direct
counting, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and linear regression
analysis. SLE patients and controls differed in allele frequencies of rs7574865, 
rs1128334 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and rs4917014 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01). Direct counting revealed that the
frequency of risk homozygote combinations was higher for SLE patients than
controls (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01). Furthermore, 2-, 3- and 4-way gene-gene epistasis in SLE was
confirmed by parametric methods and MDR analysis. Gene expression analysis
partially supported the findings. Our study confirmed the association of the IFN 
pathway or Th17/B-cells and the pathogenesis of SLE, and gene-gene interaction in
this pathway may increase the risk of SLE.

Early recognition of children with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia
(CML-CP) at risk for developing a lymphoid blast crisis (LyBC) is desirable,
because therapy options in CML-LyBC are limited. We used Multiplex
Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification to determine whether B-cell lymphoid
leukaemia-specific copy number alterations (CNAs) (e.g. IKZF1, PAX5, CDKN2A
deletions) could be detected in CML-CP and may be used to predict disease
progression to LyBC. CNAs were detected in all patients with CML-LyBC, but in
none of the 77 patients with CML-CP. Based on this study we conclude that CNAs
remain a hallmark of disease progression.

Pathogenesis and regulation of cellular proliferation in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia - the role of Ikaros.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia of
childhood. Over the last 50 years there have been tremendous scientific advances 
in understanding the pathogenesis and the mechanisms that control cellular
proliferation in ALL. These discoveries led to the development of efficient
therapeutic regimens that greatly improved survival of children with ALL.
Recently, several genes have been demonstrated to play a key role in tumor
suppression and that their deregulation leads to malignant transformation and can
affect overall survival. This review summarizes the role of Ikaros (IKZF1) in
tumor suppression and regulation of gene expression in leukemia. Deletions and/or
mutations of Ikaros have been detected in a large percentage of pediatric and
adult ALL and reduced Ikaros function has been associated with poor outcome in
ALL. Ikaros function in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation of gene
transcription emphasizes the important role of this protein in controlling
cellular proliferation. In this review, we particularly focus on the role of
signaling pathways in the regulation of Ikaros activity and its transcriptional
control in leukemia.

The tumor suppressor Ikaros shapes the repertoire of notch target genes in T
cells.

The Notch signaling pathway is activated in many cell types, but its effects are 
cell type- and stage-specific. In the immune system, Notch activity is required
for the differentiation of T cell progenitors, but it is reduced in more mature
thymocytes, in which Notch is oncogenic. Studies based on single-gene models have
suggested that the tumor suppressor protein Ikaros plays an important role in
repressing the transcription of Notch target genes. We used genome-wide analyses,
including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, to identify genes controlled 
by Notch and Ikaros in gain- and loss-of-function experiments. We found that
Ikaros bound to and directly repressed the expression of most genes that are
activated by Notch. Specific deletion of Ikaros in thymocytes led to the
persistent expression of Notch target genes that are essential for T cell
maturation, as well as the rapid development of T cell leukemias in mice.
Expression of Notch target genes that are normally silent in T cells, but are
activated by Notch in other cell types, occurred in T cells of mice genetically
deficient in Ikaros. We propose that Ikaros shapes the timing and repertoire of
the Notch transcriptional response in T cells through widespread targeting of
elements adjacent to Notch regulatory sequences. These results provide a
molecular framework for understanding the regulation of tissue-specific and
tumor-related Notch responses.

B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL) are subdivided by the WHO classification 
into five subgroups defined by specific translocations and two further subgroups 
defined by the number of chromosomes. The hypodiploid subgroup is heterogeneous
and comprises ALL with a chromosome number of <46. To characterize a specific
subset with low hypodiploid karyotype, we performed chromosome banding analysis, 
FISH, array comparative genomic hybridization, and mutational analyses of FBXW7, 
NOTCH1, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and IKZF1 in 29 cases. We observed a nonrandom pattern 
of chromosome losses, including chromosomes 3, 7, 13, 15, 16, and 17. A deletion 
encompassing the CDKN2A/B locus was the only recurrent structural abnormality. A 
duplication of the low hypodiploid karyotype occurred frequently, resulting in a 
near triploid karyotype based on the definition by merely counting chromosomes
but in fact was a very low tetraploid chromosome set. Mutational analyses
revealed no mutations in IKZF1, FBXW7, NOTCH1, and KRAS and only one mutation in 
NRAS. However, we discovered a high frequency of TP53 mutations in 93% (27/29) of
cases. In 26/27 cases with TP53 mutation, the second TP53 allele was lost due to 
monosomy 17. Median overall survival was short (18.5 months), which might be
related to the high frequency of TP53 alterations. Therefore, ALL with low
hypodiploidy is characterized by a typical pattern of chromosome losses and a
remarkably high TP53 mutation frequency. Our data suggest the introduction of a
novel WHO entity within the B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma group showing low
hypodiploid/very low tetraploid karyotype and concomitant TP53 mutation.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer,
characterized by a peak of incidence between 2 and 5 years. Since recently
conducted genome-wide association (GWA) studies revealed that the common
low-penetrance susceptibility allele at 7p12.2 (IKZF1 gene) confers an increased 
risk of pediatric ALL, we investigated whether the risk allele at rs4132601 also 
coexists with well-established prognostic factors, among 508 Polish pediatric
patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Additionally, to verify whether the risk
allele is favored by somatic tumor evolution, we examined the incidence of IKZF1 
deletions in leukemic clones derived from 153 previously genotyped cases of
pediatric ALL. Results of the analysis provide statistically significant support 
for an association between the rs4132601 polymorphic site and age at diagnosis of
childhood ALL (p = 0.04). No association between allele variant and occurrence of
IKZF1 deletions was found. These data provide further evidence of a biological
role of gene variants in the development of ALL.

Retroviral insertional mutagenesis (RIM) is a powerful tool for cancer genomics
that was combined in this study with deep sequencing (RIM/DS) to facilitate a
comprehensive analysis of lymphoma progression. Transgenic mice expressing two
potent collaborating oncogenes in the germ line (CD2-MYC, -Runx2) develop rapid
onset tumours that can be accelerated and rendered polyclonal by neonatal Moloney
murine leukaemia virus (MoMLV) infection. RIM/DS analysis of 28 polyclonal
lymphomas identified 771 common insertion sites (CISs) defining a 'progression
network' that encompassed a remarkably large fraction of known MoMLV target
genes, with further strong indications of oncogenic selection above the
background of MoMLV integration preference. Progression driven by RIM was
characterised as a Darwinian process of clonal competition engaging proliferation
control networks downstream of cytokine and T-cell receptor signalling. Enhancer 
mode activation accounted for the most efficiently selected CIS target genes,
including Ccr7 as the most prominent of a set of chemokine receptors driving
paracrine growth stimulation and lymphoma dissemination. Another large target
gene subset including candidate tumour suppressors was disrupted by intragenic
insertions. A second RIM/DS screen comparing lymphomas of wild-type and parental 
transgenics showed that CD2-MYC tumours are virtually dependent on activation of 
Runx family genes in strong preference to other potent Myc collaborating genes
(Gfi1, Notch1). Ikzf1 was identified as a novel collaborating gene for Runx2 and 
illustrated the interface between integration preference and oncogenic selection.
Lymphoma target genes for MoMLV can be classified into (a) a small set of master 
regulators that confer self-renewal; overcoming p53 and other failsafe pathways
and (b) a large group of progression genes that control autonomous proliferation 
in transformed cells. These findings provide insights into retroviral biology,
human cancer genetics and the safety of vector-mediated gene therapy.

This study reviewed the clinical characteristics of 112 pediatric B-cell
precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients with TCF3-PBX1 fusion
treated according to the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS)
ALL02 protocol (n = 82) and Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group (CCLSG)
ALL 2004 protocol (n = 30). The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall
survival (OS) rates were 85.4 ± 3.9% and 89.0 ± 3.5% in JACLS cohort, and the
5-year EFS and OS were 82.8 ± 7.0% and 86.3 ± 6.4% in CCLSG cohort, respectively,
which are comparable to those reported in western countries. Conventional
prognostic factors such as age at onset, initial white blood cell count, and
National Cancer Institute risk have also no impact on OS in both cohorts.
Surprisingly, the pattern of relapse in JACLS cohort, 9 of 82 patients, was
unique: eight of nine patients relapsed during the maintenance phase and one
patient had primary induction failure. However, bone marrow status and assessment
of minimal residual disease on days 15 and 33 did not identify those patients.
Interestingly, the two patients with IKZF1 deletion eventually relapsed in JACLS 
cohort, as did one patient in CCLSG cohort. International collaborative study of 
larger cohort is warranted to clarify the impact of the IKZF1 deletion on the
poor outcome of TCF3-PBX1 positive BCP-ALL.

BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia in early age (EAL) is characterized by acquired
genetic alterations such as MLL rearrangements (MLL-r). The aim of this
case-controlled study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE could be related to the onset of EAL cases
(<24 months-old at diagnosis).
METHODS: The SNPs (IKZF1 rs11978267, ARID5B rs10821936 and rs10994982, CEBPE
rs2239633) were genotyped in 265 cases [169 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
and 96 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] and 505 controls by Taqman allelic
discrimination assay. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association
between SNPs of cases and controls, adjusted on skin color and/or age. The risk
was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval
(CI).
RESULTS: Children with the IKZF1 SNP had an increased risk of developing
MLL-germline ALL in white children. The heterozygous/mutant genotype in ARID5B
rs10994982 significantly increased the risk for MLL-germline leukemia in white
and non-white children (OR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.09-6.18 and OR 3.55, 95% CI:
1.57-8.68, respectively). The heterozygous genotype in ARID5B rs10821936
increased the risk for MLL-r leukemia in both white and non-white (OR 2.06, 95%
CI: 1.12-3.79 and OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.09-5.10, respectively). Furthermore, ARID5B 
rs10821936 conferred increased risk for MLL-MLLT3 positive cases (OR 7.10, 95%
CI:1.54-32.68). Our data do not show evidence that CEBPE rs2239633 confers
increased genetic susceptibility to EAL.
CONCLUSIONS: IKZF1 and CEBPE variants seem to play a minor role in genetic
susceptibility to EAL, while ARID5B rs10821936 increased the risk of MLL-MLLT3.
This result shows that genetic susceptibility could be associated with the
differences regarding MLL breakpoints and partner genes.

Epstein-Barr virus utilizes Ikaros in regulating its latent-lytic switch in B
cells.

Ikaros is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that regulates chromatin remodeling
and the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and Notch
signaling. It is a master regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and functions
as a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nevertheless, no previous 
reports described effects of Ikaros on the life cycle of any human lymphotropic
virus. Here, we demonstrate that full-length Ikaros (IK-1) functions as a major
factor in the maintenance of viral latency in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive
Burkitt's lymphoma Sal and MutuI cell lines. Either silencing of Ikaros
expression by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown or ectopic expression of a
non-DNA-binding isoform induced lytic gene expression. These effects synergized
with other lytic inducers of EBV, including transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) 
and the hypoxia mimic desferrioxamine. Data from chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses indicated 
that Ikaros did not bind to either of the EBV immediate early genes BZLF1 and
BRLF1. Rather, Ikaros affected the expression of Oct-2 and Bcl-6, other
transcription factors that directly inhibit EBV reactivation and plasma cell
differentiation, respectively. IK-1 also complexed with the EBV immediate early R
protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays and partially colocalized with R within
cells. The presence of R alleviated IK-1-mediated transcriptional repression,
with IK-1 then cooperating with Z and R to enhance lytic gene expression. Thus,
we conclude that Ikaros plays distinct roles at different stages of EBV's life
cycle: it contributes to maintaining latency via indirect mechanisms, and it may 
also synergize with Z and R to enhance lytic replication through direct
association with R and/or R-induced alterations in Ikaros' functional activities 
via cellular signaling pathways.IMPORTANCE: This is the first report showing that
the cellular protein Ikaros, a known master regulator of hematopoiesis and
critical tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also plays important
roles in the life cycle of Epstein-Barr virus in B cells.

The transcription factor Ikaros is an essential regulator of lymphopoiesis. Here 
we studied its B cell-specific function by conditional inactivation of the gene
encoding Ikaros (Ikzf1) in pro-B cells. B cell development was arrested at an
aberrant 'pro-B cell' stage characterized by increased cell adhesion and loss of 
signaling via the pre-B cell signaling complex (pre-BCR). Ikaros activated genes 
encoding signal transducers of the pre-BCR and repressed genes involved in the
downregulation of pre-BCR signaling and upregulation of the integrin signaling
pathway. Unexpectedly, derepression of expression of the transcription factor
Aiolos did not compensate for the loss of Ikaros in pro-B cells. Ikaros induced
or suppressed active chromatin at regulatory elements of activated or repressed
target genes. Notably, binding of Ikaros and expression of its target genes were 
dynamically regulated at distinct stages of early B lymphopoiesis.

BACKGROUND: The development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is accompanied by
extensive epigenetic changes, including frequent regional hypermethylation
particularly of gene promoter regions. Specific genes, including SEPT9, VIM1 and 
TMEFF2 become methylated in a high fraction of cancers and diagnostic assays for 
detection of cancer-derived methylated DNA sequences in blood and/or fecal
samples are being developed. There is considerable potential for the development 
of new DNA methylation biomarkers or panels to improve the sensitivity and
specificity of current cancer detection tests.
METHODS: Combined epigenomic methods - activation of gene expression in CRC cell 
lines following DNA demethylating treatment, and two novel methods of genome-wide
methylation assessment - were used to identify candidate genes methylated in a
high fraction of CRCs. Multiplexed amplicon sequencing of PCR products from
bisulfite-treated DNA of matched CRC and non-neoplastic tissue as well as healthy
donor peripheral blood was performed using Roche 454 sequencing. Levels of DNA
methylation in colorectal tissues and blood were determined by quantitative
methylation specific PCR (qMSP).
RESULTS: Combined analyses identified 42 candidate genes for evaluation as DNA
methylation biomarkers. DNA methylation profiles of 24 of these genes were
characterised by multiplexed bisulfite-sequencing in ten matched tumor/normal
tissue samples; differential methylation in CRC was confirmed for 23 of these
genes. qMSP assays were developed for 32 genes, including 15 of the sequenced
genes, and used to quantify methylation in tumor, adenoma and non-neoplastic
colorectal tissue and from healthy donor peripheral blood. 24 of the 32 genes
were methylated in >50% of neoplastic samples, including 11 genes that were
methylated in 80% or more CRCs and a similar fraction of adenomas.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has characterised a panel of 23 genes that show elevated 
DNA methylation in >50% of CRC tissue relative to non-neoplastic tissue. Six of
these genes (SOX21, SLC6A15, NPY, GRASP, ST8SIA1 and ZSCAN18) show very low
methylation in non-neoplastic colorectal tissue and are candidate biomarkers for 
stool-based assays, while 11 genes (BCAT1, COL4A2, DLX5, FGF5, FOXF1, FOXI2,
GRASP, IKZF1, IRF4, SDC2 and SOX21) have very low methylation in peripheral blood
DNA and are suitable for further evaluation as blood-based diagnostic markers.

Here we report the results of gene expression analyses using multiple probesets
aimed at determining the incidence of Ikaros/IKZF1 deletions in pediatric
B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BPL). Primary leukemia cells from 122
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)(+) BPL patients and 237 Ph(-) BPL patients as well
as normal hematopoietic cells from 74 normal non-leukemic bone marrow specimens
were organized according to expression levels of IKZF1 transcripts utilizing
two-way hierarchical clustering technique to identify specimens with low IKZF1
expression for the 10 probesets interrogating Exons 1 through 4 and Exon 8. Our
analysis demonstrated no changes in expression that would be expected from
homozygous or heterozygous deletions of IKZF1 in primary leukemic cells. Similar 
results were obtained in gene expression analysis of primary leukemic cells from 
20 Ph(+) positive and 155 Ph(-) BPL patients in a validation dataset. Taken
together, our gene expression analyses in 534 pediatric BPL cases, including 142 
cases with Ph(+) BPL, contradict previous reports that were based on SNP array
data and suggested that Ph(+) pediatric BPL is characterized by a high frequency 
of homozygous or heterozygous IKZF1 deletions. Further, exon-specific genomic PCR
analysis of primary leukemia cells from 21 high-risk pediatric BPL patients and
11 standard-risk pediatric BPL patients, and 8 patients with infant BPL did not
show any evidence for homozygous IKZF1 locus deletions. Nor was there any
evidence for homozygous or heterozygous intragenic IKZF1 deletions.

Thalidomide and related drugs are key drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma
(MM). These agents bind to cereblon, a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex,
altering the specificity of the complex to induce the ubiquitylation and
degradation of Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), transcription factors essential
for MM growth.

Overexpression of AIOLOS inhibits cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis in 
Nalm-6 cells.

The AIOLOS gene is important in the control of mature B-lymphocyte
differentiation and proliferation. Previous research has shown that deregulated
AIOLOS expression is associated with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in human patients. However, the function
of AIOLOS in childhood B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL is not fully understood. In the
present study, Nalm-6 cells were divided into three groups: the untransfected
control (UT), the lentiviral vector control (Lenti-Mock) and the
AIOLOS-overexpressing (Lenti-AIOLOS) group. Lenti-AIOLOS Nalm-6 cells were
constructed by lentiviral transduction, followed by cell proliferation assay,
cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis assay, to evaluate the effects of AIOLOS on
proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells in vitro.
Moreover, the expression levels of genes associated with apoptosis and the cell
cycle, as well as the transcription factors IKZF1 and NF-<U+03BA>B, were investigated by
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot
analysis. The results showed that the proliferation of Nalm-6 cells in the
Lenti-AIOLOS group was reduced by 16% on day 8 compared with cells in the UT
group (P>0.05). The reduction peaked at 29% on day 10 (P<0.05). The percentage of
Nalm-6 cells in the G0/G1 phase increased from 70.4 (UT) to 84.1% (Lenti-AIOLOS) 
(P<0.01), and the S-phase cells decreased from 20.3 (UT) to 11.7% (Lenti-AIOLOS) 
(P<0.01). Total apoptotic cells significantly decreased in AIOLOS-transfected
Nalm-6 cells (10.75%) compared with those in the Lenti-Mock (17.00%) or UT group 
(19.05%) (P<0.01). In particular, the difference between the groups in the
percentage of late apoptotic cells was significant (2.85 vs. 7.95%; P<0.01). In
addition, overexpression of AIOLOS resulted in upregulation of BCL-2 and
downregulation of CCND3, BAX, IKZF1 and NF-<U+03BA>B. No changes were detected on C-MYC 
and P27. Our findings indicate that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of AIOLOS 
in Nalm-6 cells could inhibit cell proliferation, suppress cell apoptosis and
arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in vitro.

Change in transcription start site (TSS) usage is an important mechanism for the 
control of transcription process, and has a significant effect on the isoforms
being transcribed. One of the goals in the study of TSS is the understanding of
how and why their usage differs in different tissues or under different
conditions. In light of recent efforts in the mapping of transcription start site
landscape using high-throughput sequencing approaches, a quantitative and
automated method is needed to process all the data that are being produced. In
this work we propose a statistical approach that will classify changes in TSS
distribution between different samples into several categories of changes that
may have biological significance. Genes selected by the classifiers can then be
analyzed together with additional supporting data to determine their biological
significance. We use a set of time-course TSS data from mouse dendritic cells
stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to demonstrate the usefulness of our
method.

Childhood BCR-ABL1-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(BCP-ALL) has an unfavorable outcome and shows high frequency of IKZF1 deletions.
The prognostic value of IKZF1 deletions was evaluated in 2 cohorts of
BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL patients, before tyrosine kinase inhibitors (pre-TKI)
and after introduction of imatinib (in the European Study for Philadelphia-Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia [EsPhALL]). In 126/191 (66%) cases an IKZF1 deletion was
detected. In the pre-TKI cohort, IKZF1-deleted patients had an unfavorable
outcome compared with wild-type patients (4-year disease-free survival [DFS] of
30.0 ± 6.8% vs 57.5 ± 9.4%; P = .01). In the EsPhALL cohort, the IKZF1 deletions 
were associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients stratified in the
good-risk arm based on early clinical response (4-year DFS of 51.9 ± 8.8% for
IKZF1-deleted vs 78.6 ± 13.9% for IKZF1 wild-type; P = .03), even when treated
with imatinib (4-year DFS of 55.5 ± 9.5% for IKZF1-deleted vs 75.0 ± 21.7% for
IKZF1 wild-type; P = .05). In conclusion, the highly unfavorable outcome for
childhood BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL with IKZF1 deletions, irrespective of
imatinib exposure, underscores the need for alternative therapies. In contrast,
good-risk patients with IKZF1 wild-type responded remarkably well to
imatinib-containing regimens, providing a rationale to potentially avoid
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in this subset of patients.

Cereblon (CRBN), the molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, is a
substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4(CRBN) . T
cell co-stimulation by lenalidomide or pomalidomide is cereblon dependent:
however, the CRL4(CRBN) substrates responsible for T cell co-stimulation have yet
to be identified. Here we demonstrate that interaction of the transcription
factors Ikaros (IKZF1, encoded by the IKZF1 gene) and Aiolos (IKZF3, encoded by
the IKZF3 gene) with CRL4(CRBN) is induced by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Each 
agent promotes Aiolos and Ikaros binding to CRL4(CRBN) with enhanced
ubiquitination leading to cereblon-dependent proteosomal degradation in T
lymphocytes. We confirm that Aiolos and Ikaros are transcriptional repressors of 
interleukin-2 expression. The findings link lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-induced
degradation of these transcriptional suppressors to well documented T cell
activation. Importantly, Aiolos could serve as a proximal pharmacodynamic marker 
for lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as healthy human subjects administered
lenalidomide demonstrated Aiolos degradation in their peripheral T cells. In
conclusion, we present a molecular model in which drug binding to cereblon
results in the interaction of Ikaros and Aiolos to CRL4(CRBN) , leading to their 
ubiquitination, subsequent proteasomal degradation and T cell activation.

Lenalidomide is a drug with clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma and other B
cell neoplasms, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Using quantitative
proteomics, we found that lenalidomide causes selective ubiquitination and
degradation of two lymphoid transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3, by the
CRBN-CRL4 ubiquitin ligase. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are essential transcription factors
in multiple myeloma. A single amino acid substitution of IKZF3 conferred
resistance to lenalidomide-induced degradation and rescued lenalidomide-induced
inhibition of cell growth. Similarly, we found that lenalidomide-induced
interleukin-2 production in T cells is due to depletion of IKZF1 and IKZF3. These
findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of action for a therapeutic agent:
alteration of the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to selective
degradation of specific targets.

Thalidomide-like drugs such as lenalidomide are clinically important treatments
for multiple myeloma and show promise for other B cell malignancies. The
biochemical mechanisms underlying their antitumor activity are unknown.
Thalidomide was recently shown to bind to, and inhibit, the cereblon ubiquitin
ligase. Cereblon loss in zebrafish causes fin defects reminiscent of the limb
defects seen in children exposed to thalidomide in utero. Here we show that
lenalidomide-bound cereblon acquires the ability to target for proteasomal
degradation two specific B cell transcription factors, Ikaros family zinc finger 
proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3). Analysis of myeloma cell lines revealed that 
loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 is both necessary and sufficient for lenalidomide's
therapeutic effect, suggesting that the antitumor and teratogenic activities of
thalidomide-like drugs are dissociable.

We examined the constitutive function of the Ikaros (IK) transcription factor in 
blast cells from pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BPL)
patients using multiple assay platforms and bioinformatics tools. We found no
evidence of diminished IK expression or function for primary cells from high-risk
BPL patients including a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)(+) subset. Relapse clones
as well as very aggressive in vivo clonogenic leukemic B-cell precursors isolated
from spleens of xenografted NOD/SCID mice that developed overt leukemia after
inoculation with primary leukemic cells of patients with BPL invariably and
abundantly expressed intact IK protein. These results demonstrate that a lost or 
diminished IK function is not a characteristic feature of leukemic cells in Ph(+)
or Ph(-) high-risk BPL.

BACKGROUND: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a heterogeneous disease
that includes multiple subtypes is defined by cell lineage and chromosome
anomalies. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several ARID5B 
and IKZF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of
ALL. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and convenient technique
to detect SNPs; we thereby detected SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes.
METHODS: We enrolled 79 pediatric ALL patients and 80 healthy controls.
Polymorphic variants of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B
(rs7073837, rs10740055, and rs7089424) were detected by HRM, and SNPs were
analyzed for association with childhood ALL.
RESULTS: The distribution of genotype rs7073837 in ARID5B significantly differed 
between ALL and controls (P=0.046), while those of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601,
and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs10740055 and rs7089424) did not. We analyzed the
association for SNPs with B lineage ALL to find rs7073837 in ARID5B, conferring a
higher risk for B lineage ALL (odds ratio, OR=1.70, 95% confidence interval,
CI=1.01-2.87, P=0.049).
CONCLUSION: HRM is a practical method to detect SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes.
We found that rs7073837 in ARID5B correlated with a risk for childhood B lineage 
ALL.

The purpose of this study was to summary the clinical and laboratorial features
in 15 adult cases of mixed phenotypic acute leukemia with Ph chromosome and/or
BCR-ABL fusion gene positive (Ph(+)MPAL), 15 adult patients with Ph(+)MPAL were
defined by WHO-2008 classification. The clinical characteristics, results of
morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular genetic detections and results
of follow-up in 15 adult patients with Ph(+)MPAL were analyzed retrospectively.
The results showed that 15 patients among 87 cases of MPAL demonstrated Ph(+)MPAL
(17.2%; 15/87) (7 males and 8 females), their median age was 51 (range 16-81)
year old and median WBC count at diagnosis was 69 (12.7-921)×10(9)/L. Based on
FAB criteria, these patients showed different morphologic types, including AML
(13.3%; 2/15), ALL (40.0%; 6/15), HAL (46.7%; 7/15). Immunologic analysis
indicated that 15 cases of Ph(-)MPAL were all classified as B-lymphoid +myeloid
mixed immunophenotype. Except one patient, all expressed CD34 antigen on the
surface of leukemia cells with 64.3% strong positive, only Ph (53.3%; 8/15), Ph
with additional chromosomal abnormalities (33.3%; 5/15) and normal karyotype
(13.3%; 2/15) were cytogenetically identified. BCR-ABL fusion gene transcript
positive were detected by multiplex reverse transcription PCR in all cases, with 
e1a2 subtype (p190) (40.0%; 6/15) and b2a2 or b3a2 (p210) subtype (60.0%; 9/15). 
Four out of 7 (57.1%) patients were found to have IKZF1 gene deletion, without
other common gene mutations. Seven out of 10 cases (70.0%) achieved complete
remission (CR) after one cycle of induction chemotherapy. In the induction stage,
CR rate seemed higher when tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were added to
chemotherapy (83.3%:50.0%; P = 0.206). Overall survival (OS) in 4 patients
received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was
longer than that in 4 patients received chemotherapy alone (P = 0.004). It is
concluded that Ph(+)MPAL mainly is expressed as B+My phenotype. The majority of
patients is older and has CD34 overexpression. In the aspect of molecular
genetics, the Ph(+)MPAL is similar to other acute leukemia with Ph chromosome.
Ph(+)MPAL is a subtype of acute leukemia with poor prognosis. WBC count at
diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor. The combination of TKI and
allo-HSCT can improve their long-term survival, which needs to be confirmed
through carrying out a prospective and multicenter clinical trial for newly
diagnosed Ph(+)MPAL.

Recent genomic profiling of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
identified a high-risk subtype with an expression signature resembling that of
Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL and poor prognosis (Ph-like ALL). However,
the role of inherited genetic variation in Ph-like ALL pathogenesis remains
unknown. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 511 ALL cases and 6,661
non-ALL controls, we identified a susceptibility locus for Ph-like ALL (GATA3,
rs3824662; P = 2.17 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR) = 3.85 for Ph-like ALL versus
non-ALL; P = 1.05 × 10(-8), OR = 3.25 for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL),
with independent validation. The rs3824662 risk allele was associated with
somatic lesions underlying Ph-like ALL (CRLF2 rearrangement, JAK gene mutation
and IKZF1 deletion) and with variation in GATA3 expression. Finally, genotype at 
the GATA3 SNP was also associated with early treatment response and risk of ALL
relapse. Our results provide insights into interactions between inherited and
somatic variants and their role in ALL pathogenesis and prognosis.

The interplay between copy number variation (CNV) and differential gene
expression may be able to shed light on molecular process underlying breast
cancer and lead to the discovery of cancer-related genes. In the current study,
genes concurrently identified in array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
and gene expression microarrays were used to derive gene signatures for Han
Chinese breast cancers. We performed 23 array CGHs and 81 gene expression
microarrays in breast cancer samples from Taiwanese women. Genes with coherent
patterns of both CNV and differential gene expression were identified from the 21
samples assayed using both platforms. We used these genes to derive signatures
associated with clinical ER and HER2 status and disease-free survival.
DISTRIBUTIONS OF SIGNATURE GENES WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CHROMOSOMAL
LOCATION: chromosome 16 for ER and 17 for HER2. A breast cancer risk predictive
model was built based on the first supervised principal component from 16 genes
(RCAN3, MCOLN2, DENND2D, RWDD3, ZMYM6, CAPZA1, GPR18, WARS2, TRIM45, SCRN1,
CSNK1E, HBXIP, CSDE1, MRPL20, IKZF1, and COL20A1), and distinct survival patterns
were observed between the high- and low-risk groups from the combined dataset of 
408 microarrays. The risk score was significantly higher in breast cancer
patients with recurrence, metastasis, or mortality than in relapse-free
individuals (0.241 versus 0, P<0.001). The concurrent gene risk predictive model 
remained discriminative across distinct clinical ER and HER2 statuses in subgroup
analysis. Prognostic comparisons with published gene expression signatures showed
a better discerning ability of concurrent genes, many of which were rarely
identifiable if expression data were pre-selected by phenotype correlations or
variability of individual genes. We conclude that parallel analysis of CGH and
microarray data, in conjunction with known gene expression patterns, can be used 
to identify biomarkers with prognostic values in breast cancer.

Differentiation arrest is a hallmark of acute leukemia. Genomic alterations in B 
cell differentiation factors such as PAX5, IKZF1, and EBF-1 have been identified 
in more than half of all cases of childhood B precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). Here, we describe a perturbed epigenetic and transcriptional
regulation of ZNF423 in ALL as a novel mechanism interfering with B cell
differentiation. Hypomethylation of ZNF423 regulatory sequences and BMP2
signaling result in transactivation of ZNF423a and a novel ZNF423ß-isoform
encoding a nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex-interacting
domain. Aberrant ZNF423 inhibits the transactivation of EBF-1 target genes and
leads to B cell maturation arrest in vivo. Importantly, ZNF423 expression is
associated with poor outcome of ETV6-RUNX1-negative B precursor ALL patients. Our
work demonstrates that ALL is more than a genetic disease and that epigenetics
may uncover novel mechanisms of disease with prognostic implications.

Oncogenic subtypes in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(BCP-ALL) are used for risk stratification. However, a significant number of
BCP-ALL patients are still genetically unassigned. Using array-comparative
genomic hybridization in a selected BCP-ALL cohort, we characterized a recurrent 
V(D)J-mediated intragenic deletion of the ERG gene (ERG(del)). A
breakpoint-specific PCR assay was designed and used to screen an independent
non-selected cohort of 897 children aged 1-17 years treated for BCP-ALL in the
EORTC-CLG 58951 trial. ERG(del) was found in 29/897 patients (3.2%) and was
mutually exclusive of known classifying genetic lesions, suggesting that it
characterized a distinct leukemia entity. ERG(del) was associated with higher age
(median 7.0 vs. 4.0 years, P=0.004), aberrant CD2 expression (43.5% vs. 3.7%,
P<0.001) and frequent IKZF1 <U+0394>4-7 deletions (37.9% vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). However,
ERG(del) patients had a very good outcome, with an 8-year event-free survival
(8-y EFS) and an 8-year overall survival of 86.4% and 95.6%, respectively,
suggesting that the IKZF1 deletion had no impact on prognosis in this genetic
subtype. Accordingly, within patients with an IKZF1 <U+0394>4-7 deletion, those with
ERG(del) had a better outcome (8-y EFS: 85.7% vs. 51.3%; hazard ratio: 0.16; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.02-1.20; P=0.04). These findings have implications for
further stratification including IKZF1 status.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the isoforms of IKAROS in the bone marrow samples from
children with acute B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and to investigate
the relationship between frequency of dominant-negative (DN) IKAROS isoforms and 
prognosis of B-ALL, and to preliminarily study the relevant mechanism.
METHODS: A total of 137 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL, who sequentially
entered the Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical
Center between January 2005 and September 2010, were included in the study.
Nest-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and TA cloning were used to analyze the expression
of IKAROS isoforms in these children. The relationship between frequency of DN
IKAROS isoforms and prognosis of B-ALL was investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 137 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL, 16 had expression of
IK6, 14 had expression of IK4, and 2 had expression of IK7. There was significant
difference in 2.5-year event-free survival between the cohorts of DN IKAROS and
non-DN IKAROS (P=0.01). Analysis of the 10 paired of diagnosis/relapse samples
from 10 patients with recurrence showed that 8 of 10 paired diagnosis and relapse
samples had inconsistent expression of IKAROS isoforms. The rate of IK6
expression in relapse samples from 21 relapse ALL patients was significantly
higher than in the 137 children with newly diagnosed ALL (62% vs 12%, P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of DN IKAROS isoforms can be a poor prognostic factor in 
B-ALL and is closely associated with recurrence of B-ALL.

Identifying the downstream effects of disease-associated SNPs is challenging. To 
help overcome this problem, we performed expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) meta-analysis in non-transformed peripheral blood samples from 5,311
individuals with replication in 2,775 individuals. We identified and replicated
trans eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously
associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Some of these SNPs
affect multiple genes in trans that are known to be altered in individuals with
disease: rs4917014, previously associated with systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), altered gene expression of C1QB and five type I interferon response genes,
both hallmarks of SLE. DeepSAGE RNA sequencing showed that rs4917014 strongly
alters the 3' UTR levels of IKZF1 in cis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and
sequencing analysis of the trans-regulated genes implicated IKZF1 as the causal
gene. Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed 
similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into
the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants.

Ikaros is a critical regulator of lymphocyte development and homeostasis; thus,
understanding its transcriptional regulation is important from both developmental
and clinical perspectives. Using a mouse transgenic reporter approach, we
functionally characterized a network of highly conserved cis-acting elements at
the Ikzf1 locus. We attribute B-cell and myeloid but not T-cell specificity to
the main Ikzf1 promoter. Although this promoter was unable to counter local
chromatin silencing effects, each of the 6 highly conserved Ikzf1 intronic
enhancers alleviated silencing. Working together, the Ikzf1 enhancers provided
locus control region activity, allowing reporter expression in a position and
copy-independent manner. Only 1 of the Ikzf1 enhancers was responsible for the
progressive upregulation of Ikaros expression from hematopoietic stem cells to
lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors to T-cell precursors, which are stages of
differentiation dependent on Ikaros for normal outcome. Thus, Ikzf1 is regulated 
by both epigenetic and transcriptional factors that target its enhancers in both 
redundant and specific fashions to provide an expression profile supportive of
normal lymphoid lineage progression and homeostasis. Mutations in the Ikzf1
regulatory elements and their interacting factors are likely to have adverse
effects on lymphopoiesis and contribute to leukemogenesis.

Ikaros limits basophil development by suppressing C/EBP-a expression.

School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; and.

The Ikaros gene (Ikzf1) encodes a family of zinc-finger transcription factors
implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Here we show that Ikaros
suppresses the development of basophils, which are proinflammatory cells of the
myeloid lineage. In the absence of extrinsic basophil-inducing signals,
Ikaros(-/-) (Ik(-/-)) mice exhibit increases in basophil numbers in blood and
bone marrow and in their direct precursors in bone marrow and the spleen, as well
as decreased numbers of intestinal mast cells. In vitro culture of Ik(-/-) bone
marrow under mast cell differentiation conditions also results in predominance of
basophils. Basophil expansion is associated with an increase in basophil
progenitors, increased expression of Cebpa and decreased expression of mast
cell-specifying genes Hes1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
(Mitf). Ikaros directly associates with regulatory sites within Cebpa and Hes1
and regulates the acquisition of permissive H3K4 tri-methylation marks at the
Cebpa locus and reduces H3K4 tri-methylation at the Hes1 promoter. Ikaros
blockade in cultured cells or transfer of Ik(-/-) bone marrow into irradiated
Ik(+/+) recipients also results in increased basophils confirming a
cell-intrinsic effect of Ikaros on basophil development. We conclude that Ikaros 
is a suppressor of basophil differentiation under steady-state conditions and
that it acts by regulating permissive chromatin modifications of Cebpa.

Diminished Ikaros function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common form of childhood cancer.
Therefore, a stringent regulation of Ikaros is of paramount importance for normal
lymphocyte ontogeny. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence for a
previously unknown function of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a partner and
posttranslational regulator of Ikaros, a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding
protein that plays a pivotal role in immune homeostasis. We demonstrate that BTK 
phosphorylates Ikaros at unique phosphorylation sites S214 and S215 in the close 
vicinity of its zinc finger 4 (ZF4) within the DNA binding domain, thereby
augmenting its nuclear localization and sequence-specific DNA binding activity.
Our results further demonstrate that BTK-induced activating phosphorylation is
critical for the optimal transcription factor function of Ikaros.

Most relapses in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(BCP-ALL) are not predicted using current prognostic features. Here, we
determined the co-occurrence and independent prognostic relevance of 3 recently
identified prognostic features: BCR-ABL1-like gene signature, deletions in IKZF1,
and high CRLF2 messenger RNA expression (CRLF2-high). These features were
determined in 4 trials representing 1128 children with ALL: DCOG ALL-8, ALL9,
ALL10, and Cooperative ALL (COALL)-97/03. BCR-ABL1-like, IKZF1-deleted, and
CRLF2-high cases constitute 33.7% of BCR-ABL1-negative, MLL wild-type BCP-ALL
cases, of which BCR-ABL1-like and IKZF1 deletion (co)occurred most frequently.
Higher cumulative incidence of relapse was found for BCR-ABL1-like and
IKZF1-deleted, but not CRLF2-high, cases relative to remaining BCP-ALL cases,
reflecting the observations in each of the cohorts analyzed separately. No
relapses occurred among cases with CRLF2-high as single feature, whereas 62.9% of
all relapses in BCR-ABL1-negative, MLL wild-type BCP-ALL occurred in cases with
BCR-ABL1-like signature and/or IKZF1 deletion. Both the BCR-ABL1-like signature
and IKZF1 deletions were prognostic features independent of conventional
prognostic markers in a multivariate model, and both remained prognostic among
cases with intermediate minimal residual disease. The BCR-ABL1-like signature and
an IKZF1 deletion, but not CRLF2-high, are prognostic factors and are clinically 
of importance to identify high-risk patients who require more intensive and/or
alternative therapies.

Genetic alterations of Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), point
mutations in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and overexpression of cytokine receptor-like 
factor 2 (CRLF2) were recently reported to be associated with poor outcomes in
pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL. Herein, we conducted genetic analyses of
IKZF1 deletion, point mutation of JAK2 exon 16, 17, and 21, CRLF2 expression, the
presence of P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion and F232C mutation in CRLF2 in 202 pediatric
BCP-ALL patients newly diagnosed and registered in Japan Childhood Leukemia Study
ALL02 protocol to find out if alterations in these genes are determinants of poor
outcome. All patients showed good response to initial prednisolone (PSL)
treatment. Ph<U+207A>, infantile, and Down syndrome-associated ALL were excluded.
Deletion of IKZF1 occurred in 19/202 patients (9.4%) and CRLF2 overexpression
occurred in 16/107 (15.0%), which are similar to previous reports. Patients with 
IKZF1 deletion had reduced event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)
compared to those in patients without IKZF1 deletion (5-year EFS, 62.7% vs.
88.8%, 5-year OS, 71.8% vs. 90.2%). Our data also showed significantly inferior
5-year EFS (48.6% vs. 84.7%, log rank P = 0.0003) and 5-year OS (62.3% vs. 85.4%,
log rank P = 0.009) in NCI-HR patients (n = 97). JAK2 mutations and P2RY8-CRLF2
fusion were rarely detected. IKZF1 deletion was identified as adverse prognostic 
factor even in pediatric BCP-ALL in NCI-HR showing good response to PSL.

Routine application of a novel MLPA-based first-line screening test uncovers
clinically relevant copy number aberrations in haematological malignancies
undetectable by conventional cytogenetics.

OBJECTIVE: The presence of numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities 
is a frequent finding in clonal hematopoietic malignant disease, typically
diagnosed through routine karyotyping and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis. Recently, the application of array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) has uncovered many new cryptic genomic copy number
imbalances, most of which are now recognized as clinically useful markers of
haematological malignancies. In view of the limitations of both FISH and aCGH
techniques, in terms of their routine application as a first line screening test,
we designed a new multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probemix
for use in addition to classic karyotype analysis.
METHODS: A novel MLPA probemix was developed to interrogate copy number changes
involving chromosomal regions: 2p23-24 (MYCN, ALK), 5q32-34 (MIR145A, EBF1,
MIR146A), 6q21-27, 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 7q21-36, 8q24.21 (MYC), 9p24 (JAK2 V617F point
mutation), 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/2B), 9p13.2 (PAX5), 10q23 (PTEN), 11q22.3 (ATM),
12p13.2 (ETV6), 13q14 (RB1, MIR15A, DLEU2, DLEU1), 17p13.1 (TP53), and 21q22.1
(RUNX1/AML1) and was applied to DNA extracted from 313 consecutive bone marrow
patient samples, referred for routine karyotype analysis.
RESULTS: More than half of the samples originated from newly investigated
patients. We discovered clinically relevant genomic aberrations, involving a
total of 24 patients (8%) all with a normal karyotype, which would have remained 
undiagnosed.
DISCUSSION: Our data clearly indicate that routine application of this MLPA
screening panel, as an adjunct to karyotype analysis, provides a sensitive,
robust, rapid and low-cost approach for uncovering clinically important genomic
abnormalities, which would have otherwise remained undetected.

Hispanics.

Recent genome-wide studies conducted in European Whites have identified novel
susceptibility genes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought 
to examine whether these loci are susceptibility genes among Hispanics, whose
reported incidence of childhood ALL is the highest of all ethnic groups in
California, and whether their effects differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanic
Whites (NHWs). We genotyped 13 variants in these genes among 706 Hispanic (300
cases, 406 controls) and 594 NHW (225 cases, 369 controls) participants in a
matched population-based case-control study in California. We found significant
associations for the five studied ARID5B variants in both Hispanics (p values of 
1.0 × 10(-9) to 0.004) and NHWs (p values of 2.2 × 10(-6) to 0.018). Risk
estimates were in the same direction in both groups (ORs of 1.53-1.99 and
1.37-1.84, respectively) and strengthened when restricted to B-cell precursor
high-hyperdiploid ALL (>50 chromosomes; ORs of 2.21-3.22 and 1.67-2.71,
respectively). Similar results were observed for the single CEBPE variant.
Hispanics and NHWs exhibited different susceptibility loci at CDKN2A. Although
IKZF1 loci showed significant susceptibility effects among NHWs (p < 1 × 10(-5)),
their effects among Hispanics were in the same direction but nonsignificant,
despite similar minor allele frequencies. Future studies should examine whether
the observed effects vary by environmental, immunological, or lifestyle factors.

Despite the favorable prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 
a substantial subset of patients relapses. As this occurs not only in the high
risk but also in the standard/intermediate groups, the presently used risk
stratification is suboptimal. The underlying mechanisms for treatment failure
include the presence of genetic changes causing insensitivity to the therapy
administered. To identify relapse-associated aberrations, we performed
single-nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of 307 uniformly treated,
consecutive pediatric ALL cases accrued during 1992-2011. Recurrent aberrations
of 14 genes in patients who subsequently relapsed or had induction failure were
detected. Of these, deletions/uniparental isodisomies of ADD3, ATP10A, EBF1,
IKZF1, PAN3, RAG1, SPRED1 and TBL1XR1 were significantly more common in B-cell
precursor ALL patients who relapsed compared with those remaining in complete
remission. In univariate analyses, age (=10 years), white blood cell counts (>100
× 10(9)/l), t(9;22)(q34;q11), MLL rearrangements, near-haploidy and deletions of 
ATP10A, IKZF1, SPRED1 and the pseudoautosomal 1 regions on Xp/Yp were
significantly associated with decreased 10-year event-free survival, with IKZF1
abnormalities being an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis
irrespective of the risk group. Older age and deletions of IKZF1 and SPRED1 were 
also associated with poor overall survival. Thus, analyses of these genes provide
clinically important information.

This study was aimed to detect the expression of IKZF1 gene isoforms in bone
marrow cells of patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and to
investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with IK6
isoform. The expression of IKZF1 gene isoforms were measured by nested RT-PCR in 
79 newly diagnosed ALL patients. The clinical characteristics of IK6 positive
patients and overall survival, disease-free survival of the IK6 positive group
and IK6 negative group were compared. The results showed that IK1 and IK2/3 were 
the functional isoform while the IK4, IK6, IK8 and IK9 were the dominant negative
isoform in adult ALL. The dominant negative isoform IK6 accounted for 34.4% in
B-ALL patients and accounted for 22.2% in T-ALL patients. The BCR/ABL1 positive
rate and the percentage of high risk patients in IK6 positive group was higher
than that of IK6 negtive group in B-ALL patients (P = 0.027, P = 0.048). The
expression of IK6 isoform did not correlate with sex, age and WBC count of B-ALL 
and T-ALL patients. The overall survival and disease-free survival of IK6
positive group were both lower than that of IK6 negtive group in Ph negative
B-ALL patients (P = 0.009, P = 0.002). It is concluded that IK6 is a main isoform
of the expression of IKZF1 gene in adult ALL patients, and can be used as a
prognostic factor for guiding treatment in Ph negative B-ALL patients.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide analysis studies have demonstrated that IKZF1, CRLF2, and
JAK2 gene alterations correlate with poor prognosis in pediatric B-cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). However, the prognostic significance for 
these gene alterations has not been clarified in Japanese patients.
PROCEDURE: A total of 194 patients with BCP-ALL enrolled in the Japanese
Children's Cancer & Leukemia Study Group ALL 2004 clinical trial were assessed
for the presence of three different gene alterations: IKZF1 deletions, CRLF2
expression and JAK2 mutation.
RESULTS: IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2-high expression were identified in 22 of 177
(12%) patients and in 15 of 141 (11%) patients, respectively. However, JAK2 R683 
mutation was detected only one of 177 patients. The 4-year event-free survival
(4y-EFS) was different when comparing patients with or without IKZF1 deletions
(68.2% vs. 85.2%; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) and was also different when comparing patients with
different CRLF2 expression levels (high, 66.7% vs. low, 88.1%; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03). The
differences in 4y-EFS were statistically significant in patients with ALL in the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI)-high risk group (HR-ALL) (IKZF1 deletions: yes,
58.3% vs. no, 87.0%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02; CRLF2 expression: high, 55.6% vs. low, 85.3%,
P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) but not in patients with ALL in the NCI-standard risk group (SR-ALL;
IKZF1 deletions: yes, 80.0% vs. no, 84.4%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.75; CRLF2 expression: high,
83.3% vs. low, 89.2%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.77). Coexistence of IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2-high
expression associated with poor outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2-high expression predicted poor outcomes in
patients with HR-ALL but not in patients with SR-ALL in our Japanese cohort.

University, No, 79 Qing Chun Rd, Hangzhou 310003, China.

New genetic markers for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been found 
to have prognostic impact, such as the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1
alterations, which are associated with a high rate of leukemic relapse in B-ALL. 
Although complete remission rates by induction chemotherapy in ALL are now high, 
the long-term survival is still disappointing. Improvements in the survival
outcome of ALL have been observed in young adults as a result of the use of
pediatric inspired regimens and the broadening of the number of patients who are 
eligible for allogeneic SCT. Development of new and less toxic agents also
provide promise to improve the outcome in adult ALL, such as tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in Ph-positive ALL, rituximab in CD20-positive disease, blinatumomab
in precursor B-ALL and nelarabine in T-lineage ALL. Challenges for the future are
to implement genomic profiling into the clinical setting to guide risk
stratification and providing novel targets for tailored therapies.

Musashi-2 (MSI2) expression of 116 adult B-cells acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(B-ALL) patients was measured by real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that
patients with high MSI2 expression had inferior overall survival (OS) (P=0.004), 
event free survival (EFS) (P=0.001) and relapse free survival (RFS) (P=0.018) in 
BCR-ABL-negative B-ALL. Multivariate models revealed that, besides WBC more than 
30×10(9)/L and IK6 variant of IKZF1, high MSI2 expression was also an independent
prognostic factor for adult BCR-ABL-negative B-ALL. Our data suggest that high
MSI2 expression could indicate poor prognosis and facilitate risk and treatment
stratification in adult BCR-ABL-negative B-ALL.

Alterations in the IKZF1 gene are associated with poor prognosis in pediatric
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We examined the relationship between
IKZF1 alterations and clinical findings in 78 adult patients with B-ALL. Aberrant
isoforms of IKZF1 were detected using RT-PCR. The copy numbers of IKZF1 exons and
fusion genes caused by exon deletions were determined using RQ-PCR and genomic
PCR, respectively. We detected aberrant IKZF1 isoforms in 20 of the 78 patients
(13 Ik6 and seven Ik10) and deletions of the entire or parts of the IKZF1 gene in
40 of 70 patients. No IKZF1 point mutations were detected by direct sequencing.
Nineteen Ik6 and Ik10 isoforms had been generated through genomic exon deletions,
but one through aberrant splicing. In total, 41 of the 78 (52.6%) patients
harbored IKZF1 alterations, which were identified in 20 of 24 (83.3%) patients
with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive B-ALL compared with 21 of 54 (38.9%)
Ph-negative B-ALL (P = 0.0004). IKZF1 alterations are highly involved even in
adults with B-ALL. To fully detect IKZF1 alterations, several methods with
alternative approaches are required. To elucidate the clinical significance of
IKZF1 alterations in adult B-ALL, our study warrants prospective clinical studies
with a full analysis of IKZF1 alterations.

Diseases, , Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: To identify novel genetic candidates for systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) in the Korean population, and to validate the risk loci for SLE identified 
in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
METHODS: We performed a GWAS in 400 Korean female SLE patients and 445 controls. 
Selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were then replicated in an
independent cohort of 385 SLE patients and 583 controls (replication cohort 1),
and in a further 811 SLE patients and 1502 controls (replication cohort 2).
RESULTS: In the GWAS phase, rs9275428 located near HLA-DQB1 showed the strongest 
association with SLE (OR 0.50, false discovery rate (FDR) p=3.07×10(-6)).
Although no loci reached genome-wide significance outside major
histocompatibility complex (MHC), C8orf13-BLK, STAT4, CSMD1, DIAPH3, GLDC and
TNFSF4 showed FDR p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. Our results suggest that STAT4, BLK, IRF5,
PTTG1-miR-146a, UBE2L3 and TNFAIP3 are shared susceptibility loci among
Caucasians and Asians, while ETS1, IKZF1, SLC15A4 are likely to be Asian-specific
loci. In a combined analysis of 1596 SLE patients and 2540 controls for selected 
22 candidate SNP, STAT4 and BLK as positive controls showed a strong association 
with SLE (FDR p=9.85×10(-13) and 2.28×10(-8), respectively). Of these, 16
candidates (PEX5L, TRAJ50, MYO18B, SOS1, ARHGAP26, SMURF1, CADPS, HAND1, FAM78B, 
DIAPH3, TBL1XR1, CSMD1, ZBTB20, C3orf21, HIPK1 and AP001042.1) showed only
nominal significance (7.05×10(-4)=FDR p=4.38×10(-2)).
CONCLUSIONS: There are similarities and differences in genetic susceptibility for
SLE between Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups. Although 16 putative novel loci
for SLE have been suggested in the Korean population, further research on a
larger sample is required to discriminate truth from error.

Interactions between common germline variants in ARID5B and IKZF1 and other known
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk factors were queried using
biospecimens and data from 770 ALL cases and 384 controls. Case-control
comparisons revealed dose-dependent associations between ARID5B rs10821936,
ARID5B rs10994982, and IKZF1 rs11978267 and childhood ALL overall, and B lineage 
and B lineage hyperdiploid ALL examined separately (all allelic odds ratios
=1.33, Ptrend=0.001). No heterogeneity was observed between ORs for males and
females (all Pinteraction=0.48). Likewise, no significant genotype-birth weight
interactions were detected (all Pinteraction=0.12) among cases. These results
indicate similar ALL risk across strata of known risk factors.

Chromosomal translocations resulting in chimeric fusion genes are prototypic for 
pediatric leukemia patients. The most known fusions are ETV6-RUNX1 or BCR-ABL1 in
B-cell progenitor (BCP)-ALL, and rearrangements of MLL in pediatric ALL and AML. 
Genome-wide sequencing projects have revealed additional, recurrent gene
mutations in B cell malignancies. One of these mutations comprises the IKZF1
gene, encoding the IKAROS transcription factor which is one of the essential
transcription factors driving lymphoid development. IKZF1 deletions were first
identified by SNP arrays in ALL patients, and later identified with a high
prevalence in BCR-ABL1(+) patients. IKZF1 deletions turned out to be an
independent prognostic marker associated with a poor outcome. Here, we
characterized IKZF1 deletions in pediatric BCP-ALL patients by combining MLPA
mapping experiments with long distance inverse PCR. The aim of our study was also
to compare existing methods with our approach. Our attempt confirmed many of the 
existing data but revealed a more complex pattern of recombination sites,
including a total of 4 recombination hotspots. This extended knowledge was
translated into a novel, multiplex PCR assay that allows to perform IKZF1
deletion analyses by using a 2-tube PCR approach.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focus on childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children younger than
15 years old, have found evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
IKZF1 (7p12.2), ARID5B (10q21.2) and CEBPE (14q11.2) are strongly related to the 
risk of childhood ALL. These polymorphisms may lead to abnormal expression and
dysfunction of the corresponding transcription factors and are likely to increase
the risk of ALL. To validate the relationship between these SNPs and the risk of 
childhood ALL in Chinese population, we conducted a case-control study of 570 ALL
cases and 673 controls. We determined that the SNP rs10821936 in ARID5B was
statistically significantly associated with the risk of childhood ALL (P<0.0001).
The results were also significant for the subgroup analysis of high-risk,
medium-risk and low-risk ALL as well as B-lineage ALL. Statistically significant 
differences were not found in the SNPs for IKZF1 and CEBPE. In conclusion, ARID5B
rs10821936 could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of
childhood ALL in Chinese children.

Contemporary treatments have resulted in 5-year event-free survival rates (EFS)
of approximately 75% to 80% for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Relapses of ALL in children were more often in HR-ALL but also in very few
non-HR-ALL. Thus current clinical study of ALL has focused on improving the
outcome of a few subtypes of HR-ALL. Infants with ALL have a particularly high
risk of treatment failure. Infant ALL Interfant-99 study found that MLL
rearrangement, age younger than 6 months, poor response to a prednisone prophase 
and high WBC count were strong independent predictive factors for poor prognosis 
in infants with ALL. Treatments with hybrid protocol, including both lymphoid-
and myeloid-directed treatment elements, also contain HD-MTX and high dose
Ara-C(HD-Ara-C), will further improve the outcome for infant ALL. Children
Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Ph+ALL) was associated with a high relapse 
rate when treated with chemotherapy alone. The Children's Oncology Group (COG)
AALL0031 trial showed that the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs)
imatinib to intensive chemotherapy resulted in 3-year EFS more than historical
control treated with chemotherapy alone. These findings create a new paradigm for
integrating molecularly targeted agents with intensified chemotherapy. Children
with T-ALL have had a worse outcome than with the precursor B-cell ALL
previously. With more intensified chemotherapy , outcomes for children T-ALL were
improved, approaching those for the precursor B-cell ALL. Recently, COG decided
to treat children with T-cell ALL with separate protocols different from those
for the precursor B-cell ALL, and the protocols of BFM for children with T-ALL
have been the same as those of the precursor B-cell ALL. Early precursor T-cell
ALL, a novel subtype of T-cell ALL, was identified by gene expression profiling, 
flow cytometry, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses. ETP-ALL,
identified in 13% of T-cell ALL cases, is characterized by a distinctive
immunophenotype (CD1a and CD8 negativity, with weak expression of CD5 and
co-expression of stem cell or myeloid markers). A retrospective analysis
suggested that ETP-ALL had a poor prognosis. The advent of high-resolution
genome-wide analyses has provided new insights into leukemogenesis and identified
many novel subtypes of leukemia. Ph-like ALL (BCR-ABL1-like ALL) patients lack a 
previously identified chromosomal rearrangement, but exhibit a gene-expression
profile highly similar to that of Ph+ALL, and often have deletion/mutation of
IKZF1, CRLF2 rearrangments and JAK1/2sequence mutations which are also common in 
Ph+ALL. The prognosis of Ph-like ALL is poor. Development of new agents targeted 
to leukemogenic pathways will promise to further improve the outcome of children 
ALL.

New prognostic markers are needed for upfront identification of patients with
acute lymphocytic leukemia with a high risk of relapse or who are not likely to
respond to the most aggressive chemotherapy. We focused our analysis on Ikaros
(IKZF1) gene deletions in a homogeneous cohort of 410 pediatric patients with
Philadelphia chromosome-negative, B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
enrolled in Italy into the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 study. We confirm their reported
poor prognostic value, although the associated event-free survival was relatively
high (approximately 70%). The difference in the cumulative incidence of relapse
between patients positive or not for IKZF1 deletions was not marked: 24.2% (5.9) 
versus 13.1% (1.8) overall and 23.9% (6.6) versus 16.5% (2.5) in the
intermediate-risk subgroup. In line with this, IKZF1 deletions were not an
independent prognostic factor for the hazard of relapse. Most IKZF1-deleted cases
stratified in the high-risk group relapsed, suggesting that once identified,
patients with these deletions require an alternative treatment. In conclusion,
the need of and benefit from introducing IKZF1 deletions as an additional
stratification marker for patients with Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain questionable.

Ikaros, encoded by the IKZF1 gene, is a pivotal transcription factor whose
expression and utilization is dynamically altered during hematopoietic
development. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of
the IKZF1 gene are unclear in lung cancer cell lines. Here we show the role of
Ikaros in a cohort of grade IIIA lung cancer patients, with particular emphasis
on its relationship with clinical outcomes and expression levels. The expression 
levels of Ikaros were positively correlated with the prognosis in the lung cancer
patients. We also demonstrated that Ikaros expression is ectopically activated in
a panel of lung cancer cell lines primarily through demethylation of its
promoter. Moreover, gain-of-function experiments revealed that Ikaros inhibits
migration and invasion of lung cancer cells in vitro. Our results thus shed light
on how Ikaros can act as a lineage competency factor to facilitate lung cancer
progression.

Genomic instability is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase
(CML-CP) resulting in BCR-ABL1 mutations encoding resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) and/or additional chromosomal aberrations leading to disease
relapse and/or malignant progression. TKI-naive and TKI-treated leukemia stem
cells (LSCs) and leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs) accumulate high levels of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative DNA damage. To determine the role of 
TKI-refractory LSCs in genomic instability, we used a murine model of CML-CP
where ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage was elevated in LSCs, including quiescent 
LSCs, but not in LPCs. ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage in LSCs caused clinically
relevant genomic instability in CML-CP-like mice, such as TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 
mutations (E255K, T315I, H396P), deletions in Ikzf1 and Trp53, and additions in
Zfp423 and Idh1. Despite inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase, imatinib did not
downregulate ROS and oxidative DNA damage in TKI-refractory LSCs to the levels
detected in normal cells, and CML-CP-like mice treated with imatinib continued to
accumulate clinically relevant genetic aberrations. Inhibition of class I
p21-activated protein kinases by IPA3 downregulated ROS in TKI-naive and
TKI-treated LSCs. Altogether, we postulate that genomic instability may originate
in the most primitive TKI-refractory LSCs in TKI-naive and TKI-treated patients.

The BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, usually carried by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)
resulting from t(9;22)(q34;q11) or variants, is pathognomonic for chronic myeloid
leukaemia (CML). It is also occasionally found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
(ALL) mostly in adults and rarely in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Array
Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) was used to study six Ph(+)AML, three
bi-lineage and four Ph(+)ALL searching for specific genomic profiles.
Surprisingly, loss of the IKZF1 and/or CDKN2A genes, the hallmark of Ph(+)ALL,
were recurrent findings in Ph(+)AML and accompanied cryptic deletions within the 
immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes. The latter two losses have been shown
to be part of 'hot spot' genome imbalances associated with BCR/ABL1 positive
pre-B lymphoid phenotype in CML and Ph(+)ALL. We applied Significance Analysis of
Microarrays (SAM) to data from the 'hot spot' regions to the Ph(+)AML and a
further 40 BCR/ABL1(+) samples looking for differentiating features. After
exclusion of the most dominant markers, SAM identified aberrations unique to de
novo Ph(+)AML that involved relevant genes. While the biological and clinical
significance of this specific genome signature remains to be uncovered, the
unique loss within the immunoglobulin genes provides a simple test to enable the 
differentiation of clinically similar de novo Ph(+) AML and myeloid blast crisis 
of CML.

BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in
children and the incidence of ALL varies by ethnicity. Although accumulating
evidence indicates inherited predisposition to ALL, the genetic basis of ALL
susceptibility in diverse ancestry has not been comprehensively examined.
METHODS: We performed a multiethnic genome-wide association study in 1605
children with ALL and 6661 control subjects after adjusting for population
structure, with validation in three replication series of 845 case subjects and
4316 control subjects. Association was tested by two-sided logistic regression.
RESULTS: A novel ALL susceptibility locus at 10p12.31-12.2 (BMI1-PIP4K2A,
rs7088318, P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) was identified in the genome-wide association
study, with independent replication in European Americans, African Americans, and
Hispanic Americans (P = .001, .009, and .04, respectively). Association was also 
validated at four known ALL susceptibility loci: ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and
CDKN2A/2B. Associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants were
consistent across ethnicity, with multiple independent signals at IKZF1 and
BMI1-PIP4K2A loci. The frequency of ARID5B and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants differed by 
ethnicity, in parallel with ethnic differences in ALL incidence. Suggestive
evidence for modifying effects of age on genetic predisposition to ALL was also
observed. ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants cumulatively conferred 
strong predisposition to ALL, with children carrying six to eight copies of risk 
alleles at a ninefold (95% confidence interval = 6.9 to 11.8) higher ALL risk
relative to those carrying zero to one risk allele at these four single
nucleotide polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate strong associations between inherited
genetic variation and ALL susceptibility in children and shed new light on ALL
molecular etiology in diverse ancestry.

In childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cytogenetics is
important in diagnosis and as an indicator of response to therapy, thus playing a
key role in risk stratification of patients for treatment. Little is known of the
relationship between different cytogenetic subtypes in B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and the recently reported copy number abnormalities
affecting significant leukemia associated genes. In a consecutive series of 1427 
childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we have
determined the incidence and type of copy number abnormalities using multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification. We have shown strong links between
certain deletions and cytogenetic subtypes, including the novel association
between RB1 deletions and intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21. In
this study, we characterized the different copy number abnormalities and show
heterogeneity of PAX5 and IKZF1 deletions and the recurrent nature of RB1
deletions. Whole gene losses are often indicative of larger deletions, visible by
conventional cytogenetics. An increased number of copy number abnormalities is
associated with NCI high risk, specifically deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B,
which occur more frequently among these patients. IKZF1 deletions and
rearrangements of CRLF2 among patients with undefined karyotypes may point to the
poor risk BCR-ABL1-like group. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated in a
large representative cohort of children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia that the pattern of copy number abnormalities is highly variable
according to the primary genetic abnormality.

Mouse Lymphoblastic Leukemias Induced by Aberrant Prdm14 Expression Demonstrate
Widespread Copy Number Alterations Also Found in Human ALL.

Aberrant expression and activation of oncogenes in somatic cells has been
associated with cancer initiation. Required for reacquisition of pluripotency in 
the developing germ cell, PRDM14 initiates lymphoblastic leukemia when
misexpressed in murine bone marrow. Activation of pluripotency in somatic cells
can lead to aneuploidy and copy number alterations during iPS cell generation,
and we hypothesized that PRDM14-induced lymphoblastic leukemias would demonstrate
significant chromosomal damage. High-resolution oligo array comparative genomic
hybridization demonstrated infrequent aneuploidy but frequent amplification and
deletion, with amplifications occurring in a 5:1 ratio with deletions. Many
deletions (i.e., Cdkn2a, Ebf1, Pax5, Ikzf1) involved B-cell development genes and
tumor suppressor genes, recapitulating deletions occurring in human leukemia.
Pathways opposing senescence were frequently deactivated via Cdkn2a deletion or
Tbx2 amplification, with corollary gene expression. Additionally, gene expression
studies of abnormal pre-leukemic B-precursors showed downregulation of genes
involved in chromosomal stability (i.e., Xrcc6) and failure to upregulate DNA
repair pathways. We propose a model of leukemogenesis, triggered by pluripotency 
genes like Prdm14, which involves ongoing DNA damage and failure to activate
non-homologous end-joining secondary to aberrant gene expression.

The mechanism of bone marrow relapse in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia
has been deeply researched in recent years. The roles of hematopoietic stem
cells, some gene abnormalities including IKZF1, JAK, CRLF2 and CREBBP, as well as
mutation of genes influencing drug resistance have been confirmed to related with
relapse of disease. The microRNAs, gene expression profile of patient,
microenvironment of bone marrow including bone marrow fibrosis, mesenchymal stem 
cells and matrix metalloprotease, also play an important role in the process of
leukemia recurrence. This article reviewed the details mentioned above.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease and the
principal cause of neurological disability in young adults. Recent microarray
gene expression profiling studies have identified several genetic variants
contributing to the complex pathogenesis of MS, however, expressional and
functional studies are still required to further understand its molecular
mechanism. The present study aimed to analyze the molecular mechanism of MS using
microarray analysis combined with bioinformatics techniques. We downloaded the
gene expression profile of MS from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and analysed the
microarray data using the differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs) and links
package in R and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery.
The regulatory impact factor (RIF) algorithm was used to measure the impact
factor of transcription factor. A total of 1,297 DCGs between MS patients and
healthy controls were identified. Functional annotation indicated that these DCGs
were associated with immune and neurological functions. Furthermore, the RIF
result suggested that IKZF1, BACH1, CEBPB, EGR1, FOS may play central regulatory 
roles in controlling gene expression in the pathogenesis of MS. Our findings
confirm the presence of multiple molecular alterations in MS and indicate the
possibility for identifying prognostic factors associated with MS pathogenesis.

Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by
modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG 
glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After
isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of
N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247
individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured
IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of
1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results
identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P<2.27 × 10(-9)) in the discovery
analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. 
Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, 
and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously
implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3,
SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated
with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, 
rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1,
multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or
haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and
multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1
knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as
identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG
N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101
cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial
discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our 
study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation
of a single plasma protein using GWAS. The results may also provide an
explanation for the reported pleiotropy and antagonistic effects of loci involved
in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.

The Ikaros transcription factor is crucial for many aspects of hematopoiesis.
Loss of function mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding Ikaros, have been
implicated in adult and pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).
These mutations result in haploinsufficiency of the Ikaros gene in approximately 
half of the cases. The remaining cases contain more severe or compound mutations 
that lead to the generation of dominant-negative proteins or complete loss of
function. All IKZF1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. Here we
review the current genetic, clinical and mechanistic evidence for the role of
Ikaros as a tumor suppressor in B-ALL.

The transcription factor Ikaros regulates the development of hematopoietic cells.
Ikaros-deficient animals fail to develop B cells and display a T-cell malignancy,
which is correlated with altered Notch signaling. Recently, loss of Ikaros was
associated with progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid
leukemia and increasing evidence shows that Ikaros is also critical for the
regulation of myeloid development. Previous studies showed that Ikaros-deficient 
mice have increased megakaryopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism of this
phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we show that Ikaros overexpression decreases
NOTCH-induced megakaryocytic specification, and represses expression of several
megakaryocytic genes including GATA-1 to block differentiation and terminal
maturation. We also demonstrate that Ikaros expression is differentially
regulated by GATA-2 and GATA-1 during megakaryocytic differentiation and reveal
that the combined loss of Ikzf1 and Gata1 leads to synthetic lethality in vivo
associated with prominent defects in erythroid cells and an expansion of
megakaryocyte progenitors. Taken together, our observations demonstrate an
important functional interplay between Ikaros, GATA factors, and the NOTCH
signaling pathway in specification and homeostasis of the megakaryocyte lineage.

Ikaros family DNA-binding proteins are critical regulators of B-cell development.
Because the current knowledge of Ikaros targets in B-cell progenitors is limited,
we have identified genes that are bound and regulated by Ikaros in pre-B cells.
To elucidate the role of Ikaros in B-cell lineage specification and
differentiation, we analyzed the differential expression of Ikaros targets during
the progression of multipotent to lymphoid-restricted progenitors, B- and T-cell 
lineage specification, and progression along the B-cell lineage. Ikaros targets
accounted for one-half of all genes up-regulated during B-cell lineage
specification in vivo, explaining the essential role of Ikaros in this process.
Expression of the Ikaros paralogs Ikzf1 and Ikzf3 increases incrementally during 
B-cell progenitor differentiation, and, remarkably, inducible Ikaros expression
in cycling pre-B cells was sufficient to drive transcriptional changes resembling
the differentiation of cycling to resting pre-Bcells in vivo. The data suggest
that Ikaros transcription factor dosage drives the progression of progenitors
along a predetermined lineage by regulating multiple targets in key pathways,
including pre-Bcell receptor signaling, cell cycle progression, and lymphocyte
receptor rearrangement.Our approachmay be of general use to map the contribution 
of transcription factors to cell lineage commitment and differentiation.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted in Asian populations
have identified novel risk loci for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we 
genotyped 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight such loci and
investigated their disease associations in three independent Caucasian SLE
case-control cohorts recruited from Sweden, Finland and the United States. The
disease associations of the SNPs in ETS1, IKZF1, LRRC18-WDFY4, RASGRP3, SLC15A4, 
TNIP1 and 16p11.2 were replicated, whereas no solid evidence of association was
observed for the 7q11.23 locus in the Caucasian cohorts. SLC15A4 was
significantly associated with renal involvement in SLE. The association of TNIP1 
was more pronounced in SLE patients with renal and immunological disorder, which 
is corroborated by two previous studies in Asian cohorts. The effects of all the 
associated SNPs, either conferring risk for or being protective against SLE, were
in the same direction in Caucasians and Asians. The magnitudes of the allelic
effects for most of the SNPs were also comparable across different ethnic groups.
On the contrary, remarkable differences in allele frequencies between Caucasian
and Asian populations were observed for all associated SNPs. In conclusion, most 
of the novel SLE risk loci identified by GWASs in Asian populations were also
associated with SLE in Caucasian populations. We observed both similarities and
differences with respect to the effect sizes and risk allele frequencies across
ethnicities.

Several confirmed genetic susceptibility loci involved in the interferon
signaling and Th17/B cell response for SLE in Chinese Han populations have been
described. Available data also indicate that sex-specific genetic differences
contribute to SLE susceptibility. The aim of this study was to test for
gene-gene/gene-sex epistasis (interactions) in these known lupus susceptibility
loci. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MiR146a, IRF5, IKZF1, ETS1
and IL21 were genotyped by Sequenom MassArray system. A total of 1,825 subjects
(858 SLE patients and 967 controls) were included in the final analysis.
Epistasis was tested by additive model, multiplicative model and multifactor
dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Additive interaction analysis revealed
interactions between IRF5 and IKZF1 (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.48-3.44 [P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.21×10(4)]).
A similar tendency was also observed between IL21 and ETS1 by parametric methods.
In addition, multiple high dimensional gene-gene or gene-sex interactions
(three-and four-way) were identified by MDR analysis. Our study identified novel 
gene-gene/gene-sex interactions in lupus. Furthermore, these findings highlight
sex, interferon pathway, and Th17/B cells as important contributors to the
pathogenesis of SLE.

Genomic profiling has transformed our understanding of the genetic basis of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent years have seen a shift from microarray
analysis and candidate gene sequencing to next-generation sequencing. Together,
these approaches have shown that many ALL subtypes are characterized by
constellations of structural rearrangements, submicroscopic DNA copy number
alterations, and sequence mutations, several of which have clear implications for
risk stratification and targeted therapeutic intervention. Mutations in genes
regulating lymphoid development are a hallmark of ALL, and alterations of the
lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS) are associated with a high risk
of treatment failure in B-ALL. Approximately 20% of B-ALL cases harbor genetic
alterations that activate kinase signaling that may be amenable to treatment with
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including rearrangements of the cytokine receptor
gene CRLF2; rearrangements of ABL1, JAK2, and PDGFRB; and mutations of JAK1 and
JAK2. Whole-genome sequencing has also identified novel targets of mutation in
aggressive T-lineage ALL, including hematopoietic regulators (ETV6 and RUNX1),
tyrosine kinases, and epigenetic regulators. Challenges for the future are to
comprehensively identify and experimentally validate all genetic alterations
driving leukemogenesis and treatment failure in childhood and adult ALL and to
implement genomic profiling into the clinical setting to guide risk
stratification and targeted therapy.

One recently identified subtype of pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) has been termed BCR-ABL1-like or Ph-like because of similarity of 
the gene expression profile to BCR-ABL1 positive ALL suggesting the presence of
lesions activating tyrosine kinases, frequent alteration of IKZF1, and poor
outcome. Prior studies demonstrated that approximately half of these patients had
genomic lesions leading to CRLF2 overexpression, with half of such cases
harboring somatic mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2. To determine
whether mutations in other tyrosine kinases might also occur in ALL, we sequenced
the tyrosine kinome and downstream signaling genes in 45 high-risk pediatric ALL 
cases with either a Ph-like gene expression profile or other alterations
suggestive of activated kinase signaling. Aside from JAK mutations and 1 FLT3
mutation, no somatic mutations were found in any other tyrosine kinases,
suggesting that alternative mechanisms are responsible for activated kinase
signaling in high-risk ALL.

This study aimed to develop a novel multiplex reverse transcription-nested
polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) assay to accurately and effectively detect 10
common gene rearrangements in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to
examine the clinicopathologic characteristics and other genetic aberrations of
patients with ALL expressing different fusion genes. Our RT-nPCR assay had a
positive detection rate of 35.15% (90/256) for the 10 fusion genes. BCR-ABL1,
FUS-ERG, MLL-AF4, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, dupMLL, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, SET-NUP214 and
SIL-TAL1 were detected in 36 (14.06%), 14 (5.47%), 14 (5.47%), four (1.56%), four
(1.56%), five (1.95%), four (1.56%), two (0.78%), two (0.78%) and five patients
(1.95%), respectively. The RT-nPCR results were further confirmed by split-out
PCR, and cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
revealed corresponding translocations and fusions in 63 and 74 cases,
respectively. JAK2 and IKZF1 mutations were commonly detected in patients with
BCR-ABL1 ALL, and HOX overexpression was highly correlated with MLL fusions and
SET-NUP214. This study demonstrates that RT-nPCR is an effective method for
identifying 10 gene rearrangements in adult ALL, and it could potentially be
developed for diagnostic use and prognostic studies of ALL.

The IK6 isoform plays an important role in Philadelphia chromosome-positive adult
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL). This study was designed to monitor the
expression of the IK6 isoform with associated cytogenetic and molecular
abnormalities. The IK6 isoform, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities were
detected in 100 Chinese patients with de novo Ph+ adult ALL. Expression levels of
the IK6 isoform and BCR-ABL1 transcripts were monitored during treatment.
BCR-ABL1 mutation was identified in 45 paired samples. Strong correlations were
found between the expression status of the IK6 isoform and blast cells,
additional cytogenetic abnormalities, BCR-ABL1 transcripts, increased risk of
relapse, shorter relapse-free survival and overall survival at diagnosis. Higher 
frequencies of single IK6 expression and ABL mutation, including the types and
shifts thereof, were confirmed in relapsed patients. Furthermore, expression of
the IK6 isoform was dynamically consistent with BCR-ABL1 transcript levels during
treatment in the single expression group, whereas no such correlation was
observed in the co-expression group. The expression pattern of the IK6 isoform
was altered in three patients from the co-expression group. The findings of this 
study in Chinese patients with Ph+ adult ALL exhibit some discrepancies with data
reported in other countries, thereby enhancing current knowledge on the
therapeutic response and prognosis of this disease.

Deletion of the Ikaros (IKZF1) gene is an oncogenic lesion frequently associated 
with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemias. It is also found in a
fraction of BCR-ABL1-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and
early studies showed it was associated with a higher risk of relapse. Therefore, 
screening tools are needed for evaluation in treatment protocols and possible
inclusion in risk stratification. Besides monosomy 7 and large 7p abnormalities
encompassing IKZF1, most IKZF1 alterations are short, intragenic deletions. Based
on cohorts of patients, we mapped the microdeletion breakpoints and developed a
breakpoint-specific fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction that allows
detection of recurrent intragenic deletions. This sensitive test could also
detect IKZF1 subclonal deletions, whose prognostic significance should be
evaluated. Moreover, we show that consensus breakpoint sequences can be used as

for translational studies and in clinical management of BCP-ALL.

B-lineage transcription factors and cooperating gene lesions required for
leukemia development.

Differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into B lymphocytes requires the
concerted action of specific transcription factors, such as RUNX1, IKZF1, E2A,
EBF1 and PAX5. As key determinants of normal B-cell development, B-lineage
transcription factors are frequently deregulated in hematological malignancies,
such as B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), and affected by 
either chromosomal translocations, gene deletions or point mutations. However,
genetic aberrations in this developmental pathway are generally insufficient to
induce BCP-ALL, and often complemented by genetic defects in cytokine receptors
and tyrosine kinases (IL-7Ra, CRLF2, JAK2 and c-ABL1), transcriptional cofactors 
(TBL1XR1, CBP and BTG1), as well as the regulatory pathways that mediate
cell-cycle control (pRB and INK4A/B). Here we provide a detailed overview of the 
genetic pathways that interact with these B-lineage specification factors, and
describe how mutations affecting these master regulators together with
cooperating lesions drive leukemia development.

Discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation in the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)
essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis
(PMF) has stimulated great interest in the underlying molecular mechanisms and
treatment of these diseases. Along with acceleration of technologies, novel
mutations in genes such as MPL, LNK, and CBL have been discovered that converge
on the JAK-STAT pathway. Several additional novel mutations in genes involved in 
epigenetic regulation of the genome, including TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, and IDH1/2,
have emerged, in addition to several mutations in cellular splicing machinery.
While understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these novel mutations in
MPNs has improved, it is still lagging behind the pace of mutation discovery.
Concurrent with molecular discoveries, especially with regard to JAK-STAT
signaling, therapeutic development has accelerated in recent years. More than ten
JAK kinase inhibitors have been advanced into clinical trials. Recently the first
JAK2 inhibitor was approved for use in patients with PMF. Most JAK-targeting
agents share similar characteristics with regard to clinical benefit, consisting 
of improvements in splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and cytopenias, for
example. It remains to be determined if JAK2 inhibitors can considerably impact
disease progression and bone marrow histologic features (e.g., fibrosis) or
significantly impact the JAK2 allele burden. While JAK2 inhibitors appear to be
promising in PV and ET, they need to be compared with standard therapies, such as
hydroxyurea or interferon-based therapies. Future clinical development will focus
on optimal combination partners and agents that target alternative mechanisms,
deepen the response, and achieve molecular remissions.

BACKGROUND: We carried out a candidate gene association study in pediatric acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to identify possible genetic risk factors in a
Hungarian population.
METHODS: The results were evaluated with traditional statistical methods and with
our newly developed Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of
relevance (BN-BMLA) method. We collected genomic DNA and clinical data from 543
children, who underwent chemotherapy due to ALL, and 529 healthy controls.
Altogether 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 candidate genes were
genotyped.
RESULTS: With logistic regression, we identified 6 SNPs in the ARID5B and IKZF1
genes associated with increased risk to B-cell ALL, and two SNPs in the STAT3
gene, which decreased the risk to hyperdiploid ALL. Because the associated SNPs
were in linkage in each gene, these associations corresponded to one signal per
gene. The odds ratio (OR) associated with the tag SNPs were: OR = 1.69, P =
2.22x10(-7) for rs4132601 (IKZF1), OR = 1.53, P = 1.95x10(-5) for rs10821936
(ARID5B) and OR = 0.64, P = 2.32x10(-4) for rs12949918 (STAT3). With the BN-BMLA 
we confirmed the findings of the frequentist-based method and received additional
information about the nature of the relations between the SNPs and the disease.
E.g. the rs10821936 in ARID5B and rs17405722 in STAT3 showed a weak interaction, 
and in case of T-cell lineage sample group, the gender showed a weak interaction 
with three SNPs in three genes. In the hyperdiploid patient group the BN-BMLA
detected a strong interaction among SNPs in the NOTCH1, STAT1, STAT3 and BCL2
genes. Evaluating the survival rate of the patients with ALL, the BN-BMLA showed 
that besides risk groups and subtypes, genetic variations in the BAX and CEBPA
genes might also influence the probability of survival of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirmed the roles of genetic variations in
ARID5B and IKZF1 in the susceptibility to B-cell ALL. With the newly developed
BN-BMLA method several gene-gene, gene-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype
connections were revealed. We showed several advantageous features of the new
method, and suggested that in gene association studies the BN-BMLA might be a
useful supplementary to the traditional frequentist-based statistical method.

BACKGROUND: Recently, several studies have demonstrated a negative prognostic
impact of Ikaros (IKZF1) gene alterations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
However, controversies still exist regarding the impact of IKZF1 in current
treatment protocols.
PROCEDURE: We simultaneously detected IKZF1 gene deletions by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification and gene expression of IKZF1 isoforms in
206 children with BCR/ABL-negative ALL treated with ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocol, in 
which risk stratification was not based on minimal residual disease (MRD), and
validated the results on a cohort of 189 patients treated with MRD-directed
ALL-BFM 2000 protocol.
RESULTS: Deletion of IKZF1 was present in 14 of 206 (7%) ALL IC patients.
Interestingly, gene expression did not completely correlate with the deletion
status in either cohort. Deletions were not always reflected in the gene
expression of dominant-negative isoforms, and conversely, 7 of 395 (2%)
non-deleted cases overexpressed dominant-negative isoform Ik6. IKZF1 deletions
significantly affected event-free survival (EFS) of the ALL IC cohort (41<U+2009>±<U+2009>14%
vs. 86<U+2009>±<U+2009>3%, P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). Regarding IKZF1 isoforms, only Ik6 overexpression had
negative prognostic impact (EFS 50<U+2009>±<U+2009>16% vs. 85<U+2009>±<U+2009>3%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003). In multivariate
analysis, which included ALL IC risk criteria, flow-cytometric MRD and IKZF1
alterations, day 15 MRD and IKZF1 deletion status displayed an independent
prognostic impact.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that MRD-directed treatment diminishes prognostic impact of 
IKZF1 alterations. However, IKZF1 status alone or combined with day 15 flow
cytometry can significantly improve risk stratification within BFM protocols at
centers that do not perform antigen-receptor-based MRD monitoring.

This study was aimed to investigate the expression characteristics of two
transcriptional factors in Ikaros family, Ikaros and Helios isoforms and their
mechanism, as well as their correlation with clinical parameters, which play
important roles in transcriptional regulation of hematopoiesis. Expression of
Ikaros and Helios isoforms in a total of 163 patients with leukemia and
correlations between Ikaros and Helios isoforms were analyzed by PCR. The results
showed that different expression patters of Ikaros and Helios isoforms existed in
leukemia patients, that is, Ikaros isoform (Ik-6) was predominantly expressed in 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with BCR/ABL fusion gene, while Helios isoform
(He-i) was overexpressed in T-cell ALL patients. The results of cloning and
sequencing demonstrated that the isoforms of Ikaros and Helios had different
genetic alterations. The statistical correlation between these two isoforms not
was found in this study, although interaction between Ikaros and Helios has been 
reported. It is concluded that although Ikaros and Helios belong to the same
family with similar structure of zinc fingers, their isoforms have different
expression profile, specific genetic alterations, and different clinical
relevance in patients with leukemia. The connection and interaction between Ik-6 
and He-i needs further research.

Genomic profiling has identified a subtype of high-risk B-progenitor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with alteration of IKZF1, a gene expression
profile similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL and poor outcome (Ph-like ALL). The
genetic alterations that activate kinase signaling in Ph-like ALL are poorly
understood. We performed transcriptome and whole genome sequencing on 15 cases of
Ph-like ALL and identified rearrangements involving ABL1, JAK2, PDGFRB, CRLF2,
and EPOR, activating mutations of IL7R and FLT3, and deletion of SH2B3, which
encodes the JAK2-negative regulator LNK. Importantly, several of these
alterations induce transformation that is attenuated with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, suggesting the treatment outcome of these patients may be improved
with targeted therapy.

The study aimed to identify genetic lesions associated with secondary acute
myeloid leukemia (sAML) in comparison with AML arising de novo (dnAML) and assess
their impact on patients' overall survival (OS). High-resolution genotyping and
loss of heterozygosity mapping was performed on DNA samples from 86 sAML and 117 
dnAML patients, using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. Genes TP53,
RUNX1, CBL, IDH1/2, NRAS, NPM1, and FLT3 were analyzed for mutations in all
patients. We identified 36 recurrent cytogenetic aberrations (more than five
events). Mutations in TP53, 9pUPD, and del7q (targeting CUX1 locus) were
significantly associated with sAML, while NPM1 and FLT3 mutations associated with
dnAML. Patients with sAML carrying TP53 mutations demonstrated lower 1-year OS
rate than those with wild-type TP53 (14.3% ± 9.4% vs. 35.4% ± 7.2%; P = 0.002),
while complex karyotype, del7q (CUX1) and del7p (IKZF1) showed no significant
effect on OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that mutant TP53 was the only
independent adverse prognostic factor for OS in sAML (hazard ratio 2.67; 95% CI: 
1.33-5.37; P = 0.006). Patients with dnAML and complex karyotype carried
sAML-associated defects (TP53 defects in 54.5%, deletions targeting FOXP1 and
ETV6 loci in 45.4% of the cases). We identified several co-occurring lesions
associated with either sAML or dnAML diagnosis. Our data suggest that distinct
genetic lesions drive leukemogenesis in sAML. High karyotype complexity of sAML
patients does not influence OS. Somatic mutations in TP53 are the only
independent adverse prognostic factor in sAML. Patients with dnAML and complex
karyotype show genetic features associated with sAML and myeloproliferative
neoplasms.

IKZF1 gene deletions have been associated with a poor outcome in pediatric
precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To assess the prognostic relevance
of IKZF1 deletions for patients treated on Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster Study Group
trial ALL-BFM 2000, we screened 694 diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukemia
samples by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. Patients whose
leukemic cells bore IKZF1 deletions had a lower 5-year event-free survival
(0.69±0.05 vs. 0.85±0.01; P<0.0001) compared to those without, mainly due to a
higher cumulative incidence of relapses (0.21±0.04 vs. 0.10±0.01; P=0.001).
Although IKZF1 deletions were significantly associated with the P2RY8-CRLF2
rearrangement, their prognostic value was found to be independent from this
association. Thus, IKZF1 deletion is an independent predictor of treatment
outcome and a strong candidate marker for integration in future treatment
stratification strategies on ALL-BFM protocols. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:

The transcription factor Ikaros was originally found to function as a key
regulator of lymphocyte differentiation. In this study, we provide the first
evidence that Ikaros is expressed at higher levels in ovarian cancer tissues
compared with normal ovarian tissues and is significantly associated with high
FIGO stage and low differentiation state in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. To
this end, we transfected IK1 (full length of Ikaros) into the SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cell line and examined cell biological behaviors including proliferation, 
migration and invasion. We found that overexpression of IK1 inhibited cell
proliferation by inducing G1 arrest, accompanied by the upregulation of P27 and
P21 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and D2. On the other hand, IK1 increased the 
migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, as assessed by scratch-wound
assay, transwell migration assay, and invasion assay. Overexpression of IK1
significantly increased Slug but not Snail1 expression at both mRNA and protein
levels. It also downregulated and upregulated E-cadherin and MMP-2, two target
genes of Slug involved in migration, respectively. Furthermore, knocking down
Slug abrogated IK1-mediated increase in migration and invasion. These data
suggest that Slug plays an important role in IK1-induced migration and invasion. 
In conclusion, we show for the first time that IK1 plays a dual role in the
proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, providing new
insights into their metastasis.

PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of significant acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -related genes: CRLF2 deregulation (CRLF2-d), IGH@
translocations (IGH@-t), and deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1,
and EBF1 in adolescents and adults.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 454 patients (age 15 to 60 years old) 
treated on the multicenter United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Trial
XII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2993 trial (UKALLXII/ECOG2993) with
Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor ALL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used to detect these
genetic alterations.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (5%) had CRLF2-d (P2RY8-CRLF2, n = 7; IGH@-CRLF2, n =
13), and 36 patients (8%) harbored an IGH@-t with a different partner gene. There
was little overlap between IGH@-t, CRLF2-d, and established chromosomal
abnormalities. Deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, or EBF1 were 
prevalent with 101 (33%) of 304 patients harboring one and 102 (33%) harboring
two or more alterations, occurring with varying frequency in all cytogenetic
subgroups. The 5-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), and
overall survival (OS) rates for the whole cohort were 40%, 55%, and 43%,
respectively. Patients with CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions were associated 
with an inferior outcome in univariate but not multivariate analysis. In
particular, CRLF2-d patients had a lower RFS compared with other patients (30%), 
whereas those with IGH@-t or IKZF1 deletions had a lower OS (27% and 35%,
respectively).
CONCLUSION: CRLF2-d and IGH@-t represent distinct subtypes of adolescent and
adult ALL. Deletions of key B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes
are highly prevalent but vary in frequency by cytogenetic subgroup. CRLF2-d,
IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions are associated with poor outcome in adolescent and
adult ALL.

BACKGROUND: Deletions of IKAROS (IKZF1) frequently occur in B-cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) but the mechanisms by which they influence
pathogenesis are unclear. To address this issue, a cohort of 144 adult B-ALL
patients (106 BCR-ABL1-positive and 38 B-ALL negative for known molecular
rearrangements) was screened for IKZF1 deletions by single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) arrays; a sub-cohort of these patients (44%) was then analyzed
for gene expression profiling.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total or partial deletions of IKZF1 were more frequent in
BCR-ABL1-positive than in BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL cases (75% vs 58%,
respectively, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.04). Comparison of the gene expression signatures of patients
carrying IKZF1 deletion vs those without showed a unique signature featured by
down-regulation of B-cell lineage and DNA repair genes and up-regulation of genes
involved in cell cycle, JAK-STAT signalling and stem cell self-renewal. Through
chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays we corroborated
these findings both in vivo and in vitro, showing that Ikaros deleted isoforms
lacked the ability to directly regulate a large group of the genes in the
signature, such as IGLL1, BLK, EBF1, MSH2, BUB3, ETV6, YES1, CDKN1A (p21), CDKN2C
(p18) and MCL1.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we identified and validated for the first time molecular
pathways specifically controlled by IKZF1, shedding light into IKZF1 role in
B-ALL pathogenesis.

Ikaros family zinc finger 1, encoded by IKZF1, are lymphoid-restricted zinc
finger transcription factors that share common N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc
finger DNA-binding domain. IKZF1 play multiple important roles on regulators of
lymphocyte differentiation and hematological tumor suppressor. Our genome-wide
association (GWA) studies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) independently
identified genetic variants in IKZF1 associated with SLE, which are supported by 
other studies. Previous studies found that lower expression of IKZF1 may play
critical roles in activating some signal pathways involved in SLE, such as signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)4 and interferon pathways. In
addition, IKZF1 has been implicated in roles involved in some hematologic traits 
or abnormalities, such as erythrocyte measures, myelofibrosis, and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which may be common clinical manifestations or
co-occurrence hematological diseases of patients with SLE. All these findings
suggest that IKZF1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE. In this
article, we discuss the existing understanding of the role of IKZF1 on the
physiological and pathological functions associated with SLE, providing insights 
that may assist in the development of new therapeutic strategies based on IKZF1
for patients with SLE.

Identification of a HMGA2-EFCAB6 gene rearrangement following next-generation

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) result from genetically altered hematopoietic
stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage differentiation. The study
of genomic mutations identified so far suggests that they occur after a common
ancestral event or that different mutations result in similar MPN phenotypes. We 
report analysis of a chromosomal translocation, t(12;22)(q14.3;q13.2), in a
patient with a BCR-ABL1-negative, JAK2V617F-positive MPN. Comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) array and targeted sequencing detected no mutation in nine
genes reported to influence the JAK2V617F-driven MPNs (MPL, LNK, CBL, TET2, EZH2,
IKZF1, IDH1, IDH2, ASXL1). Next-generation sequencing revealed a balanced
HMGA2-EFCAB6 genomic rearrangement. The HMGA2 breakpoint leads to the loss of
seven 3'UTR binding sites for the microRNA (miRNA) let-7 tumor suppressor. The
breakpoint in the EFCAB6 gene abrogates transcription of EFCAB6. Measurement of
expression showed retention of HMGA2 transcription and no detectable EFCAB6
transcript. Allele burden comparison in a sample containing the translocation,
showed 90% HMGA2-EFCAB6 versus 50% JAK2V617F allele dose, suggesting HMGA2-EFCAB6
rearrangement plays a more ancestral role, pre-JAK2V617F, in the neoplastic
process. The pathogenicity of the translocation may rest on collaborations among 
JAK2V617F-induced constitutive activation of JAK2, the oncogenic property of
HMGA2, and disrupted pathways, such as alteration in DJ-1 expression, resulting
from the impact of EFCAB6 abrogation.

Epigenetic abnormalities in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a target for novel
therapeutic strategies.

Mascarenhas J, Roper N, Chaurasia P, Hoffman R.

The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of clonal hematological
malignancies characterized by a hypercellular bone marrow and a tendency to
develop thrombotic complications and to evolve to myelofibrosis and acute
leukemia. Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemia, where a single disease-initiating 
genetic event has been identified, a more complicated series of genetic mutations
appear to be responsible for the BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs which include
polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. Recent
studies have revealed a number of epigenetic alterations that also likely
contribute to disease pathogenesis and determine clinical outcome. Increasing
evidence indicates that alterations in DNA methylation, histone modification, and
microRNA expression patterns can collectively influence gene expression and
potentially contribute to MPN pathogenesis. Examples include mutations in genes
encoding proteins that modify chromatin structure (EZH2, ASXL1, IDH1/2,
JAK2V617F, and IKZF1) as well as epigenetic modification of genes critical for
cell proliferation and survival (suppressors of cytokine signaling, polycythemia 
rubra vera-1, CXC chemokine receptor 4, and histone deacetylase (HDAC)). These
epigenetic lesions serve as novel targets for experimental therapeutic
interventions. Clinical trials are currently underway evaluating HDAC inhibitors 
and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors for the treatment of patients with MPNs.

Despite risk-adapted treatment, survival of children with relapse of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor compared with that of patients with
initial diagnosis of ALL. Leukemia-associated genetic alterations may provide
novel prognostic factors to refine present relapse treatment strategies.
Therefore, we investigated the clinical relevance of 13 recurrent genetic
alterations in 204 children treated uniformly for relapsed B-cell precursor ALL
according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. The most common alterations were
deletions of CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, fusion of ETV6-RUNX1 and deletions
and/or mutations of TP53. Multivariate analysis identified IKZF1 deletion and
TP53 alteration as independent predictors of inferior outcome (P=0.002 and
P=0.001). Next, we investigated how both alterations can improve the established 
risk stratification in relapsed ALL. Intermediate-risk relapse patients with low 
minimal residual disease are currently considered to have a good prognosis. In
this group, deletion of IKZF1 and alteration of TP53 identify patients with
significantly inferior outcome (P<0.001). In high-risk relapse patients, deletion
of IKZF1 is strongly predictive of a second relapse after stem cell
transplantation (P<0.001). We conclude that IKZF1 and TP53 represent relevant
prognostic factors that should be considered in future risk assessment of
children with relapsed ALL to indicate treatment intensification or intervention.

Among 4,780 consecutive adult acute lymphoblastic/myeloblastic leukemia patients,
we identified 117 (2.4%) patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia fulfilling 
WHO 2008 criteria; these were classified as: Blymphoid+ myeloid (n=64),
T-lymphoid+myeloid (n=38), B+T-lymphoid (n=14) and trilineage (n=1). Of 92
patients karyotyped, 59 were abnormal and were classified as: complex (22 of 92),
t(9;22)(q34;q11) (14 of 92), monosomy 7 (7 of 92), polysomy 21 (7 of 92),
t(v;11q23) (4 of 92), t(10;11)(p15;q21) (3 of 92), while STIL-TAL1 fusion was
detected in one (T+My) patient. After investigating common acute leukemia-related
mutations in 17 genes, 12 of 31 (39%) patients were found to have at least one
mutation, classified with: IKZF1 deletion (4 of 31), and EZH2 (3 of 31), ASXL1 (3
of 31), ETV6 (2 of 31), NOTCH1 (1 of 31), and TET2 (1 of 31) mutations. Array-CGH
revealed genomic deletions of CDKN2A (4 of 12), IKZF1 (3 of 12), MEF2C (2 of 12),
BTG1 (2 of 12), together with BCOR, EBF1, K-RAS, LEF1, MBNL1, PBX3, and RUNX1
(one of 12 each). Our results indicate that mixed-phenotype acute leukemia is a
complex entity with heterogeneous clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and
molecular genetic features.

IRF-5 is a transcription factor activated by toll like receptor (TLR)7 and TLR9
during innate immune responses. IRF-5 activates not only Type I IFN, but also
inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, a genetic variation in the IRF-5 gene
shows a strong association with autoimmune diseases such as Lupus. Here, we
report that IRF5-deficient mice have attenuated IgG2a/c responses to
T-cell-dependent and -independent antigens and to polyoma virus infection. This
defect is due to the intrinsic deletion of IRF-5 in B cells, as SCID mice
reconstituted with Irf5-/- B cells show a decrease in IgG2a/c expression after
viral infection compared with mice that received wild-type B cells. Irf5-/-B
cells in vitro have diminished TLR and cytokine-induced class switching to
IgG2a/c. Addressing the molecular mechanism, we show that IRF-5 regulates IgG2a/c
expression by decreasing Ikaros expression; reconstitution of IRF-5 in Irf5-/- B 
cells downregulates Ikaros levels and increases switching to IgG2a/c. The IRF
site in ikzf1 promoter binds IRF-5, IRF-4 and IRF-8. We show that IRF-8 but not
IRF-4 activates the ikzf1 promoter, and IRF-5 inhibits the transcriptional
activity of IRF-8. Collectively, these results identify the IRF-5-Ikaros axis as 
a critical modulator of IgG2a/c class switching.

Children with Down's syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of developing acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and have a low frequency of established genetic
aberrations. We aimed to determine which genetic abnormalities are involved in DS
ALL. We studied the frequency and prognostic value of deletions in B-cell
development genes and aberrations of janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and cytokine
receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) using array-comparative genomic hybridization, and
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in a population-based cohort of 
34 Dutch Childhood Oncology Group DS ALL samples. A population-based cohort of 88
DS samples from the UK trials was used to validate survival estimates for IKZF1
and CRLF2 abnormalities. In total, 50% of DS ALL patients had =1 deletion in the 
B-cell development genes: PAX5 (12%), VPREB1 (18%) and IKZF1 (35%). JAK2 was
mutated in 15% of patients, genomic CRLF2 rearrangements in 62%. Outcome was
significantly worse in patients with IKZF1 deletions (6-year event-free survival 
(EFS) 45 ± 16% vs 95 ± 4%; P=0.002), which was confirmed in the validation cohort
(6-year EFS 21 ± 12% vs 58 ± 11%; P=0.002). This IKZF1 deletion was a strong
independent predictor for outcome (hazard ratio EFS 3.05; P=0.001). Neither CRLF2
nor JAK2 were predictors for worse prognosis. If confirmed in prospective series,
IKZF1 deletions may be used for risk-group stratification in DS ALL.

BACKGROUND: The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is commonly rearranged in
infant leukemia (IL). Genetic determinants of susceptibility to IL are unknown.
Recent genome-wide association studies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) have identified susceptibility loci at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE.
PROCEDURE: We genotyped these loci in 171 infants with leukemia and 384 controls 
and evaluated associations overall, by subtype [ALL, acute myeloid leukemia
(AML)], and by presence (+) or absence (-) of MLL rearrangements.
RESULTS: Homozygosity for a variant IKZF1 allele (rs11978267) increased risk of
infant AML [Odds ratio (OR)<U+2009>= 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI)<U+2009>= 1.8-8.4]; the
increased risk was similar for AML/MLL+ and MLL- cases. In contrast, risk of
ALL/MLL- was increased in infants homozygous for the IKZF1 variant (OR = 5.1, 95%
CI = 1.8-14.5) but the variant did not modify risk of ALL/MLL+. For ARID5B
(rs10821936), homozygosity for the variant allele increased risk for the ALL/MLL-
subgroup only (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 2.5-20.6). There was little evidence of an
association with the CEBP variant (rs2239633).
CONCLUSION: IKZF1 is expressed in early hematopoiesis, including precursor
myeloid cells. Our data provide the first evidence that IKZF1 modifies
susceptibility to infant AML, irrespective of MLL rearrangements, and could
provide important new etiologic insights into this rare and heterogeneous
hematopoietic malignancy.

Identification of c-Myb Target Genes in K562 Cells Reveals a Role for c-Myb as a 
Master Regulator.

The c-Myb transcription factor is an important regulator of hematopoietic cell
development. c-Myb is expressed in immature hematopoietic cells and plays a
direct role in lineage fate selection, cell cycle progression, and
differentiation of myeloid as well as B- and T-lymphoid progenitor cells. As a
DNA-binding transcription factor, c-Myb regulates specific gene programs through 
activation of target genes. Still, our understanding of these programs is
incomplete. Here, we report a set of novel c-Myb target genes, identified using a
combined approach: specific c-Myb knockdown by 2 different siRNAs and subsequent 
global expression profiling, combined with the confirmation of direct binding of 
c-Myb to the target promoters by ChIP assays. The combination of these 2
approaches, as well as additional validation such as cloning and testing the
promoters in reporter assays, confirmed that MYADM, LMO2, GATA2, STAT5A, and
IKZF1 are target genes of c-Myb. Additional studies, using chromosome
conformation capture, demonstrated that c-Myb target genes may directly interact 
with each other, indicating that these genes may be coordinately regulated. Of
the 5 novel target genes identified, 3 are transcription factors, and one is a
transcriptional co-regulator, supporting a role of c-Myb as a master regulator
controlling the expression of other transcriptional regulators in the
hematopoietic system.

Enhanced Notch activation is advantageous but not essential for T cell
lymphomagenesis in Id1 transgenic mice.

Author information:

Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.

T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is known to be associated with chromosomal 
abnormalities that lead to aberrant expression of a number of transcription
factors such as TAL1, which dimerizes with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E
proteins and inhibits their function. Activated Notch receptors also efficiently 
induce T cell leukemogenesis in mouse models. Interestingly, gain-of-function
mutations or cryptic transcription initiation of the Notch1 gene have been
frequently found in both human and mouse T-ALL. However, the correlations between
these alterations and overall Notch activities or leukemogenesis have not been
thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, we made use of our collection of T cell
lymphomas developed in transgenic mice expressing Id1, which like TAL1, inhibits 
E protein function. By comparing expression levels of Notch target genes in
Id1-expressing tumors to those in tumors induced by a constitutively active form 
of Notch1, N1C, we were able to assess the overall activities of Notch pathways
and conclude that the majority of Id1-expressing tumors had elevated Notch
function to a varying degree. However, 26% of the Id1-expressing tumors had no
evidence of enhanced Notch activation, but that did not delay the onset of
tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we examined the genetic or epigenetic alterations
thought to contribute to ligand-independent activation or protein stabilization
of Notch1 and found that some of the Id1-expressing tumors acquired these
changes, but they are not uniformly associated with elevated Notch activities in 
Id1 tumor samples. In contrast, N1C-expressing tumors do not harbor any PEST
domain mutations nor exhibit intragenic transcription initiation. Taken together,
it appears that Notch activation provides Id1-expressing tumor cells with
selective advantages in growth and survival. However, this may not be absolutely 
essential for lymphomagenesis in Id1 transgenic mice and additional factors could
also cooperate with Id1 to induce T cell lymphoma. Therefore, a broad approach is
necessary in designing T-ALL therapy.

It has been generally acknowledged that the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis
evaluation of leukemia largely rely on an adequate identification of genetic
abnormalities. A systemic analysis of genetic aberrations was performed in a
cohort of 1346 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
in China. The pediatric patients had higher incidence of hyperdiploidy and
t(12;21) (p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 than adults (P<0.0001); in contrast, the occurrence
of Ph and Ik6 variant of IKZF1 gene was much more frequent in adult patients (all
P<0.0001). In B-ALL, the existence of Ik6 and that of BCR-ABL were statistically 
correlated (P<0.0001). In comparison with Western cohorts, the incidence of
t(9;22) (q34;q11)/BCR-ABL (14.60%) in B-ALL and HOX11 expression in T-ALL
(25.24%) seemed to be much higher in our group, while the incidence of t(12;21)
(p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 (15.34%) seemed to be lower in Chinese pediatric patients.
The occurrence of hyperdiploidy was much lower either in pediatric (10.61% vs
20-38%) or adult patients (2.36% vs 6.77-12%) in our study than in Western
reports. In addition, the frequencies of HOX11L2 in adult patients were much
higher in our cohort than in Western countries (20.69% vs 4-11%). In general, it 
seems that Chinese ALL patients bear more adverse prognostic factors than their
Western counterparts do.

As controversy exists regarding the prognostic significance of genomic
rearrangements of CRLF2 in pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) classified as standard/intermediate-risk (SR) or high-risk (HR), we
assessed the prognostic significance of CRLF2 mRNA expression, CRLF2 genomic
lesions (IGH@-CRLF2, P2RY8-CRLF2, CRLF2 F232C), deletion/mutation in genes
frequently associated with high CRLF2 expression (IKZF1, JAK, IL7R), and minimal 
residual disease (MRD) in 1061 pediatric ALL patients (499 HR and 562 SR) on COG 
Trials P9905/P9906. Whereas very high CRLF2 expression was found in 17.5% of
cases, only 51.4% of high CRLF2 expressors had CRLF2 genomic lesions. The
mechanism underlying elevated CRLF2 expression in cases lacking known genomic
lesions remains to be determined. All CRLF2 genomic lesions and virtually all JAK
mutations were found in high CRLF2 expressors, whereas IKZF1 deletions/mutations 
were distributed across the full cohort. In multivariate analyses, NCI risk
group, MRD, high CRLF2 expression, and IKZF1 lesions were associated with
relapse-free survival. Within HR ALL, only MRD and CRLF2 expression predicted a
poorer relapse-free survival; no difference was seen between cases with or
without CRLF2 genomic lesions. Thus, high CRLF2 expression is associated with a
very poor outcome in high-risk, but not standard-risk, ALL. This study is
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00005596 and NCT00005603.

Illegitimate V(D)J recombination involving nonantigen receptor loci in lymphoid
malignancy.

Onozawa M(1), Aplan PD.

National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

V(D)J recombination of antigen receptor loci (IGH, IGK, IGL, TCRA, TCRB, TCRG,
and TCRD) is an essential mechanism that confers enormous diversity to the
mammalian immune system. However, there are now at least six examples of
intrachromosomal interstitial deletions caused by aberrant V(D)J recombination
between nonantigen receptor loci; five of out these six are associated with
lymphoid malignancy. The SIL-SCL fusion and deletions of CDKN2A, IKZF1, Notch1,
and Bcl11b are all associated with lymphoid malignancy. These interstitial
deletions seem to be species specific, as the deletions seen in mice are not seen
in humans; the converse is true as well. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these
rearrangements reveals the hallmarks of V(D)J recombination, including site
specificity near cryptic heptamer signal sequences, exonucleolytic "nibbling" at 
the junction site, and nontemplated "N"-region nucleotide insertion at the
junction site. Two of these interstitial deletions (murine Notch1 and Bcl11b
deletions) have been detected, at low frequency, in tissues from healthy mice
with no evidence of malignancy, similar to the finding of chromosomal
translocations in the peripheral blood or tonsils of healthy individuals. The
contention that these are mediated via V(D)J recombination is strengthened by in 
vivo assays using extrachromosomal substrates, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis which shows Rag2 binding at the sites of
rearrangement. Although the efficiency of these "illegitimate" recombination
events is several orders of magnitude less than that at bona fide antigen
receptor loci, the consequence of such deletions, namely activation of
proto-oncogenes or deletion of tumor suppressor genes, is devastating, and a
major cause for lymphoid malignancy.

Dominant-negative (DN) Ikaros isoforms, having important roles in pathogenesis of
leukemia, are mainly studied in pediatric patients, but little is known about
Chinese adult patients. We examined 339 Chinese adult patients with leukemia and 
demonstrated the different findings between our results and those in several
previous studies showing that DN isoforms overexpressed in Philadelphia
chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+)ALL) and lymphoid/mixed
blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. We confirmed that deletion of IKZF1
gene exons 4-7 is responsible for the generation of Ikaros 6 (Ik6). Moreover, we 
observed that expression of DN isoforms was dynamically consistent with BCR-ABL1 
transcript levels, associated with higher incidence of relapse within 3 months or
poor response to induction chemotherapy in Ph(+)ALL, correlated with high white
blood cell, blast cells, CD34 positive cells, and delayed achieving complete
hematological remission in ALL patients. In conclusion, this study provides a
rationale for the integration of aberrant Ikaros isoforms, notably Ik6 and Ik10, 
in the evaluation of adult ALL, particularly in Ph(+)ALL patients.

C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) is a transcriptional corepressor that plays an 
important role in mammalian development and tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that
CtBP is expressed in adenohypophyseal cells and is expressed at high levels in
human corticotroph, somatotroph, and lactotroph pituitary adenomas. CtBP
interacts with Ikaros isoforms in GH4 and AtT20 pituitary tumor cells. Ikaros and
CtBP1 expression is coordinately induced by hypoxia, and this response is
abrogated by CtBP1 deficiency. Forced reduction of CtBP1 leads to reduced cell
growth, up-regulation of Sprouty 2, and down-regulation of ectonucleotide
pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 2 (Enpp2). Consistent with diminished Enpp2
activity, CtBP1-deficient pituitary cells are more susceptible to hypoxia-induced
apoptosis, which is rescued by Enpp2-derived lysophosphatidic acid treatment.
These results identify putative oncogenic properties of CtBP1 and provide new
insights into the overlapping functions of two members of the chromatin
remodeling network in the response to hypoxic pituitary tumor cell drive.

The molecular characterization of cytogenetic abnormalities has not only provided
insights into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis but also led to the establishment 
of new treatment strategies targeting these abnormalities and thereby further
improve the prognosis of patients. We analyzed the prognosis of 1091 Chinese
patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and explored the
prognostic impacts of a large number of cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities. It
was demonstrated that, in both B- and T-ALL settings, the prognosis was
negatively correlated to the age as reported to date. For childhood T-ALL
patients, it was also documented that the HOX11 expression represented a
favorable prognostic factor as it was in adult ones. We identified CRLF2
overexpression as an intermediate-risk marker and Ik6 variant of IKZF1 gene as a 
high-risk one when stratifying pediatric B-ALL cases according to
cytogenetic/molecular risks. We also found that Ik6 variant and CRLF2
overexpression had an important role in dictating the prognosis of Ph-negative
patients, which may be useful markers in guiding the treatment of ALL in the
future, with tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the other hand reversing the fate of
Ph-positive ALL patients.

Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP ALL) is an aggressive
malignancy of unknown genetic basis. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12
ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in
94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by
activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling
(67% of cases; NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, IL7R, JAK3, JAK1, SH2B3 and BRAF), inactivating 
lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; GATA3, ETV6, RUNX1, IKZF1 and
EP300) and histone-modifying genes (48%; EZH2, EED, SUZ12, SETD2 and EP300). We
also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including DNM2, ECT2L and RELN.
The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global
transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid
leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells. These findings suggest that addition of
myeloid-directed therapies might improve the poor outcome of ETP ALL.

Ikaros represses and activates PU.1 cell-type-specifically through the
multifunctional Sfpi1 URE and a myeloid specific enhancer.

Generation of myeloid and lymphoid cells from progenitors involves dynamic
changes in transcription factor expression and use, and disruption of
hematopoietic transcription factor function and expression can contribute to
leukemic transformation. PU.1 and Ikaros are pivotal factors whose expression and
utilization are dynamically altered during hematopoietic development. Here, we
demonstrate that expression of PU.1, encoded by the Sfpi1 gene, is divergently
regulated by Ikaros in distinct cell type-specific contexts. Chromatin immune
precipitation analysis and functional perturbations revealed that Ikaros can
directly repress or activate Sfpi1 transcription via different PU.1 cis-elements,
with PU.1 and Ikaros collaborating at myeloid-specific elements but not at other 
elements. Our results thus shed light on how PU.1 and Ikaros can act as lineage
competency factors to facilitate both myeloid and lymphoid developmental
programs.

Recent genomic analyses of childhood and adult B-precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) samples have identified novel genetic alterations in essential
lymphoid development and signal transduction pathways, providing insight into the
pathogenesis of high-risk ALL associated with treatment failure. Particular
advances have been made in unraveling the genetics of ALL associated with
overexpression of the cytokine receptor-like factor 2 gene (CRLF2), which is
frequently accompanied by simultaneous activating mutations in genes encoding
Ikaros (IKZF1), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and/or the IL-7 
receptor alpha chain (IL7RA). Children and adults with high-risk
CRLF2-overexpressing ALL have high rates of relapse and dismal overall survival. 
Various groups have thus attempted to characterize the biochemical consequences
of these genetic lesions via preclinical models with the goal of identifying
targets for new therapies. These studies provide early data suggesting the
promise of signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) of the JAK/STAT and PI3K
pathways for CRLF2-overexpressing ALL. Additional research efforts continue to
elucidate these aberrant signaling networks to provide rationale for bringing
STIs into the clinic for these high-risk patients. This review highlights the
current knowledge of the incidence, prognostic significance, and biology of
CRLF2-overexpressing ALL and future directions for development of targeted
therapies.

Ikaros and tumor suppression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Payne KJ(1), Dovat S.

Author information: 
(1)Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, USA.

The Ikzf1 gene encodes Ikaros-a DNA-binding zinc finger protein. Ikaros functions
as a regulator of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. The biological roles 
of Ikaros include regulating the development and function of the immune system
and acting as a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. Genomic
profiling studies identified Ikzf1 as an important tumor suppressor in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly in ALL that is associated with poor
prognosis. This review summarizes currently available data regarding the
structure and function of Ikaros, the clinical relevance of genetic inactivation 
of Ikzf1, and signal transduction pathways that regulate Ikaros function.

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is comprised of multiple subtypes
defined by recurring chromosomal alterations that are important events in
leukemogenesis and are widely used in diagnosis and risk stratification, yet fail
to fully explain the biology of this disease. In the last 5 years, genome-wide
profiling of gene expression, structural DNA alterations and sequence variations 
has yielded important insights into the nature of submicroscopic genetic
alterations that define novel subgroups of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
cooperate with known cytogenetic alterations in leukemogenesis. Importantly,
several of these alterations are important determinants of risk of relapse and
are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, these advances and
future directions in the genomic analysis of ALL are discussed.

In recent years, the panel of known molecular mutations in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) has been continuously increased. In Philadelphia-positive ALL,
deletions of the IKZF1 gene were identified as prognostically adverse factors.
These improved insights in the molecular background and the clinical
heterogeneity of distinct cytogenetic subgroups may allow most differentiated
therapeutic decisions, for example, with respect to the indication to allogeneic 
HSCT within genetically defined ALL subtypes. Quantitative real-time PCR allows
highly sensitive monitoring of the minimal residual disease (MRD) load, either
based on reciprocal gene fusions or immune gene rearrangements. Molecular
diagnostics provided the basis for targeted therapy concepts, for example,
combining the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib with chemotherapy in patients
with Philadelphia-positive ALL. Screening for BCR-ABL1 mutations in
Philadelphia-positive ALL allows to identify patients who may benefit from
second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors or from novel compounds targeting
the T315I mutation. Considering the central role of the molecular techniques for 
the management of patients with ALL, efforts should be made to facilitate and
harmonize immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular mutation screening.
Furthermore, the potential of high-throughput sequencing should be evaluated for 
diagnosis and follow-up of patients with B-lineage ALL.

Cell cycle-specific function of Ikaros in human leukemia.

Li Z(1), Song C, Ouyang H, Lai L, Payne KJ, Dovat S.

Author information: 
(1)Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.

BACKGROUND: The loss of Ikaros is associated with the development of B and T cell
leukemia. Data on Ikaros function, including its role as a tumor suppressor and a
regulator of cell cycle progression, come almost exclusively from murine studies;
little is known of the mechanisms that regulate human Ikaros function. Our
studies are the first to examine the function and regulation of human Ikaros
isoforms during the cell cycle in human ALL.
PROCEDURES: Electromobility shift assay (EMSA), confocal microscopy, and
phosphopeptide mapping were used to study Ikaros function during different stages
of the cell cycle.
RESULTS: The DNA-binding activity of human Ikaros complexes undergoes dynamic
changes as the cell cycle progresses. In S phase, Ikaros DNA-binding affinity for
regulatory regions of its target genes decreases, while its binding to
pericentromeric heterochromatin is preserved and correlates with Ikaros
pericentromeric localization. These S phase-specific changes in Ikaros function
are controlled by phosphorylation via the CK2 kinase pathway. During cell cycle
progression, the subcellular pericentromeric localization of the largest human
Ikaros isoforms is different from that in mouse cells, suggesting unique
functions for human Ikaros.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the function of Ikaros is cell
cycle-specific and controlled by CK2-mediated phosphorylation during S phase of
the cell cycle in human T-cell and B-cell ALL. The differences we observe in
murine and human Ikaros function highlight the importance of using human cells in
studies of ALL. These data identify the CK2 pathway as a target for therapies in 
ALL.

Previous cytogenetic studies of myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemias in
children with Down syndrome (ML-DS and DS-ALL) have revealed significant
differences in abnormality patterns between such cases and acute leukemias in
general. Also, certain molecular genetic aberrations characterize DS-related
leukemias, such as GATA1 mutations in ML-DS and deregulation of the CRLF2 gene in
DS-ALL. Whether microdeletions/microduplications also vary between DS and non-DS 
cases is presently unclear. To address this issue, we performed single nucleotide
polymorphism array analyses of eight pediatric ML-DS and 17 B-cell precursor
DS-ALL. In the ML-DS cases, a total of 29 imbalances (20 gains and nine losses)
and two partial uniparental isodisomies (pUPDs) were detected. None of the 11
small (defined as <10 Mb) imbalances were recurrent, nor were the pUPDs, whereas 
of the 18 large aberrations, three were recurrent-dup(1q), +8 and +21. In
contrast, several frequent changes were identified in the DS-ALL cases, which
harbored 82 imbalances (30 gains and 52 losses) and four pUPDs. Of the 40 large
changes, 28 were gains and 12 losses, with +X, dup(Xq), dup(1q), del(7p),
dup(8q), del(9p), dup(9p), del(12p), dup(17q), and +21 being recurrent. Of the 40
microdeletions identified, several targeted specific genes, with the following
being repeatedly deleted: BTG1 and CDKN2A/B (29% of cases), ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5 and
SERP2 (18%), and BTLA, INPP4B, P2RY8, and RB1 (12%). Loss of the SERP2 and INPP4B
genes, encoding the stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member
2 and the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-II, respectively, has previously
never been implicated in leukemia. Although deletions of the other genes have
been associated with ALL, the high frequency of BTG1 loss is a novel finding.
Such deletions may characterize a clinical subgroup of DS-ALL, comprising mainly 
boys with a high median age. In conclusion, ML-DS and DS-ALL are genetically
distinct, with mainly gains in ML-DS and deletions in DS-ALL. Furthermore, DS-ALL
is characterized by several recurrent gene deletions, with BTG1 loss being
particularly frequent.

The PRDM16 (1p36) gene is rearranged in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with t(1;3)(p36;q21), sharing characteristics with
AML and MDS with MECOM (3q26.2) translocations. We used fluorescence in situ
hybridization to study 39 haematological malignancies with translocations
involving PRDM16 to assess the precise breakpoint on 1p36 and the identity of the
partner locus. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
performed in selected cases in order to confirm the partner locus. PRDM16
expression studies were performed on bone marrow samples of patients, normal
controls and CD34(+) cells using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR. PRDM16 was
rearranged with the RPN1 (3q21) locus in 30 cases and with other loci in nine
cases. The diagnosis was AML or MDS in most cases, except for two cases of
lymphoid proliferation. We identified novel translocation partners of PRDM16,
including the transcription factors ETV6 and IKZF1. Translocations involving
PRDM16 lead to its overexpression irrespective of the consequence of the
rearrangement (fusion gene or promoter swap). Survival data suggest that patients
with AML/MDS and PRDM16 translocations have a poor prognosis despite a simple
karyotype and a median age of 65 years. There seems to be an over-representation 
of late-onset therapy-related myeloid malignancies.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex trait characterised by the
production of a range of auto-antibodies and a diverse set of clinical
phenotypes. Currently, ~8% of the genetic contribution to SLE in Europeans is
known, following publication of several moderate-sized genome-wide (GW)
association studies, which identified loci with a strong effect (OR>1.3). In
order to identify additional genes contributing to SLE susceptibility, we
conducted a replication study in a UK dataset (870 cases, 5,551 controls) of 23
variants that showed moderate-risk for lupus in previous studies. Association
analysis in the UK dataset and subsequent meta-analysis with the published data
identified five SLE susceptibility genes reaching genome-wide levels of
significance (P(comb)<5×10(-8)): NCF2 (P(comb) = 2.87×10(-11)), IKZF1 (P(comb) = 
2.33×10(-9)), IRF8 (P(comb) = 1.24×10(-8)), IFIH1 (P(comb) = 1.63×10(-8)), and
TYK2 (P(comb) = 3.88×10(-8)). Each of the five new loci identified here can be
mapped into interferon signalling pathways, which are known to play a key role in
the pathogenesis of SLE. These results increase the number of established
susceptibility genes for lupus to ~30 and validate the importance of using large 
datasets to confirm associations of loci which moderately increase the risk for
disease.

The timing and developmental sequence of events for BCR-ABL1(+) acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), usually associated with IKAROS (IKZF1) deletions,
are unknown. We assessed the status of BCR-ABL1 and IKZF1 genes in 2 pairs of
monozygotic twins, one pair concordant, the other discordant for Philadelphia
chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL. The twin pair concordant for ALL shared
identical BCR-ABL1 genomic sequence indicative of monoclonal, in utero origin.
One twin had IKZF1 deletion and died after transplantation. The other twin had
hyperdiploidy, no IKZF1 deletion, and is still in remission 8 years after
transplantation. In the twin pair discordant for ALL, neonatal blood spots from
both twins harbored the same clonotypic BCR-ABL1 sequence. Low level BCR-ABL1(+) 
cells were present in the healthy co-twin but lacked the IKZF1 deletion present
in the other twin's leukemic cells. The twin with ALL relapsed and died after
transplantation. The co-twin remains healthy and leukemia free. These data show
that in childhood Ph(+) ALL, BCR-ABL1 gene fusion can be a prenatal and possibly 
initiating genetic event. In the absence of additional, secondary changes, the
leukemic clone remains clinically silent. IKZF1 is a secondary and probable
postnatal mutation in these cases, and as a recurrent but alternative copy number
change is associated with poor prognosis.

The BCR-ABL1 induces chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent studies revealed high ratios of loss of the 
IKZF1 gene which encodes IKAROS in BCR-ABL1+ ALL and lymphoblastic crisis (LBC)
of CML. However, little is known about the cooperativity between the aberrant
IKAROS and BCR-ABL1 in primary human hematopoietic cells. We investigated the
effects of expression of BCR-ABL1 and/or IK6, a natural dominant negative isoform
of IKAROS, on proliferation and differentiation of human CD34+ cord blood cells
with or without human bone marrow-derived stromal cells which support early B
cell differentiation. Cell proliferation was remarkably enhanced by co-expression
of BCR-ABL1 and IK6, with reduced expression of glycophorin A and increased
expression of CD41, especially on stromal cells, compared with expression of
BCR-ABL1 alone that resulted in expansion of erythroid progenitors.
Interestingly, p190BCR-ABL1 showed higher dependency on stromal cells to
stimulate cell growth with IK6, than p210BCR-ABL1. Furthermore, the cooperation
was found to depend on direct cell adhesive interaction of hematopoietic
progenitors with stromal cells. These findings suggest that IK6 and BCR-ABL1
synergistically contribute to leukemogenesis in human bone marrow stromal
microenvironment, and may provide a clue to elucidate the mechanisms of
leukemogenesis of Ph+ ALL and CML-LBC.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive
malignancy derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We analyzed
21 cases with array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Complete or
partial chromosomal losses largely outnumbered the gains, with common deleted
regions involving 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B), 13q13.1-q14.3 (RB1), 12p13.2-p13.1
(CDKN1B), 13q11-q12 (LATS2), and 7p12.2 (IKZF1) regions. CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion
was confirmed by FISH. This scenario argues for disruption of cell cycle at
G(1)/S transition, representing a genetic landmark of BPDCN, and possibly
contributing to its pathogenesis. Statistical analysis of overall survival in our
series highlighted an association of poor outcome with biallelic loss of locus
9p21.3. We suggest that, in the absence of reliable parameters for predicting
prognosis in BPDCN other than age, tumor stage, and/or clinical presentation,
simple methods, such as FISH for CDKN2A/CDKN2B, could help to identify the most

Recent studies have shown that SNPs mapping to 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 9p21 (CDKN2A),
10q21.2 (ARID5B), and 14q11.2 (CEBPE) and carrier status for recessively
inherited Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS) influence childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk. To examine these relationship, we analysed 398
ALL cases and 731 controls from Poland. Statistically significant association
between genotype at 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 10q21.2 (ARID5B) and the NBS associated
locus, 8q21.3 (NBN) and ALL risk was found; odds ratios (ORs), 1.34 (P=0.002),
1.33 (P=0.003), and 1325.21 (P=0.0028), respectively. These data provide further 
insights into the biological basis of ALL highlighting the existence of both
common and rare disease susceptibility variants.

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) specific genomic abnormalities provide
important clinical information. In most routine clinical diagnostic laboratories 
conventional karyotyping, in conjunction with targeted screens using e.g.,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is currently considered as the gold
standard to detect such aberrations. Conventional karyotyping, however, is
limited in its resolution and yield, thus hampering the genetic diagnosis of ALL.
We explored whether microarray-based genomic profiling would be feasible as an
alternative strategy in a routine clinical diagnostic setting. To this end, we
compared conventional karyotypes with microarray-deduced copy number aberration
(CNA) karyotypes in 60 ALL cases. Microarray-based genomic profiling resulted in 
a CNA detection rate of 90%, whereas for conventional karyotyping this was 61%.
In addition, many small (< 5 Mb) genetic lesions were encountered, frequently
harboring clinically relevant ALL-related genes such as CDKN2A/B, ETV6, PAX5, and
IKZF1. From our data we conclude that microarray-based genomic profiling serves
as a robust tool in the genetic diagnosis of ALL, outreaching conventional
karyotyping in CNA detection both in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We
also propose a practical workflow for a comprehensive and objective
interpretation of CNAs obtained through microarray-based genomic profiling,
thereby facilitating its application in a routine clinical diagnostic setting.

T-ALL.

To understand the interactions between Notch1 and Ikaros in the evolution of T
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we traced the evolution of T-ALL in
mice with an inherited Ikaros mutation, Ikzf1(Plstc) which inactivates DNA
binding. DNA-binding Ikaros repressed Notch1 response in transfected cell lines
and in CD4(+)8(+) (DP) thymocytes from young pre-leukemic Ikzf1(Plstc)
heterozygous mice. In DP thymocytes, a 50-1000 fold escalation in mRNA for Notch1
target genes Hes1 and Dtx1 preceded thymic lymphoma or leukemia and was closely
correlated with the first detectable differentiation abnormalities, loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) eliminating wild-type Ikzf1, and multiple missense and
truncating Notch1 mutations. These findings illuminate the early stages of
leukemogenesis by demonstrating progressive exaggeration of Notch1 responsiveness
at the DP thymocyte stage brought about by multiple mutations acting in concert
upon the Notch1 pathway.

leukemia.

Ikaros is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an important role in the 
differentiation and proliferation of lymphocytes. Dominant-negative Ikaros
isoform 6 (Ik6), one of its common subtypes, is overexpressed in leukemia
patients and is associated with unfavorable prognosis in childhood B-cell
progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study was to identify
specific isoforms, especially Ik6, in Chinese pediatric patients with ALL. The
mRNA expression of Ikaros was detected in 88 children with previously untreated
ALL by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Sequencing of the PCR products was performed to identify specific isoforms. The
expression of fusion genes was determined by using multiplex RT-PCR. The
functional isoforms Ik1, Ik2/3, and dominant negative isoforms Ik4, 6, 8, 9, 10
identified by nested RT-PCR were further confirmed by sequence analysis. In the
88 cases, the Ik6 was found to be overexpressed in 8 of 70 cases of B-lineage ALL
and in 1 of 18 cases of T-lineage ALL patients. Among Ik6 B-lineage ALL patients,
3 had expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene and 1 had HOX11 expression. Ik6
overexpression was independent of age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, risk 
group, and expression of the fusion genes currently measured in China except
BCR/ABL (P<0.01). And it was strongly associated with elevated levels of minimal 
residual disease at day 28 (P<0.01). Ik6 can be included as a high-risk factor at
diagnosis. In developing countries with limited resources, it can be economically
detected by nested RT-PCR.

The genetic basis of the peripheral blood cell parameters is not fully
elucidated. Thus, it is essential to research the correlation between blood cell 
counts levels and the genome in laboratory animals and subsequently in humans. In
the present study, we examined 288 F(2) mice from a cross between BALB/cW and
C57BL/6J-Mpl(hlb219)/J. The C57BL/6J-Mpl (hlb219)/J strain is a mouse model of
thrombocytopenia. We found very strong correlations for PLT counts and revealed
some highly significant correlations for RBC counts. On the basis of the obtained
results, we presume that genetic control of erythrocyte parameters is divided
into two pathways: first, the morphological determinants responsible for the red 
blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and 
second, the functional pathway determining the hemoglobin content (HGB). The
locus on Chromosome 4 is the only detected quantitative trait locus (QTL)
influencing the analyzed platelets parameters. We also detected highly
significant correlations for erythrocyte parameters on Chromosome 1 (RBC, MCV,
MCH), Chr 7 (HGB), Chr 9 (MCHC), Chr 11 (RBC), and Chr 17 (MCH). Finally, with
regards to the given correlations, using the Mouse Genome Database resource, we
proposed candidate genes with possible meaning for the level of these parameters:
cytokine receptor genes (e.g., Mpl), transcription factor genes (e.g., Xbp1,
Ikzf1), hemoglobin chain genes (e.g., Hbb-b1, Hbb-ar), and many others localized 
in the confidence intervals of found QTLs.

et Cellulaire, Illkirch 67400, France;

Ikaros is a zinc finger transcriptional regulator encoded by the Ikzf1 gene.
Ikaros displays crucial functions in the hematopoietic system and its loss of
function has been linked to the development of lymphoid leukemia. In particular, 
Ikaros has been found in recent years to be a major tumor suppressor involved in 
human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its role in T-cell leukemia, however, 
has been more controversial. While Ikaros deficiency appears to be very frequent 
in murine T-cell leukemias, loss of Ikaros appears to be rare in human T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We review here the evidence linking Ikaros 
to T-ALL in mouse and human systems.

Despite current risk-directed therapy, approximately 15-20% of pediatric patients
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have relapses. Recent genome-wide
analyses have identified that an alteration of IKZF1 is associated with very poor
outcomes in B-cell progenitor ALL. In this study, we determined the prognostic
significance of IKZF1 deletions in patients with childhood ALL. This study
analyzed 242 pediatric B-cell progenitor ALL patients in Taiwan. We developed a
simple yet sensitive multiplex quantitative PCR coupled with capillary
electrophoresis to accurately determine the allele dose of IKZF1, and high
resolution melting was used for mutation screening for all coding exons of IKZF1.
Twenty-six (10.7%) pediatric B-cell progenitor ALL patients were found to harbor 
these deletions. Most of the deletions were broader deletions that encompassed
exon 3 to exon 6, consistent with previous reports. Genomic sequencing of IKZF1
was carried out in all cases and no point mutations were identified. Patients
with IKZF1 deletions had inferior event-free survival (P < 0.001), and overall
survival (P = 0.0016). The association between IKZF1 deletions and event-free
survival was independent of age, leukocyte count at presentation, and cytogenetic
subtype by multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.003, hazard ratio = 2.45). This study
indicates that detection of IKZF1 deletions upon diagnosis of B-cell progenitor
ALL may help to identify patients at risk of treatment failure. IKZF1 deletions
could be incorporated as a new high-risk prognostic factor in future treatment
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
poor prognosis of IKZF1 deletions in an Asian population.

Transcription factors are common targets of epigenetic inactivation in human
cancer. Promoter hypermethylation and subsequent silencing of transcription
factors can lead to further deregulation of their targets. In this study, we
explored the potential epigenetic deregulation in cancer of Ikaros family genes, 
which code for essential transcription factors in cell differentiation and
exhibit genetic defects in hematologic neoplasias. Unexpectedly, our analysis
revealed that Ikaros undergoes very specific promoter hypermethylation in
colorectal cancer, including in all the cell lines studied and around 64% of
primary colorectal adenocarcinomas, with increasing proportions in advanced
Duke's stages. Ikaros hypermethylation occurred in the context of a novel
long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) region. Reintroduction of Ikaros in
colorectal cancer cells, ChIP-chip analysis, and validation in primary samples
led us to identify a number of direct targets that are possibly related with
colorectal cancer progression. Our results not only provide the first evidence
that LRES can have functional specific effects in cancer but also identify
several deregulated Ikaros targets that may contribute to progression in
colorectal adenocarcinoma.

The importance of individual microRNAs (miRNAs) has been established in specific 
cancers. However, a comprehensive analysis of the contribution of miRNAs to the
pathogenesis of any specific cancer is lacking. Here we show that in T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a small set of miRNAs is responsible for the
cooperative suppression of several tumor suppressor genes. Cross-comparison of
miRNA expression profiles in human T-ALL with the results of an unbiased miRNA
library screen allowed us to identify five miRNAs (miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-26a,
miR-92 and miR-223) that are capable of promoting T-ALL development in a mouse
model and which account for the majority of miRNA expression in human T-ALL.
Moreover, these miRNAs produce overlapping and cooperative effects on tumor
suppressor genes implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, including IKAROS (also 
known as IKZF1), PTEN, BIM, PHF6, NF1 and FBXW7. Thus, a comprehensive and
unbiased analysis of miRNA action in T-ALL reveals a striking pattern of
miRNA-tumor suppressor gene interactions in this cancer.

in the Ikaros gene.

BACKGROUND: Congenital pancytopenia is a rare and often lethal condition. Current
knowledge of lymphoid and hematopoietic development in mice, as well as
understanding regulators of human hematopoiesis, have led to the recent discovery
of genetic causes of bone marrow failure disorders. However, in the absence of
mutations of specific genes or a distinct clinical phenotype, many cases of
aplastic anemia are labeled as idiopathic, while congenital immune deficiencies
are described as combined immune deficiency.
PROCEDURE: We describe the case of a 33-week gestation age male with severe
polyhydramnios, hydrops, and ascites who was noted to be pancytopenic at birth.
Bone marrow examination revealed a hypocellular marrow with absent myelopoiesis. 
An immune workup demonstrated profound B lymphopenia, near absent NK cells, and
normal T cell number. Due to the similarity of the patient's phenotype with the
IKAROS knockout mouse, studies were performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood
to assess a potential pathogenic role of Ikaros.
RESULTS: DNA studies revealed a point mutation in one allele of the IKAROS gene, 
resulting in an amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding zinc finger domain.
Functional studies demonstrated that the observed mutation decreased Ikaros
DNA-binding affinity, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed aberrant Ikaros 
pericentromeric localization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report describes a novel case of congenital pancytopenia
associated with mutation of the IKAROS gene. Furthermore, these data suggest a
critical role of IKAROS in human hematopoiesis and immune development.

Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal
myeloid disorders with increased production of terminally differentiated cells.
The disease course is generally chronic, but some patients show disease
progression (secondary myelofibrosis or accelerated phase) and/or leukemic
transformation. We investigated chromosomal aberrations in 408 MPN samples using 
high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays to identify
disease-associated somatic lesions. Of 408 samples, 37.5% had a wild-type
karyotype and 62.5% harbored at least 1 chromosomal aberration. We identified 25 
recurrent aberrations that were found in 3 or more samples. An increased number
of chromosomal lesions was significantly associated with patient age, as well as 
with disease progression and leukemic transformation, but no association was
observed with MPN subtypes, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutational status, or disease
duration. Aberrations of chromosomes 1q and 9p were positively associated with
disease progression to secondary myelofibrosis or accelerated phase. Changes of
chromosomes 1q, 7q, 5q, 6p, 7p, 19q, 22q, and 3q were positively associated with 
post-MPN acute myeloid leukemia. We mapped commonly affected regions to single
target genes on chromosomes 3p (forkhead box P1 [FOXP1]), 4q (tet oncogene family
member 2 [TET2]), 7p (IKAROS family zinc finger 1 [IKZF1]), 7q (cut-like homeobox
1 [CUX1]), 12p (ets variant 6 [ETV6]), and 21q (runt-related transcription factor
1 [RUNX1]). Our data provide insight into the genetic complexity of MPNs and
implicate new genes involved in disease progression.

Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) defines a distinct
subgroup of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)
that has a dismal outcome when treated with standard therapy. For improved
diagnosis and risk stratification, the initiating genetic events need to be
elucidated. To investigate the genetic basis of BCP-ALL, genomes of 94 iAMP21
patients were interrogated by arrays, FISH, and multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification. Most copy number alterations targeted chromosome 21,
reinforcing the complexity of this chromosome. The common region of amplification
on chromosome 21 was refined to a 5.1-mb region that included RUNX1, miR-802, and
genes mapping to the Down syndrome critical region. Recurrent abnormalities
affecting genes in key pathways were identified: IKZF1 (22%), CDKN2A/B (17%),
PAX5 (8%), ETV6 (19%), and RB1 (37%). Investigation of clonal architecture
provided evidence that these abnormalities, and P2RY8-CRLF2, were secondary to
chromosome 21 rearrangements. Patient outcome was uniformly poor with standard
therapy irrespective of the presence or absence of these changes. This study has 
provided evidence that chromosome 21 instability is the only anomaly among those 
so far investigated that is common to all iAMP21 patients, and therefore the
initiating event is likely to be found among the complex structural
rearrangements of this abnormal chromosome.

The outcome of treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with imatinib mesylate
(IM) is inferior when therapy is commenced in late chronic or accelerated phase
as compared to early chronic phase. This may be attributed to additional genomic 
alterations that accumulate during disease progression. We sought to identify
such lesions in patients showing suboptimal response to IM by performing
array-CGH analysis on 39 sequential samples from 15 CML patients. Seventy-four
cumulative copy number alterations (CNAs) consisting of 35 losses and 39 gains
were identified. Alterations flanking the ABL1 and BCR genes on chromosomes 9 and
22, respectively, were the most common identified lesions with 5 patients losing 
variable portions of 9q34.11 proximal to ABL1. Losses involving 1p36, 5q31,
17q25, Y and gains of 3q21, 8q24, 22q11, Xp11 were among other recurrent lesions 
identified. Aberrations were also observed in individual patients, involving
regions containing known leukemia-associated genes; CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, RB1, TLX1, 
AFF4. CML patients in late stages of their disease, harbor pre-existing and
evolving sub-microscopic CNAs that may influence disease progression and IM
response.

The differential gene expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-related processing
enzymes, transcription factors, and receptors responsible for ACTH secretion
between non-pituitary and pituitary ACTH-secreting tumors remains obscure. This
study was attempted to determine the gene expression profiles of transcription
factors (Tpit, NeuroD1 and IKZF1), proprotein convertase (PC) 1/3 and PC2, and
several key receptors linked to ACTH secretion, including corticotrophin
releasing hormone receptor (CRHR1), vasopressin receptor 1b (V1bR), somatostatin 
receptor (SSTR) subtype-2, -5 and dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R) in non-pituitary
and pituitary ACTH-secreting tumors. Surgical tissue specimens from carcinoid
tumors causing ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS: n=4) and pituitary tumors causing
Cushing's disease (CD: n=13), were subjected to real-time RT-PCR for measurements
of each mRNA levels. POMC and CRHR1 mRNA levels in CD were far greater than those
in EAS, whereas IKZF1, PC2, SSTR-2 and -5 mRNA levels in EAS were significantly
greater than those in CD. NeuroD1, Tpit, PC1/3, V1bR and D2R mRNA levels were
comparable between EAS and CD. In conclusion, differential gene expression
profiles revealed more abundant mRNA expression in EAS than in CD of 1) IKZF1
with its potential implication of cell differentiation and hormone secretion, 2) 
PC2 with its possible enhanced processing activity of mature ACTH, and 3) SSTR-2 
and -5 with their potential therapeutic application of more selective agonists in
EAS patients.

High-risk (HR) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains one of the greatest
challenges in pediatric oncology. Relapsed ALL is a leading cause of death in
young people, and further improvements in outcome will required the development
of therapeutic approaches directed against rational therapeutic targets, as
escalation of the intensity of existing therapies is limited by toxicity. This
review summarizes advances in the biology and treatment of HR and relapsed ALL
presented at a symposium at the 2010 American Society for Pediatric Hematology
and Oncology Annual Meeting. Analysis of large patient cohorts has identified
several factors associated with HR of relapse including older age, T-lineage
disease, and persisting minimal residual disease (MRD) early in therapy. As the
results of salvage therapy remain poor, new treatment approaches are needed.
BCR-ABL1-positive (Ph+) ALL has historically had a very poor outcome, but recent 
studies have demonstrated the impressive improvements in treatment outcome with
the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). High-resolution genomic profiling
of genetic alterations and gene expression has revolutionized our understanding
of the genetic basis of ALL, and has identified several alterations associated
with poor outcome, including mutations of the lymphoid transcription factor gene 
IKZF1 (IKAROS), activating mutations of Janus kinases, and rearrangement of the
lymphoid cytokine receptor gene CRLF2. These data indicated that the genetic
basis of HR-ALL is multifactorial, and have also provided a new potential
therapeutic option directed at JAK inhibition.

Single nucleotide polymorphism-based oligonucleotide arrays have been used as a
research tool to detect genomic copy number changes and allelic imbalance in a
variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The high resolution,
genome-wide coverage, minimal DNA requirements, and relatively short turnaround
time are advantageous for use in a clinical setting. We validated the Illumina
HumanHap550 BeadChip array for clinical use by analyzing 127 pediatric leukemia
and lymphoma samples that had previously been characterized by means of standard 
cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A higher resolution 
Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip array was ultimately used for clinical testing. To 
date, 180 samples from children with a suspected or confirmed hematologic
malignancy have been analyzed. Of the 180 clinical samples, 130 (72%) bone marrow
or lymphoma specimens had aberrations revealed by the array that were not seen in
the karyotypes. These typically included deletions in genes associated with B- or
T-cell malignancies, such as CDKN2A/B, PAX5, and IKZF1. There were also 75
regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (>5 Mb threshold) detected 
in 49 samples in this cohort, which could be categorized as constitutional or
acquired abnormalities. On the basis of our experience in the last 2 years, we
suggest that single nucleotide polymorphism arrays are a valuable addition to,
but not a replacement for, standard cytogenetic approaches for hematologic
malignancies.

Ikaros is degraded by proteasome-dependent mechanism in the early phase of
apoptosis induction.

Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong

Ikaros is an important transcription factor involved in the development and
differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In this work, we found that
chemotherapeutic drugs or ultraviolet radiation (UV) treatment could reduce the
expression of full-length Ikaros (IK1) protein in less than 3h in leukemic NB4,
Kasumi-1 and Jurkat cells, prior to the activation of caspase-3. Etoposide
treatment could not alter the mRNA level of IK1 but it could shorten the
half-life of IK1. Co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or epoxomicin 
but not calpain inhibitor calpeptin inhibited etoposide-induced Ikaros
downregulation. Overexpression of IK1 could accelerate etoposide-induced
apoptosis in NB4 cells, as evidenced by the increase of Annexin V positive cells 
and the more early activation of caspase 3. To our knowledge, this is the first
report to show that upon chemotherapy drugs or UV treatment, IK1 could be
degraded via the proteasome system in the early phase of apoptosis induction.
These data might shed new insight on the role of IK1 in apoptosis and the
post-translational regulation of IK1.

OBJECTIVE: IKZF1 encoding Ikaros, an essential regulator of lymphopoiesis and
immune homeostasis, has been implicated in the development of childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL). Because recent genome-wide association (GWA)
studies have linked a region of the 3'-UTR of IKZF1 with C-ALL susceptibility, we
tested whether IKZF1 is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: rs10272724 (T>C) near IKZF1 at 7p12 was genotyped in
8,333 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 9,947 control subjects, and 3,997
families of European ancestry. Association was tested using logistic regression
in the case-control data and by the transmission disequilibrium test in the
families. Expression data for IKZF1 by rs10272724 genotype were obtained using
quantitative PCR of mRNA/cDNA generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from 88 individuals, whereas expression data for five other neighboring genes
were obtained from the online Genevar dataset.
RESULTS: The minor allele of rs10272724 (C) was found to be protective from type 
1 diabetes (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.83-0.91]; P = 1.1 × 10(-11)). rs10272724
was not correlated with levels of two transcripts of IKZF1 in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The major susceptibility genotype for C-ALL confers protection from 
type 1 diabetes. Our finding strengthens the link between autoimmunity and
lymphoid cancers. Further investigation is warranted for the genetic effect
marked by rs10272724, its impact on IKZF1, and the role of Ikaros and other
family members, Ailios (IKZF3) and Eos (IKZF4), in autoimmunity.

To update oncologists on pathogenesis, contemporary diagnosis, risk
stratification, and treatment strategies in BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative 
neoplasms, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 
primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Recent literature was reviewed and interpreted in
the context of the authors' own experience and expertise. Pathogenetic mechanisms
in PV, ET, and PMF include stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation and
secondary stromal changes in the bone marrow and spleen. Most patients carry an
activating JAK2 or MPL mutation and a smaller subset also harbors LNK, CBL, TET2,
ASXL1, IDH, IKZF1, or EZH2 mutations; the precise pathogenetic contribution of
these mutations is under investigation. JAK2 mutation analysis is now a formal
component of diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF, but its prognostic utility 
is limited. Life expectancy in the majority of patients with PV or ET is
near-normal and disease complications are effectively (and safely) managed by
treatment with low-dose aspirin, phlebotomy, or hydroxyurea. In PMF, survival and
quality of life are significantly worse and current therapy is inadequate. In ET 
and PV, controlled studies are needed to show added value and justify the risk of
unknown long-term health effects associated with nonconventional therapeutic
approaches (eg, interferon-alfa). The unmet need for treatment in PMF dictates a 
different approach for assessing the therapeutic value of new drugs (eg, JAK
inhibitors, pomalidomide) or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

How new advances in genetic analysis are influencing the understanding and
treatment of childhood acute leukemia.

Tennessee, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes the recent advances in genomic profiling
that have provided critical new insights into the biology of acute leukemia in
children.
RECENT FINDINGS: Acute leukemia genomes commonly harbor submicroscopic gains and 
deletions of DNA which target key cellular pathways that influence leukemogenesis
and the likelihood of treatment failure, particularly in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). Notably, genetic alterations targeting transcriptional regulators
of lymphoid development are a hallmark of B-progenitor ALL, and alteration of
specific genes in this pathway, such as IKZF1 (encoding IKAROS), are associated
with high-risk ALL. Integrated genomic profiling has identified potential
therapeutic targets in ALL, including aberrant cytokine receptor signaling
mediated by rearrangements and mutation of CRLF2 and JAK2. Genome-wide
association studies are also providing important insights into the role of
inherited genetic variation and susceptibility to ALL. In contrast, genomic
profiling of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has thus far yielded fewer insights,
but ongoing resequencing of leukemia genomes is uncovering novel mutations in
both ALL and AML.
SUMMARY: Genomic profiling has identified important new genetic lesions that
contribute to leukemogenesis. These findings will have important implications for
the development of new diagnostic tests and treatment approaches in high-risk
leukemia. Future studies will be increasingly reliant on comprehensive genomic
sequencing to reveal the spectrum of genetic alterations in this disease, with
the ultimate aim of improving the treatment outcome for leukemia patients.

B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common childhood
malignancy and remains a leading cause of death in children and young adults.
Current therapeutic approaches involve intensive combination chemotherapy, which 
fails in up to one quarter of patients. New treatment approaches directed against
rational therapeutic targets are required. Recent genomic profiling of ALL has
identified several genetic alterations associated with a high risk of treatment
failure. Deletion or sequence mutation of the lymphoid transcription factor gene 
IKZF1 (IKAROS) is associated with a high rate of leukemic relapse, and testing
for IKZF1 alterations at diagnosis may aid risk stratification. A subset of B-ALL
patients with IKZF1 alterations have a transcriptional profile similar to
BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, and these patients commonly have novel rearrangements and 
mutations resulting in aberrant cytokine receptor signaling and activation of
kinase signaling cascades, including rearrangement of CRLF2 and activating
mutations of Janus kinases (JAK1 and JAK2). JAK inhibitor therapy is under
investigation in children with relapsed and refractory malignancies, including
leukemia.

Deregulation of Aiolos expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated
with epigenetic modifications.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a clonal accumulation of
mature neoplastic B cells that are resistant to apoptosis. Aiolos, a member of
the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcription factors, plays an important role
in the control of mature B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation. In this
study, we showed that Aiolos expression is up-regulated in B-CLL cells. This
overexpression does not implicate isoform imbalance or disturb Aiolos subcellular
localization. The chromatin status at the Aiolos promoter in CLL is defined by
the demethylation of DNA and an enrichment of euchromatin associated histone
markers, such as the dimethylation of the lysine 4 on histone H3. These
epigenetic modifications should allow its upstream effectors, such as nuclear
factor-<U+03BA>B, constitutively activated in CLL, to gain access to promoter, resulting
up-regulation of Aiolos. To determine the consequences of Aiolos deregulation in 
CLL, we analyzed the effects of Aiolos overexpression or down-regulation on
apoptosis. Aiolos is involved in cell survival by regulating the expression of
some Bcl-2 family members. Our results strongly suggest that Aiolos deregulation 
by epigenetic modifications may be a hallmark of CLL.

leukemia.

Response to therapy as determined by minimal residual disease (MRD) is currently 
used for stratification in treatment protocols for pediatric acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL). However, the large MRD-based medium risk group (MRD-M; 50-60% of 
the patients) harbors many relapses. We analyzed MRD in 131 uniformly treated
precursor-B-ALL patients and evaluated whether combined MRD and IKZF1 (Ikaros
zinc finger-1) alteration status can improve risk stratification. We confirmed
the strong prognostic significance of MRD classification, which was independent
of IKZF1 alterations. Notably, 8 of the 11 relapsed cases in the large MRD-M
group (n=81; 62%) harbored an IKZF1 alteration. Integration of both MRD and IKZF1
status resulted in a favorable outcome group (n=104; 5 relapses) and a poor
outcome group (n=27; 19 relapses), and showed a stronger prognostic value than
each of the established risk factors alone (hazard ratio (95%CI): 24.98
(8.29-75.31)). Importantly, whereas MRD and IKZF1 status alone identified only 46
and 54% of the relapses, respectively, their integrated use allowed prediction of
79% of all the relapses with 93% specificity. Because of the unprecedented
sensitivity in upfront relapse prediction, the combined parameters have high
potential for future risk stratification, particularly for patients originally
classified as non-high risk, such as the large group of MRD-M patients.

Variation at 7p12.2 and 10q21.2 influences childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
risk in the Thai population and may contribute to racial differences in leukemia 
incidence.

Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) have identified 7p12.2, 9p21.3, 10q21.2, and 14q11.2 SNPs that
confer modest risks of ALL. These studies have been conducted in European
populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other
populations with a lower incidence of ALL. To explore the impact of these
variants on ALL risk in the Thai population, we genotyped 190 cases of ALL and
182 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), rs7089424 and
rs10821938 (10q21.2), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Consistent with findings in
European populations, rs4132601 genotype was significantly associated with risk
of ALL (odds ratio [OR]<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-2.44;
p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.04), and rs10821938 genotype was significantly associated with B-cell
precursor ALL (OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.97; p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.03). There were, however,
differences in allele frequencies in SNPs observed between Thai and Caucasian
populations (e.g. IKZF1, rs4132601; risk allele frequency [RAF] ratio of 0.36 for
Thai/Caucasian). These differences, combined with differences in linkage
disequilibrium structure between populations or differences in effect size
between populations, may contribute to racial differences in ALL incidence.

Recent genomic studies have shown that copy number abnormalities (CNA) of genes
involved in lymphoid differentiation and cell cycle control are common in B-cell 
precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We have evaluated Multiplex
Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) on 43 BCP-ALL patients for the
detection of the most common deletions among these genes and compared the results
to those obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic
quantitative PCR (qPCR). There was good correlation between methods for CDKN2A/B,
IKZF1, and PAX5 deletions in the majority of cases and MLPA confirmed the
presence of deletions within the PAR1 region in two of three cases identified by 
FISH. Small intragenic aberrations detected by MLPA, which were below the
resolution of FISH for CDKN2A/B (n = 7), IKZF1 (n = 3), and PAX5 (n = 3) were
confirmed by qPCR. MLPA and qPCR were unable to detect populations present at a
low level (<20%) by FISH. In addition, although MLPA identified the presence of a
deletion, it was unable to discern the presence of mixed cell populations which
had been identified by FISH: CDKN2A/B (n = 3), IKZF1 (n = 1), PAX5 (n = 2), and
PAR1 deletion (n = 1). Nevertheless, this study has demonstrated that MLPA is a
robust technique for the reliable detection of CNA involving multiple targets in 
a single test and thus is ideal for rapid high throughput testing of large
cohorts with a view to establishing incidence and prognostic significance.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease comprising multiple
subtypes with different genetic alterations and responses to therapy. Recent
genome-wide profiling studies of ALL have identified a number of novel genetic
alterations that target key cellular pathways in lymphoid growth and
differentiation and are associated with treatment outcome. Notably, genetic
alteration of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 is a hallmark of
multiple subtypes of ALL with poor prognosis, including BCR-ABL1-positive
lymphoid leukemia and a subset of 'BCR-ABL1-like' ALL cases that, in addition to 
IKZF1 alteration, harbor genetic mutations resulting in aberrant lymphoid
cytokine receptor signaling, including activating mutations of Janus kinases and 
rearrangement of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2). Recent insights from
genome-wide profiling studies of B-progenitor ALL and the potential for new
therapeutic approaches in high-risk disease are discussed.

Biomarkers to predict response to therapy in adults with Philadelphia
chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are not yet
established. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of earlier genome-wide
gene expression studies to identify pathway-based genes that are associated with 
therapeutic response. The predictive power of these genes was validated by
transcript profiling in diagnostic bone marrow samples from Ph+ ALL patients
using a quantitative real-time PCR array. Gene expression was correlated with
cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, including presence of ABL1 mutations
and IKZF1 deletion. A total of 43 de novo Ph+ ALL patients treated uniformly with
tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with chemotherapy were selected to validate
46 identified genes. A 9-gene signature was established to distinguish optimal
responders from patients with persistent residual disease and early molecular
recurrence. The signature was subsequently validated with 87% predictive accuracy
in an independent validation set of patients. When initially optimal responders
relapsed, their gene expression patterns also shifted. Optimal responders showed 
upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis pathways, whereas
poor responders had higher expression of genes that facilitate tumor cell
survival in hypoxic conditions as well as development of drug resistance. This
unique 9-gene signature may better enable stratification of patients to proper
therapeutic regimens and provides new insights into mechanisms of Ph+ ALL
response to therapy.

To resolve the genetic heterogeneity within pediatric high-risk B-precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a clinically defined poor-risk group with few known
recurring cytogenetic abnormalities, we performed gene expression profiling in a 
cohort of 207 uniformly treated children with high-risk ALL. Expression profiles 
were correlated with genome-wide DNA copy number abnormalities and clinical and
outcome features. Unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiling data
revealed 8 unique cluster groups within these high-risk ALL patients, 2 of which 
were associated with known chromosomal translocations (t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1) or
MLL), and 6 of which lacked any previously known cytogenetic lesion. One unique
cluster was characterized by high expression of distinct outlier genes AGAP1,
CCNJ, CHST2/7, CLEC12A/B, and PTPRM; ERG DNA deletions; and 4-year relapse-free
survival of 94.7% ± 5.1%, compared with 63.5% ± 3.7% for the cohort (P = .01). A 
second cluster, characterized by high expression of BMPR1B, CRLF2, GPR110, and
MUC4; frequent deletion of EBF1, IKZF1, RAG1-2, and IL3RA-CSF2RA; JAK mutations
and CRLF2 rearrangements (P < .0001); and Hispanic ethnicity (P < .001) had a
very poor 4-year relapse-free survival (21.0% ± 9.5%; P < .001). These studies
reveal striking clinical and genetic heterogeneity in high-risk ALL and point to 
novel genes that may serve as new targets for diagnosis, risk classification, and
therapy.

To ascertain genomic alterations associated with Imatinib resistance in chronic
myeloid leukaemia, we performed high resolution genomic analysis of CD34(+) cells
from 25 Imatinib (IM) resistant and 11 responders CML patients. Using patients'
T-cells as reference, we found significant association between number of acquired

response for patients diagnosed in chronic phase (CP) (p=0.04). Recurrent cryptic
losses were identified on chromosomes 7, 12 and 13. On chromosome 7, recurrent
deletions of the IKZF1 locus were detected, for the first time, in 4 patients in 
CP.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-system autoimmune disease with
complex genetic inheritance. IKZF1 was established as a new susceptibility gene
for SLE in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Chinese Han
population. In order to examine whether expression levels of IKZF1 contribute to 
the pathogenesis of SLE, we estimated IKZF1 mRNA expression levels in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via fluorescent quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 60 patients with SLE and 60
controls. We also explored whether the IKZF1 mRNA expression levels are
associated with the variant of the SNP rs4917014 and the SLE Disease Activity
Index (SLEDAI). The expression levels of IKZF1 mRNA in patients with SLE were
significantly decreased compared with those in healthy controls (P<0.001). No
significant differences were found between IKZF1 mRNA expression levels and
SLEDAI scores, SNP rs4917014. Our results suggest that decreased expression of
IKZF1 mRNA may be correlated with the pathogenesis of SLE.

The remarkable progress in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia (ALL) has been based on the adjustment of therapy to subgroups of
leukaemia stratified by their prognostic implications. Here, the contribution of 
the last decade of advanced genomic research on the clinical management of
childhood ALL is examined. The application of genomics for routine diagnosis of
ALL is feasible but depends on commercial development of appropriate certified
platforms. The discovery of several novel high-risk markers, such as deletions in
IKZF1 might be integrated into clinical protocols in the near future. Several
novel targets for therapy have been identified and have led to phase I/II
therapeutic trials. This and any future progress depends on the maintenance of
high quality bio-banks including biological material and clinical data of each
patient enrolled on a prospective clinical protocol.

DNA methylation signatures define molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma.

Expression profiling has shown 2 main and clinically distinct subtypes of diffuse
large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs): germinal-center B cell-like (GCB) and activated 
B cell-like (ABC) DLBCLs. Further work has shown that these subtypes are
partially characterized by distinct genetic alterations and different survival.
Here, we show with the use of an assay that measures DNA methylation levels of
50,000 CpG motifs distributed among more than 14,000 promoters that these 2 DLBCL
subtypes are also characterized by distinct epigenetic profiles. DNA methylation 
and gene expression profiling were performed on a cohort of 69 patients with
DLBCL. After assigning ABC or GCB labels with a Bayesian expression classifier
trained on an independent dataset, a supervised analysis identified 311
differentially methylated probe sets (263 unique genes) between ABC and GCB
DLBCLs. Integrated analysis of methylation and gene expression showed a core
tumor necrosis factor-a signaling pathway as the principal differentially
perturbed gene network. Sixteen genes overlapped between the core ABC/GCB
methylation and expression signatures and encoded important proteins such as
IKZF1. This reduced gene set was an accurate predictor of ABC and GCB subtypes.
Collectively, the data suggest that epigenetic patterning contributes to the ABC 
and GCB DLBCL phenotypes and could serve as useful biomarker.

Ikaros is a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins. The
Ikaros protein contains two separate regions of zinc-finger domains: 4
DNA-binding zinc fingers near the N-terminus and 2 zinc fingers for
protein-protein interactions near the C-terminus. Here, we identified the Ikaros 
gene from 14 vertebrate genomes and found Ikaros existed in all kinds of
vertebrate including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. Moreover, except rat
and Xenopus tropicalis Ikaros proteins, which lack the first C2H2-type 1 Zinc
finger region, all identified Ikaros proteins contain six C2H2-type 1 Zinc finger
regions. We found human Ikaros gene showed a predominant expression in the liver,
lymph node, thymus, intestine, lung, mammary gland, bone marrow, brain, heart,
placenta and prostate. Moreover, four available SNPs disrupted an existing exonic
splicing enhancer were identified in Ikaros. Besides the reported acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the expression of Ikaros was related to the
prognosis of 13 cases of cancers including blood cancers, breast, lung, ovarian
and skin cancer. Moreover, the relationship between the expression of Ikaros and 
prognosis varied in different cancers, even in the same cancer from different
database. Two tumor-related transcriptional factor (c-Fos and Elk-1) binding
sites were identified within the 1.5-kb regions upstream of the transcriptional
start site of human Ikaros, which may be involved in the effect of Ikaros in
tumors.

Gene expression profiling for diagnosis and therapy in acute leukaemia and other 
haematologic malignancies.

A decade ago, gene expression profiling (GEP) was successfully introduced in
haematological research. Considering the heterogeneity of haematological
malignancies, the growing arsenal of compounds, allowing targeted therapy, e.g.
in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and the
more differentiated indication to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, routine
diagnostic procedures would highly benefit from an introduction of this novel
methodology: by now, the majority of genetically defined leukaemia subtypes has
been accurately reproduced on the basis of distinct gene expression patterns by
various independent research groups. Moreover, classification of
histomorphologically overlapping lymphoma subentities (e.g. Burkitt lymphoma and 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), was considerably improved by GEP. Beyond
that, differential gene expression has provided the basis for assays being able
to predict prognosis of individual patients as well as the response to specific
treatment approaches, e.g. to lenalidomide in MDS. In a high proportion of
Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients,
prognostically adverse deletions of the IKZF1 gene coding for a specific
transcription factor were identified with GEP analysis, which revealed new
insights in the clinical variability of this disorder. Given these advantages of 
GEP, the introduction of this methodology in current diagnostic algorithms of
haematological malignancies should further be validated in clinical studies.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with heterogeneous
clinical manifestations influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Five
novel susceptibility genes (TNIP1, SLC15A4, ETS1, RasGRP3 and IKZF1) for SLE have
been identified in a recent genome-wide association study of a Chinese Han
population. This study investigated their relationships with disease
subphenotypes, including renal nephritis, photosensitivity, antinuclear antibody 
(ANA), age at diagnosis, malar rash, discoid rash, immunological disorder, oral
ulcer, hematological disorder, neurological disorder, serositis, arthritis and
vasculitis. Significant associations were found for the single nucleotide
polymorphism rs10036748 of TNIP1 with photosensitivity (odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, p
= 0.01) and vasculitis (OR = 1.18, p = 0.04); rs10847697 of SLC15A4 with discoid 
rash (OR = 1.18, p = 0.02); rs6590330 of ETS1 with SLE of age at diagnosis <20
years (OR = 1.24, p = 8.91 x 10(-5)); rs13385731 of RasGRP3 with malar rash (OR =
1.20, p = 0.01), discoid rash (OR = 0.78, p = 0.02) and ANA (OR = 0.72, p =
0.004); rs4917014 of IKZF1 with renal nephritis (OR = 1.13, p = 0.02) and malar
rash (OR = 0.83, p = 0.00038), respectively. The study suggested that these
susceptibility genes might not only play important roles in the development of
SLE, but also contribute to the complex phenotypes of SLE.

Transformation to acute leukemia is a major complication of myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPNs), however, the genetic changes leading to transformation remain
largely unknown. We screened nine patients with post-MPN leukemia for chromosomal
aberrations using microarray karyotyping. Deletions on the short arm of
chromosome 7 (del7p) emerged as a recurrent defect. We mapped the common deleted 
region to the IKZF1 gene, which encodes the transcription factor Ikaros. We
further examined the frequency of IKZF1 deletions in a total of 29 post-MPN
leukemia and 526 MPN patients without transformation and observed a strong
association of IKZF1 deletions with post-MPN leukemia in two independent cohorts.
Patients with IKZF1 loss showed complex karyotypes, and del7p was a late event in
the genetic evolution of the MPN clone. IKZF1 deletions were observed in both
undifferentiated and differentiated myeloid cell types, indicating that IKZF1
loss does not cause differentiation arrest but rather renders progenitors
susceptible to transformation, most likely through chromosomal instability.
Induced Ikzf1 haploinsufficiency in primary murine progenitors resulted in
elevated Stat5 phosphorylation and increased cytokine-dependent growth,
suggesting that reduced expression of IKZF1 is sufficient to perturb growth
regulation. Thus, IKZF1 loss is an important step in the leukemic transformation 
of a subpopulation of MPN patients.

Relapse is the most common cause of treatment failure in pediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is often difficult to predict. To explore the
prognostic impact of recurrent DNA copy number abnormalities on relapse, we
performed high-resolution genomic profiling of 34 paired diagnosis and relapse
ALL samples. Recurrent lesions detected at diagnosis, including PAX5, CDKN2A and 
EBF1, were frequently absent at relapse, indicating that they represent secondary
events that may be absent in the relapse-prone therapy-resistant progenitor cell.
In contrast, deletions and nonsense mutations in IKZF1 (IKAROS) were highly
enriched and consistently preserved at the time of relapse. A targeted copy
number screen in an unselected cohort of 131 precursor B-ALL cases, enrolled in
the dexamethasone-based Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocol ALL9,
revealed that IKZF1 deletions are significantly associated with poor relapse-free
and overall survival rates. Separate analysis of ALL9-treatment subgroups
revealed that non-high-risk (NHR) patients with IKZF1 deletions exhibited a
approximately 12-fold higher relative relapse rate than those without IKZF1
deletions. Consequently, IKZF1 deletion status allowed the prospective
identification of 53% of the relapse-prone NHR-classified patients within this
subgroup and, therefore, serves as one of the strongest predictors of relapse at 
the time of diagnosis with high potential for future risk stratification.

Transcription factors from the Ikaros family are involved in lymphocyte
differentiation and have a critical role at specific check points of the
haemopoietic pathway. However, how developmentally regulated changes are
reflected in gene expression programs of lymphocyte differentiation is not well
understood. It has been suggested that disregulation of transcription factors
from the Ikaros family is associated with the development of different human
leukemias. In this work we analyzed the state of Ikaros family members in
different leukemic cells with the aim to explore the transcriptional control of
human hematopoietic lineages and shed some new light on our understanding of
transcription factor significance in human leukemias. By means of RT-PCR and
specific primers we investigated the expression of Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios
transcription factors and their splicing variants in seven leukemia cell lines
derived from different types of leukemia (ALL, CML, AML) and lymphoma
(histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma). In
all of the cell lines examined Ikaros was present in dominant Ik1 to Ik4 isoforms
and small Ik6 isoform was absent. Aiolos was expressed in the majority of the
cell lines, of both, B and T origin, in the form of the full length Aio1. Helios 
was also present only in two long isoforms Hel1 and Hel2, and was absent in one
third of the lines. Similar distribution of positive and negative expression of
Aiolos and Helios found in various types of leukemias could implicate common
pathways of their regulation.

Novel mutations and their functional and clinical relevance in myeloproliferative
neoplasms: JAK2, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH and IKZF1.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) originate from genetically transformed
hematopoietic stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage
differentiation and effective myelopoiesis. Beginning in early 2005, a number of 
novel mutations involving Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Myeloproliferative Leukemia
Virus (MPL), TET oncogene family member 2 (TET2), Additional Sex Combs-Like 1
(ASXL1), Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), Isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH) and IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) have been described
in BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs. However, none of these mutations were MPN specific,
displayed mutual exclusivity or could be traced back to a common ancestral clone.
JAK2 and MPL mutations appear to exert a phenotype-modifying effect and are
distinctly associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and
primary myelofibrosis; the corresponding mutational frequencies are approximately
99, 55 and 65% for JAK2 and 0, 3 and 10% for MPL mutations. The incidence of
TET2, ASXL1, CBL, IDH or IKZF1 mutations in these disorders ranges from 0 to 17%;
these latter mutations are more common in chronic (TET2, ASXL1, CBL) or juvenile 
(CBL) myelomonocytic leukemias, mastocytosis (TET2), myelodysplastic syndromes
(TET2, ASXL1) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia, including blast-phase MPN
(IDH, ASXL1, IKZF1). The functional consequences of MPN-associated mutations
include unregulated JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription) signaling, epigenetic modulation of transcription and abnormal
accumulation of oncoproteins. However, it is not clear as to whether and how
these abnormalities contribute to disease initiation, clonal evolution or blastic
transformation.

GASDERMIN B (GSDMB) belongs to the novel gene family GASDERMIN (GSDM). All GSDM
family members are located in amplicons, genomic regions often amplified during
cancer development. Given that GSDMB is highly expressed in cancerous cells and
the locus resides in an amplicon, GSDMB may be involved in cancer development
and/or progression. However, only limited information is available on GSDMB
expression in tissues, normal and cancerous, from cancer patients. Furthermore,
the molecular mechanisms that regulate GSDMB expression in gastric tissues are
poorly understood. We investigated the spatiotemporal expression patterns of
GSDMB in gastric cancer patients and the 5' regulatory sequences upstream of
GSDMB. GSDMB was not expressed in the majority of normal gastric-tissue samples, 
and the expression level was very low in the few normal samples with GSDMB
expression. Most pre-cancer samples showed moderate GSDMB expression, and most
cancerous samples showed augmented GSDMB expression. Analysis of genome sequences
revealed that an Alu element resides in the 5' region upstream of GSDMB. Reporter
assays using intact, deleted, and mutated Alu elements clearly showed that this
Alu element positively regulates GSDMB expression and that a putative IKZF
binding motif in this element is crucial to upregulate GSDMB expression.

Although childhood high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated
with a favorable outcome, 20% of patients still relapse. It is important to
identify these patients already at diagnosis to ensure proper risk
stratification. We have investigated 11 paired diagnostic and relapse samples
with single nucleotide polymorphism array and mutation analyses of FLT3, KRAS,
NRAS and PTPN11 in order to identify changes associated with relapse and to
ascertain the genetic evolution patterns. Structural changes, mainly cryptic
hemizygous deletions, were significantly more common at relapse (P<0.05). No
single aberration was linked to relapse, but four deletions, involving IKZF1,
PAX5, CDKN2A/B or AK3, were recurrent. On the basis of the genetic relationship
between the paired samples, three groups were delineated: (1) identical genetic
changes at diagnosis and relapse (2 of 11 cases), (2) clonal evolution with all
changes at diagnosis being present at relapse (2 of 11) and (3) clonal evolution 
with some changes conserved, lost or gained (7 of 11), suggesting the presence of
a preleukemic clone. This ancestral clone was characterized by numerical changes 
only, with structural changes and RTK-RAS mutations being secondary to the high
hyperdiploid pattern.

Mismatch repair and the downstream target genes, PAX5 and Ikaros, in childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Tyne, UK.

The mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is a post-replicative DNA repair process and
MMR deficiency is a common feature of ALL cell lines. In this study we have
investigated MMR deficiency in a large cohort of primary relapsed ALL (n=40) and 
investigated coding microsatellites (MS) of the lymphoid transcription factors,
PAX5 and IKZF1 as downstream target genes. Only one patient showed MMR
deficiency, as evidenced by microsatellite instability, which was acquired at
relapse and was associated with reduced expression of both MLH1 and MSH2. Coding 
MS in candidate target genes including PAX5, IKZF1, BAX and TGFBRII were all wild
type in this patient but the MMR-deficient cell line REH, was confirmed to have a
coding MS in both PAX5 and TGFBRII. Whilst MMR deficiency is not highly prevalent
in primary ALL, optimisation of the drug regimen to omit/replace thioguanines
should be considered for children with MMR deficiency and/or reduced expression
of key pathway components.

Mice that accurately model the genetic diversity found in human cancer are
valuable tools for interrogating disease mechanisms and investigating novel
therapeutic strategies. We performed insertional mutagenesis with the MOL4070LTR 
retrovirus in Mx1-Cre, Kras(G12D) mice and generated a large cohort of T lineage 
acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). Molecular analysis infers that retroviral
integration within Ikzf1 is an early event in leukemogenesis that precedes
Kras(G12D) expression and later acquisition of somatic Notch1 mutations.
Importantly, biochemical analysis uncovered unexpected heterogeneity, which
suggests that Ras signaling networks are remodeled during multistep
tumorigenesis. We tested tumor-derived cell lines to identify biomarkers of
therapeutic response to targeted inhibitors. Whereas all T-ALLs tested were
sensitive to a dual-specificity phosphoinosityl 3-kinase/mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitor, biochemical evidence of Notch1 activation correlated with
sensitivity to gamma-secretase inhibition. In addition, Kras(G12D) T-ALLs were
more responsive to a MAP/ERK kinase inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. Together,
these studies identify a genetic pathway involving Ikzf1, Kras(G12D), and Notch1 
in T lineage leukemogenesis, reveal unexpected diversity in Ras-regulated
signaling networks, and define biomarkers of drug responses that may inform
treatment strategies.

We conducted a genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) in a case-control study conducted in Korea. Incident childhood ALL
cases (n=50) and non-cancer controls (n=50) frequency-matched to cases by age and
sex, recruited from three teaching hospitals in Seoul between 2003 and 2008, were
genotyped using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 platform. ALL risks were estimated as
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age and birth
weight. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for adjusting multiple tests. Of

rs9388857, rs1360756, C2orf3 12105972, MAN2A1 rs3776932) were strongly associated
with childhood ALL risk (P(dominant)<or=0.0001 and P(trend)<0.006). These SNPs
remained significant after FDR adjustment (FDR value <0.2). Our genome-wide
association study in Korea children identified a few genetic variations as
potential susceptibility markers for ALL, warranting further replication studies 
among various ethnic groups.

Gene expression profiling of 207 uniformly treated children with high-risk
B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed 29 of 207 cases (14%) with
markedly elevated expression of CRLF2 (cytokine receptor-like factor 2). Each of 
the 29 cases harbored a genomic rearrangement of CRLF2: 18 of 29 (62%) had a
translocation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene IGH@ on 14q32 to CRLF2 in
the pseudoautosomal region 1 of Xp22.3/Yp11.3, whereas 10 (34%) cases had a
320-kb interstitial deletion centromeric of CRLF2, resulting in a P2RY8-CRLF2
fusion. One case had both IGH@-CRLF2 and P2RY8-CRLF2, and another had a novel
CRLF2 rearrangement. Only 2 of 29 cases were Down syndrome. CRLF2 rearrangements 
were significantly associated with activating mutations of JAK1 or JAK2, deletion
or mutation of IKZF1, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (Fisher exact test, P < .001 
for each). Within this cohort, patients with CRLF2 rearrangements had extremely
poor treatment outcomes compared with those without CRLF2 rearrangements (35.3%
vs 71.3% relapse-free survival at 4 years; P < .001). Together, these
observations suggest that activation of CRLF2 expression, mutation of JAK
kinases, and alterations of IKZF1 cooperate to promote B-cell leukemogenesis and 
identify these pathways as important therapeutic targets in this disease.

leukemia.

BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from the neoplastic
transformation of a haematopoietic stem cell. The hallmark genetic abnormality of
CML is a chimeric BCR/ABL1 fusion gene resulting from the Philadelphia chromosome
rearrangement t(9;22)(q34;q11). Clinical and laboratory studies indicate that the
BCR/ABL1 fusion protein is essential for initiation, maintenance and progression 
of CML, yet the event(s) driving the transformation from chronic phase to blast
phase are poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here we report multiple genome aberrations in a collection of 78 CML and
14 control samples by oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization. We
found a unique signature of genome deletions within the immunoglobulin heavy
chain (IGH) and T cell receptor regions (TCR), frequently accompanied by
concomitant loss of sequences within the short arm regions of chromosomes 7 and
9, including IKZF1, HOXA7, CDKN2A/2B, MLLT3, IFNA/B, RNF38, PAX5, JMJD2C and
PDCD1LG2 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: None of these genome losses were detected in any of the CML samples 
with myeloid transformation, chronic phase or controls, indicating that their
presence is obligatory for the development of a malignant clone with a lymphoid
phenotype. Notably, the coincidental deletions at IGH and TCR regions appear to
precede the loss of IKZF1 and/or p16 genes in CML indicating a possible
involvement of RAG in these deletions.

Recent genome-wide association data have implicated genetic variation at 7p12.2
(IKZF1), 10q21.2 (ARIDB5), and 14q11.2 (CEBPE) in the etiology of B-cell
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To verify and further examine the
relationship between these variants and ALL risk, we genotyped 1384 cases of
precursor B-cell childhood ALL and 1877 controls from Germany and the United
Kingdom. The combined data provided statistically significant support for an
association between genotype at each of these loci and ALL risk; odds ratios
(OR), 1.69 (P = 7.51 x10(-22)), 1.80 (P = 5.90 x 10(-28)), and 1.27 (P = 4.90 x
10(-6)), respectively. Furthermore, the risk of ALL increases with an increasing 
numbers of variant alleles for the 3 loci (OR(per-allele) = 1.53, 95% confidence 
interval, 1.44-1.62; P(trend) = 3.49 x 10(-42)), consistent with a polygenic
model of disease susceptibility. These data provide unambiguous evidence for the 
role of these variants in defining ALL risk underscoring approximately 64% of
cases.

Copy number losses in chromosome arm 9p are well-known aberrations in
malignancies, including leukemias. The CDKN2A gene is suggested to play a key
role in these aberrations. In this study overviewing 9p losses in hematologic
neoplasias, we introduce the term focal 9p instability to indicate multiple areas
of copy number loss or homozygous loss within a larger heterozygous one in 9p. We
have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization to study patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 140), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 50),
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 20), and myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 37).
Our results show that 9p instability is restricted to ALL. In total, 58/140 (41%)
patients with ALL had a loss in 9p. The 9p instability was detected in 19% of the
patients with ALL and always included homozygous loss of CDKN2A along with loss
of CDKN2B. Other possibly important genes included MTAP, IFN, MLLT3, JAK2,
PTPLAD2, and PAX5. 13/27 (48%) patients with the instability had the BCR/ABL1
fusion gene or other oncogene-activating translocation or structural aberrations.
Two patients had homozygous loss of hsa-mir -31, a microRNA known to regulate
IKZF1. IKZF1 deletion at 7p12.1 was seen in 10 (37%) patients with the 9p
instability. These findings suggest that, in ALL leukemogenesis, loss of CDKN2A
and other target genes in the instability region is frequently associated with
BCR/ABL1 and IKZF1 dysfunction. The multiple mechanisms leading to 9p instability
including physical or epigenetic loss of the target genes, loss of the microRNA
cluster, and the role of FRA9G fragile site are discussed.

To determine whether gene expression profiling could improve outcome prediction
in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at high risk for relapse, we 
profiled pretreatment leukemic cells in 207 uniformly treated children with
high-risk B-precursor ALL. A 38-gene expression classifier predictive of
relapse-free survival (RFS) could distinguish 2 groups with differing relapse
risks: low (4-year RFS, 81%, n = 109) versus high (4-year RFS, 50%, n = 98; P <
.001). In multivariate analysis, the gene expression classifier (P = .001) and
flow cytometric measures of minimal residual disease (MRD; P = .001) each
provided independent prognostic information. Together, they could be used to
classify children with high-risk ALL into low- (87% RFS), intermediate- (62%
RFS), or high- (29% RFS) risk groups (P < .001). A 21-gene expression classifier 
predictive of end-induction MRD effectively substituted for flow MRD, yielding a 
combined classifier that could distinguish these 3 risk groups at diagnosis (P < 
.001). These classifiers were further validated on an independent high-risk ALL
cohort (P = .006) and retainedindependent prognostic significance (P < .001) in
the presence of other recently described poor prognostic factors (IKAROS/IKZF1
deletions, JAK mutations, and kinase expression signatures). Thus, gene
expression classifiers improve ALL risk classification and allow prospective
identification of children who respond or fail current treatment regimens. These 
trials were registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov under NCT00005603.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of systemic lupus

1,205 controls using Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChips and replicating 78 SNPs in 
two additional cohorts (3,152 cases and 7,050 controls). We identified nine new
susceptibility loci (ETS1, IKZF1, RASGRP3, SLC15A4, TNIP1, 7q11.23, 10q11.22,
11q23.3 and 16p11.2; 1.77 x 10(-25) < or = P(combined) < or = 2.77 x 10(-8)) and 
confirmed seven previously reported loci (BLK, IRF5, STAT4, TNFAIP3, TNFSF4, 6q21
and 22q11.21; 5.17 x 10(-42) < or = P(combined) < or = 5.18 x 10(-12)).
Comparison with previous GWAS findings highlighted the genetic heterogeneity of
SLE susceptibility between Chinese Han and European populations. This study not
only advances our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE but also highlights
the value of performing GWAS in diverse ancestral populations.

The Ikaros (Ikzf1) gene, encoding a transcription regulator, is a major tumor
suppressor in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In the mouse, however,
loss of Ikaros is primarily associated with T-ALL development. Whether Ikaros is 
also implicated in human T-ALL remains unclear. We studied Ikaros in 25 human
T-ALL samples from diverse molecular subtypes at the mRNA, protein, sequence and 
genomic copy number level. We found that Ikaros was abnormal in only one sample: 
one allele was lost by genomic deletion, while proteins generated from the
remaining allele were delocalized and concentrated at a single cytoplasmic
structure. Thus, inactivation of Ikaros by deletion or mutation is rare in human 
T-ALL.

PURPOSE: The causes of the aggressive nature of BCR-ABL1-positive adult acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unknown. To identify, at the submicroscopic
level, oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed
an investigation of genomic copy number alterations using single nucleotide
polymorphism array, genomic polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of
candidate genes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with de novo adult Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph) -positive ALL were enrolled onto institutional (n = 17) or Gruppo
Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto Working Party delle Leucemia
Acute (n = 66) clinical trials. Treatments included tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) alone, conventional chemotherapy, or a combination of TKI and chemotherapy.
RESULTS: A 7p12 deletion of IKZF1 (Ikaros) was identified in 52 (63%) of 83
patients. The pattern of deletion varied among different patients, but the two
most common deletion types were loss of exons 4 to 7 in 31 (37%) of 83 patients
and loss of exons 2 to 7 in 17 (20%) of 83 patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) 
was shorter in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type 
(10 v 32 months, respectively; P = .02). Furthermore, a significantly shorter
cumulative incidence of relapse was recorded in patients with IKZF1 deletion
versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10.1 v 56.1 months, respectively; P =
.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the negative prognostic impact of IKZF1
deletion on DFS (P = .04).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that IKZF1 deletions are likely to be a genomic
alteration that significantly affects the prognosis of Ph-positive ALL in adults.

To identify risk variants for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we
conducted a genome-wide association study of two case-control series, analyzing
the genotypes with respect to 291,423 tagging SNPs in a total of 907 ALL cases
and 2,398 controls. We identified risk loci for ALL at 7p12.2 (IKZF1, rs4132601, 
odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 1.20 x 10(-19)), 10q21.2 (ARID5B, rs7089424, OR =
1.65, P = 6.69 x 10(-19)) and 14q11.2 (CEBPE, rs2239633, OR = 1.34, P = 2.88 x
10(-7)). The 10q21.2 (ARID5B) risk association appears to be selective for the
subset of B-cell precursor ALL with hyperdiploidy. These data show that common
low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing
childhood ALL and provide new insight into disease causation of this specific
hematological cancer. Notably, all three risk variants map to genes involved in
transcriptional regulation and differentiation of B-cell progenitors.

Using the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and publicly available genotypes, we
identified 18 SNPs whose allele frequency differed significantly(P < 1 x 10(-5)) 
between pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (n = 317) and non-ALL 
controls (n = 17,958). Two SNPs in ARID5B not only differed between ALL and
non-ALL groups (rs10821936, P = 1.4 x 10(-15), odds ratio (OR) = 1.91;
rs10994982, P = 5.7 x 10(-9), OR = 1.62) but also distinguished B-hyperdiploid
ALL from other subtypes (rs10821936, P = 1.62 x 10(-5), OR = 2.17; rs10994982, P 
= 0.003, OR 1.72). These ARID5B SNPs also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from
other subtypes in an independent validation cohort (n = 124 children with ALL; P 
= 0.003 and P = 0.0008, OR 2.45 and 2.86, respectively) and were associated with 
methotrexate accumulation and gene expression pattern in leukemic lymphoblasts.
We conclude that germline variants affect susceptibility to, and characteristics 
of, specific ALL subtypes.

B cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arises in virtually all cases
from B cell precursors that are arrested at pre-B cell receptor-dependent stages.
The Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) subtype of ALL accounts for 25-30%
of cases of adult ALL, has the most unfavorable clinical outcome among all ALL
subtypes and is defined by the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 kinase and deletions of the
IKAROS gene in >80% of cases. Here, we demonstrate that the pre-B cell receptor
functions as a tumor suppressor upstream of IKAROS through induction of cell
cycle arrest in Ph(+) ALL cells. Pre-B cell receptor-mediated cell cycle arrest
in Ph(+) ALL cells critically depends on IKAROS function, and is reversed by
coexpression of the dominant-negative IKAROS splice variant IK6. IKAROS also
promotes tumor suppression through cooperation with downstream molecules of the
pre-B cell receptor signaling pathway, even if expression of the pre-B cell
receptor itself is compromised. In this case, IKAROS redirects oncogenic BCR-ABL1
tyrosine kinase signaling from SRC kinase-activation to SLP65, which functions as
a critical tumor suppressor downstream of the pre-B cell receptor. These findings
provide a rationale for the surprisingly high frequency of IKAROS deletions in
Ph(+) ALL and identify IKAROS-mediated cell cycle exit as the endpoint of an
emerging pathway of pre-B cell receptor-mediated tumor suppression.

Helios is a member of the Ikaros family of zinc finger transcription factors. It 
is expressed mainly in T cells, where it associates with Ikaros-containing
complexes and has been proposed to act as a rate-limiting factor for Ikaros
function. Overexpression of wild-type or dominant-negative Helios isoforms
profoundly alters alphabeta T cell differentiation and activation, and endogenous
Helios is expressed at strikingly high levels in regulatory T cells. Helios has
also been implicated as a tumor suppressor in human T cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemias. These studies suggest a central role for Helios in T cell development 
and homeostasis, but whether this protein is physiologically required in T cells 
is unclear. We report herein that inactivation of the Helios gene by homologous
recombination does not impair the differentiation and effector cell function of
alphabeta and gammadelta T cells, NKT cells, and regulatory T cells. These
results suggest that Helios is not essential for T cells, and that its function
can be compensated for by other members of the Ikaros family.

The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene defines the subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) with the worst clinical prognosis. To identify oncogenic lesions that
combine with BCR-ABL1 to cause ALL, we used Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP
arrays (250K NspI and SNP 6.0), fluorescence in situ hybridization, and genomic
polymerase chain reaction to study 106 cases of adult BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. The 
most frequent somatic copy number alteration was a focal deletion on 7p12 of
IKZF1, which encodes the transcription factor Ikaros and was identified in 80
(75%) of 106 patients. Different patterns of deletions occurred, but the most
frequent were those characterized by a loss of exons 4 through 7 (Delta4-7) and
by removal of exons 2 through 7 (Delta2-7). A variable number of nucleotides
(patient specific) were inserted at the conjunction and maintained with fidelity 
at the time of relapse. The extent of the Delta4-7 deletion correlated with the
expression of a dominant-negative isoform with cytoplasmic localization and
oncogenic activity, whereas the Delta2-7 deletion resulted in a transcript
lacking the translation start site. The IKZF1 deletion also was identified in the
progression of chronic myeloid leukemia to lymphoid blast crisis (66%) but never 
in myeloid blast crisis or chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia or in patients 
with acute myeloid leukemia. Known DNA sequences and structural features were
mapped along the breakpoint cluster regions, including heptamer recombination
signal sequences recognized by RAG enzymes during V(D)J recombination, suggesting
that IKZF1 deletions could arise from aberrant RAG-mediated recombination.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease
consisting of distinct clinical and biological subtypes that are characterized by
specific chromosomal abnormalities or gene mutations. Mutation of genes encoding 
tyrosine kinases is uncommon in ALL, with the exception of Philadelphia
chromosome-positive ALL, where the t(9,22)(q34;q11) translocation encodes the
constitutively active BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. We recently identified a poor
prognostic subgroup of pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative ALL patients characterized by 
deletion of IKZF1 (encoding the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS) and a gene 
expression signature similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, raising the possibility of
activated tyrosine kinase signaling within this leukemia subtype. Here, we report
activating mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 (n = 3), JAK2 (n = 16), and JAK3
(n = 1) in 20 (10.7%) of 187 BCR-ABL1-negative, high-risk pediatric ALL cases.
The JAK1 and JAK2 mutations involved highly conserved residues in the kinase and 
pseudokinase domains and resulted in constitutive JAK-STAT activation and growth 
factor independence of Ba/F3-EpoR cells. The presence of JAK mutations was
significantly associated with alteration of IKZF1 (70% of all JAK-mutated cases
and 87.5% of cases with JAK2 mutations; P = 0.001) and deletion of CDKN2A/B (70% 
of all JAK-mutated cases and 68.9% of JAK2-mutated cases). The JAK-mutated cases 
had a gene expression signature similar to BCR-ABL1 pediatric ALL, and they had a
poor outcome. These results suggest that inhibition of JAK signaling is a logical
target for therapeutic intervention in JAK mutated ALL.

Ikaros controls isotype selection during immunoglobulin class switch
recombination.

Class switch recombination (CSR) allows the humoral immune response to exploit
different effector pathways through specific secondary antibody isotypes.
However, the molecular mechanisms and factors that control immunoglobulin (Ig)
isotype choice for CSR are unclear. We report that deficiency for the Ikaros
transcription factor results in increased and ectopic CSR to IgG(2b) and IgG(2a),
and reduced CSR to all other isotypes, regardless of stimulation. Ikaros
suppresses active chromatin marks, transcription, and activation-induced cytidine
deaminase (AID) accessibility at the gamma2b and gamma2a genes to inhibit class
switching to these isotypes. Further, Ikaros directly regulates isotype gene
transcription as it directly binds the Igh 3' enhancer and interacts with isotype
gene promoters. Finally, Ikaros-mediated repression of gamma2b and gamma2a
transcription promotes switching to other isotype genes by allowing them to
compete for AID-mediated recombination at the single-cell level. Thus, our
results reveal transcriptional competition between constant region genes in
individual cells to be a critical and general mechanism for isotype specification
during CSR. We show that Ikaros is a master regulator of this competition.

The Mi-2/NuRD complex associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin during S
phase in rapidly proliferating lymphoid cells.

Chromosomal replication results in the duplication not only of DNA sequence but
also of the patterns of histone modification, DNA methylation, and nucleoprotein 
structure that constitute epigenetic information. Pericentromeric heterochromatin
in human cells is characterized by unique patterns of histone and DNA
modification. Here, we describe association of the Mi-2/NuRD complex with
specific segments of pericentromeric heterochromatin consisting of Satellite
II/III DNA located on human chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 in some but not all cell
types. This association is linked in part to DNA replication and chromatin
assembly and may suggest a role in these processes. Mi-2/NuRD accumulation is
independent of Polycomb association and is characterized by a unique pattern of
histone modification. We propose that Mi-2/NuRD constitutes an enzymatic
component of a pathway for assembly and maturation of chromatin utilized by
rapidly proliferating lymphoid cells for replication of constitutive
heterochromatin.

Ikaros stability and pericentromeric localization are regulated by protein
phosphatase 1.

Ikaros encodes a zinc finger protein that is involved in gene regulation and
chromatin remodeling. The majority of Ikaros localizes at pericentromeric
heterochromatin (PC-HC) where it regulates expression of target genes. Ikaros
function is controlled by posttranslational modification. Phosphorylation of
Ikaros by CK2 kinase determines its ability to bind DNA and exert cell cycle
control as well as its subcellular localization. We report that Ikaros interacts 
with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) via a conserved PP1 binding motif, RVXF, in the 
C-terminal end of the Ikaros protein. Point mutations of the RVXF motif abolish
Ikaros-PP1 interaction and result in decreased DNA binding, an inability to
localize to PC-HC, and rapid degradation of the Ikaros protein. The introduction 
of alanine mutations at CK2-phosphorylated residues increases the half-life of
the PP1-nonbinding Ikaros mutant. This suggests that dephosphorylation of these
sites by PP1 stabilizes the Ikaros protein and prevents its degradation. In the
nucleus, Ikaros forms complexes with ubiquitin, providing evidence that Ikaros
degradation involves the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In vivo, Ikaros can target
PP1 to the nucleus, and a fraction of PP1 colocalizes with Ikaros at PC-HC. These
data suggest a novel function for the Ikaros protein; that is, the targeting of
PP1 to PC-HC and other chromatin structures. We propose a model whereby the
function of Ikaros is controlled by the CK2 and PP1 pathways and that a balance
between these two signal transduction pathways is essential for normal cellular
function and for the prevention of malignant transformation.

BACKGROUND: Genetic subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are used to
determine risk and treatment in children. 25% of precursor B-ALL cases are
genetically unclassified and have intermediate prognosis. We aimed to use a
genome-wide study to improve prognostic classification of ALL in children.
METHODS: We constructed a classifier based on gene expression in 190 children
with newly diagnosed ALL (German Cooperative ALL [COALL] discovery cohort) by use
of double-loop cross-validation and validated this in an independent cohort of
107 newly diagnosed patients (Dutch Childhood Oncology Group [DCOG] independent
validation cohort). Hierarchical cluster analysis with classifying gene-probe
sets revealed a new ALL subtype, the underlying genetic abnormalities of which
were characterised by comparative genomic hybridisation-arrays and molecular
cytogenetics.
FINDINGS: Our classifier predicted ALL subtype with a median accuracy of 90.0%
(IQR 88.3-91.7) in the discovery cohort and correctly identified 94 of 107
patients (accuracy 87.9%) in the independent validation cohort. Without our
classifier, 44 children in the COALL cohort and 33 children in the DCOG cohort
would have been classified as B-other. However, hierarchical clustering showed
that many of these genetically unclassified cases clustered with
BCR-ABL1-positive cases: 30 (19%) of 154 children with precursor B-ALL in the
COALL cohort and 14 (15%) of 92 children with precursor B-ALL in the DCOG cohort 
had this BCR-ABL1-like disease. In the COALL cohort, these patients had
unfavourable outcome (5-year disease-free survival 59.5%, 95% CI 37.1-81.9)
compared with patients with other precursor B-ALL (84.4%, 76.8-92.1%; p=0.012), a
prognosis similar to that of patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL (51.9%,
23.1-80.6%). In the DCOG cohort, the prognosis of BCR-ABL1-like disease (57.1%,
31.2-83.1%) was worse than that of other precursor B-ALL (79.2%, 70.2-88.3%;
p=0.026), and similar to that of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL (32.5%, 2.3-62.7%). 36
(82%) of the patients with BCR-ABL1-like disease had deletions in genes involved 
in B-cell development, including IKZF1, TCF3, EBF1, PAX5, and VPREB1; only nine
(36%) of 25 patients with B-other ALL had deletions in these genes (p=0.0002).
Compared with other precursor B-ALL cells, BCR-ABL1-like cells were 73 times more
resistant to L-asparaginase (p=0.001) and 1.6 times more resistant to
daunorubicin (p=0.017), but toxicity of prednisolone and vincristine did not
differ.
INTERPRETATION: New treatment strategies are needed to improve outcome for this
newly identified high-risk subtype of ALL.

Differential expression of Ikaros isoforms in monozygotic twins with
MLL-rearranged precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Infant leukemia associated with rearrangement of the MLL gene typically presents 
with high-risk clinical features. Relapse is common despite aggressive therapy
and perturbations in signaling pathways may contribute to disease resistance. We 
evaluated twin 4-month-old monozygotic baby boys who presented with
MLL-rearranged precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two different MLL/AF4
variants were found in both the twins, the first involving MLL intron 8 and AF4
intron 3 and the second stemming from translocations of MLL exon 10 and AF4 exon 
4. We detected expression of the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms, Ik1, Ikx+, Ik2 and 
the dominant-negative Ik4 Ikaros isoform in both patients. However, the
dominant-negative Ik8 isoform was detected in only 1 boy, suggesting a common
genetic ontogeny that was modulated by leukemic evolution. Further exploration of
Ikaros expression in the background of MLL rearrangements may provide new
insights into disease pathogenesis and could offer targets for novel
chemotherapeutic agents.

BACKGROUND: Despite best current therapy, up to 20% of pediatric patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a relapse. Recent genomewide analyses
have identified a high frequency of DNA copy-number abnormalities in ALL, but the
prognostic implications of these abnormalities have not been defined.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of 221 children with high-risk B-cell-progenitor ALL
with the use of single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarrays, transcriptional
profiling, and resequencing of samples obtained at diagnosis. Children with known
very-high-risk ALL subtypes (i.e., BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, hypodiploid ALL, and
ALL in infants) were excluded from this cohort. A copy-number abnormality was
identified as a predictor of poor outcome, and it was then tested in an
independent validation cohort of 258 patients with B-cell-progenitor ALL.
RESULTS: More than 50 recurring copy-number abnormalities were identified, most
commonly involving genes that encode regulators of B-cell development (in 66.8%
of patients in the original cohort); PAX5 was involved in 31.7% and IKZF1 in
28.6% of patients. Using copy-number abnormalities, we identified a predictor of 
poor outcome that was validated in the independent validation cohort. This
predictor was strongly associated with alteration of IKZF1, a gene that encodes
the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS. The gene-expression signature of the
group of patients with a poor outcome revealed increased expression of
hematopoietic stem-cell genes and reduced expression of B-cell-lineage genes, and
it was similar to the signature of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, another high-risk
subtype of ALL with a high frequency of IKZF1 deletion.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alteration of IKZF1 is associated with a very poor outcome
in B-cell-progenitor ALL.

Mostly studied in murine models, Ikaros--a factor that positively or negatively
controls gene transcription--was first described as essential to lymphopoiesis
until its involvement in numerous hematopoietic lineages was documented. Indeed, 
Ikaros is also active in murine erythropoiesis and more precisely during fetal to
adult globin switching. Recently, these observations were confirmed by our team
in a human context. We here review some of the most important characteristics of 
Ikaros, and detail more precisely how defects of Ikaros activity either by gene
inactivation or mutation in mice, or by forced expression of dominant negative
isoforms in human precursor cells, modify the erythroid differentiation. An
increased cell death, together with decreased cell proliferation, decreased
expression of erythroid-specific genes including GATA1, and a delay in fetal to
adult globin switching were observed. At the same time, myeloid differentiation
was slightly favoured thus suggesting that Ikaros could be involved in the
control of the myeloid/erythroid commitment.

During development and erythropoiesis, globin gene expression is finely modulated
through an important network of transcription factors and chromatin modifying
activities. In this report we provide in vivo evidence that endogenous Ikaros is 
recruited to the human beta-globin locus and targets the histone deacetylase
HDAC1 and the chromatin remodeling protein Mi-2 to the human gamma-gene
promoters, thereby contributing to gamma-globin gene silencing at the time of the
gamma- to beta-globin gene transcriptional switch. We show for the first time
that Ikaros interacts with GATA-1 and enhances the binding of the latter to
different regulatory regions across the locus. Consistent with these results, we 
show that the combinatorial effect of Ikaros and GATA-1 impairs close proximity
between the locus control region and the human gamma-globin genes. Since the
absence of Ikaros also affects GATA-1 recruitment to GATA-2 promoter, we propose 
that the combinatorial effect of Ikaros and GATA-1 is not restricted to globin
gene regulation.

BACKGROUND: Ikaros is the prototypic member of a Kruppel-like zinc finger
transcription factor subfamily that is required for normal hematopoietic cell
differentiation and proliferation, particularly in the lymphoid lineages.
Alternative splicing can generate multiple Ikaros isoforms that lack different
numbers of exons and have different functions. Shorter isoforms, which lack the
amino-terminal domain that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding, exert a
dominant negative effect and inhibit the ability of longer heterodimer partners
to bind DNA.
DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a high-throughput capillary
electrophoresis sizing method to detect and quantify different Ikaros cDNA
transcripts.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cells expressed high levels of the non-DNA-binding isoform
Ik6 that was generated following IKZF1 genomic deletions (19/46 patients, 41%).
Furthermore, a recurring 60 bp insertion immediately upstream of exon 5, at the
exon 3/exon 5 junction, was frequently detected in the Ik2 and Ik4 isoforms. This
insertion occurred either alone or together with an in-frame ten amino acid
deletion that was due to a 30 bp loss at the end of exon 7. Both the alterations 
are due to the selection of alternative cryptic splice sites and have been
suggested to cause impaired DNA-binding activity. Non-DNA-binding isoforms were
localized in the cytoplasm whereas the DNA-binding isoforms were localized in the
nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that both aberrant splicing and genomic
deletion leading to different non-DNA-binding Ikaros cDNA transcripts are common 
features of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Odd-skipped related 1 gene expression is regulated by Runx2 and Ikzf1
transcription factors.

Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita-Osaka 565-0871, Japan.

Odd-skipped related 1 (Osr1) gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that
plays important roles in embryonic, heart, and urogenital development, however,
it is unknown how its expression is regulated. In this study, we analyzed the
promoter region of Osr1 to elucidate its regulation mechanism. The mouse Osr1
promoter region was cloned and characterized, and found to have two repressor
elements in the -4504/-2766 and -1616/-109 regions, and two enhancer elements in 
the -2766/-1616 and -109/+199 regions. Several Runx2 and Ikzf1 binding sites were
found in both mouse and human Osr1 promoters. Osr1 promoter activity was
suppressed by cotransfection with Runx2- and Ikzf1-expressing vectors in a
dose-dependent manner. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays showed that purified
Runx2 bound to proximal (-611/-606) Runx2 binding motifs and that Ikzf1 bound to 
proximal (-1652/-1644) Ikzf1 binding motifs. Chrosmatin immunoprecipitation
demonstrated that Runx2 bound to both the distal (-3047/-3042) and proximal
regions, and that Ikzf1 bound to both the far-distal (-3036/-3028) and proximal
elements. These findings indicate that Osr1 expression is regulated by Runx2 and 
Ikzf1, which are known as master-gene of osteogenesis and hematopoiesis,
respectively.

We characterized intrinsic and extrinsic specification of progenitors in the
lateral and medial ganglionic eminences (LGE and MGE). We identified seven genes 
whose expression is enriched or restricted in either the LGE [biregional cell
adhesion molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes binding protein (Boc),
Frizzled homolog 8 (Fzd8), Ankrd43 (ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 43),
and Ikzf1 (Ikaros family zinc finger 1)] or MGE [Map3k12 binding inhibitory
protein 1 (Mbip); zinc-finger, SWIM domain containing 5 (Zswim5); and Adamts5 [a 
disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 
1 motif, 5]]. Boc, Fzd8, Mbip, and Zswim5 are apparently expressed in LGE or MGE 
progenitors, whereas the remaining three are seen in the postmitotic mantle zone.
Relative expression levels are altered and regional distinctions are lost for
each gene in LGE or MGE cells propagated as neurospheres, indicating that these
newly identified molecular characteristics of LGE or MGE progenitors depend on
forebrain signals not available in the neurosphere assay. Analyses of
Pax6(Sey/Sey), Shh(-/-), and Gli3(XtJ/XtJ) mutants suggests that LGE and MGE
progenitor identity does not rely exclusively on previously established
forebrain-intrinsic patterning mechanisms. Among a limited number of additional
potential patterning mechanisms, we found that extrinsic signals from the
frontonasal mesenchyme are essential for Shh- and Fgf8-dependent regulation of
LGE and MGE genes. Thus, extrinsic and intrinsic forebrain patterning mechanisms 
cooperate to establish LGE and MGE progenitor identity, and presumably their
capacities to generate distinct classes of neuronal progeny.

The underlying pathways that lead to relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) are unknown. To comprehensively characterize the molecular
evolution of relapsed childhood B-precursor ALL, we used human 500K
single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to identify somatic copy number alterations
(CNAs) in 20 diagnosis/relapse pairs relative to germ line. We identified 758
CNAs, 66.4% of which were less than 1 Mb, and deletions outnumbered
amplifications by approximately 2.5:1. Although CNAs persisting from diagnosis to
relapse were observed in all 20 cases, 17 patients exhibited differential CNA
patterns from diagnosis to relapse. Of the 396 CNAs observed in 20 relapse
samples, only 69 (17.4%) were novel (absent in the matched diagnosis samples).
EBF1 and IKZF1 deletions were particularly frequent in this relapsed ALL cohort
(25.0% and 35.0%, respectively), suggesting their role in disease recurrence. In 
addition, we noted concordance in global gene expression and DNA copy number
changes (P = 2.2 x 10(-16)). Finally, relapse-specific focal deletion of MSH6
and, consequently, reduced gene expression were found in 2 of 20 cases. In an
independent cohort of children with ALL, reduced expression of MSH6 was
associated with resistance to mercaptopurine and prednisone, thereby providing a 
plausible mechanism by which this acquired deletion contributes to drug
resistance at relapse.

It's T-ALL about Notch.

19104, USA.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive subset of ALL with
poor clinical outcome compared to B-ALL. Therefore, to improve treatment, it is
imperative to delineate the molecular blueprint of this disease. This review
describes the central role that the Notch pathway plays in T-ALL development. We 
also discuss the interactions between Notch and the tumor suppressors Ikaros and 
p53. Loss of Ikaros, a direct repressor of Notch target genes, and suppression of
p53-mediated apoptosis are essential for development of this neoplasm. In
addition to the activating mutations of Notch previously described, this review
will outline combinations of mutations in pathways that contribute to Notch
signaling and appear to drive T-ALL development by 'mimicking' Notch effects on
cell cycle and apoptosis.

Ikaros plays an important role in the control of differentiation and
proliferation of all lymphoid lineages. The expression of short isoforms lacking 
DNA-binding motifs alters the differentiation capacities of hematopoietic
progenitors, arresting lineage commitment. We sought to determine whether
molecular abnormalities involving the IKZF1 gene were associated with resistance 
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
patients. Using reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and
nucleotide sequencing, only the non-DNA-binding Ik6 isoform was detected in 49%
of Ph+ ALL patients. Ik6 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm versus
DNA-binding Ik1 or Ik2 isoforms, which showed nuclear localization. There was a
strong correlation between nonfunctional Ikaros isoforms and BCR-ABL transcript
level. Furthermore, patient-derived leukemia cells expressed oncogenic Ikaros
isoforms before TKI treatment, but not during response to TKIs, and predominantly
at the time of relapse. In vitro overexpression of Ik6 strongly increased DNA
synthesis and inhibited apoptosis in TKI-sensitive cells. Genomic sequence and
computational analyses of exon splice junction regions of IKZF1 in Ph+ ALL
patients predicted several mutations that may alter alternative splicing. These
results establish a previously unknown link between specific molecular defects
that involve alternative splicing of the IKZF1 gene and the resistance to TKIs in
Ph+ ALL patients.

Instructive role of the transcription factor E2A in early B lymphopoiesis and
germinal center B cell development.

The transcription factor E2A controls the initiation of B lymphopoiesis, which is
arrested at the pre-pro-B cell stage in E2A-deficient mice. Here, we demonstrate 
by conditional mutagenesis that E2A is essential for the development of pro-B,
pre-B, and immature B cells in the bone marrow. E2A is, however, dispensable for 
the generation of mature B cells and plasma cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. 
In contrast, germinal center B cell development is impaired in the absence of E2A
despite normal AID expression and class-switch recombination. Molecular analysis 
revealed that E2A is required not only for initiating but also for maintaining
the expression of Ebf1, Pax5, and the B cell gene program in pro-B cells.
Notably, precocious Pax5 transcription from the Ikzf1 locus promotes pro-B cell
development in E2A-deficient mice, demonstrating that ectopic Pax5 expression is 
sufficient to activate the B lymphoid transcription program in vivo in the
absence of E2A.

Ikaros modulates cholesterol uptake: a link between tumor suppression and
differentiation.

Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Ikaros is a transcription factor that directs lymphoid lineage commitment and
pituitary neuroendocrine cell expansion and function. Here, we show that Ikaros
regulates the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) to alter metabolism in
pituitary corticotroph cells. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoform Ik1 binds and
enhances activity of the LDL-R promoter. Ik1 decreases methylation and increases 
acetylation of histone H3 (Lys(9)) at the LDL-R promoter. Confocal microscopy and
quantitative fluorometry show enhanced LDL endocytosis in Ik1-transfected cells
that exhibit abundant endoplasmic reticulum, large Golgi complexes, and prominent
secretory granule formation, consistent with more robust cholesterol
incorporation into functionally relevant membrane-rich organelles. Consistent
with these data, LDL-R(-/-) mice, like Ik(-/-) mice, have decreased circulating
levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone. These findings expand the repertoire of
Ikaros actions to include regulation of the cholesterol uptake metabolic pathway 
with therapeutic implications for lipid-modifying drugs in Ikaros-associated
cancers.

We present here a genome-wide map of abnormalities found in diagnostic samples
from 45 adults and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A 500K
SNP array analysis uncovered frequent genetic abnormalities, with cryptic
deletions constituting half of the detected changes, implying that microdeletions
are a characteristic feature of this malignancy. Importantly, the pattern of
deletions resembled that recently reported in pediatric ALL, suggesting that
adult, adolescent, and childhood cases may be more similar on the genetic level
than previously thought. Thus, 70% of the cases displayed deletion of one or more
of the CDKN2A, PAX5, IKZF1, ETV6, RB1, and EBF1 genes. Furthermore, several genes
not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of ALL were identified as possible 
recurrent targets of deletion. In total, the SNP array analysis identified 367
genetic abnormalities not corresponding to known copy number polymorphisms, with 
all but two cases (96%) displaying at least one cryptic change. The resolution
level of this SNP array study is the highest used to date to investigate a
malignant hematologic disorder. Our findings provide insights into the
leukemogenic process and may be clinically important in adult and adolescent ALL.
Most importantly, we report that microdeletions of key genes appear to be a
common, characteristic feature of ALL that is shared among different clinical,
morphological, and cytogenetic subgroups.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes BCR-ABL1, is 
the defining lesion of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and a subset of acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with
BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed a genome-wide analysis of diagnostic
leukaemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43 BCR-ABL1
B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1 (encoding the transcription factor
Ikaros) was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but not in chronic-phase CML.
Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an acquired lesion at the time of
transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions
resulted in haploinsufficiency, expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform,
or the complete loss of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion
breakpoints suggested that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination is responsible for
the deletions. These findings suggest that genetic lesions resulting in the loss 
of Ikaros function are an important event in the development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Real-time PCR analysis of candidate imprinted genes on mouse chromosome 11 shows 
balanced expression from the maternal and paternal chromosomes and
strain-specific variation in expression levels.

Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed from either the maternal or
paternal genome. Because cancer develops through genetic and epigenetic
alterations, imprinted genes affect tumorigenesis depending on which parental
allele undergoes alteration. We have shown previously in a mouse model of
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that inheriting mutant alleles of Nf1 and Trp53 on
chromosome 11 from the mother or father dramatically changes the tumor spectrum
of mutant progeny, likely due to alteration in an imprinted gene(s) linked to Nf1
and Trp53. In order to identify imprinted genes on chromosome 11 that are
responsible for differences in susceptibility, we tested candidate imprinted
genes predicted by a bioinformatics approach and an experimental approach. We
have tested 30 candidate genes (Havcr2, Camk2b, Ccdc85a, Cntnap1, Ikzf1,
5730522E02Rik, Gria1, Zfp39, Sgcd, Jup, Nxph3, Spnb2, Asb3, Rasd1, Map2k3,

Smarce1, Stat3, Atp6v0a1, Nbr1 and Meox1), two known imprinted genes (Grb10 and
Impact) and Nf1, which has not been previously identified as an imprinted gene.
Although we confirmed the imprinting of Grb10 and Impact, we found no other genes
imprinted in the brain. We did, however, find strain-biased expression of Camk2b,
5730522E02Rik, Havcr2, Map2k3, Serpinf1, Rasl10b, Itga3, Asb3, Trp53, Nf1,
Smarce1, Stat3, Cbx1, Pparbp and Cntnap1. These results suggest that the
prediction of imprinted genes is complicated and must be individually validated.

The leukemogenic CALM/AF10 fusion protein alters the subcellular localization of 
the lymphoid regulator Ikaros.

The t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation leads to the fusion of the CALM and AF10
genes. This translocation can be found as the sole cytogenetic abnormality in
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and in malignant lymphomas. 
The expression of CALM/AF10 in primary murine bone marrow cells results in the
development of an aggressive leukemia in a murine bone marrow transplantation
model. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the lymphoid regulator
Ikaros as an AF10 interacting protein. Interestingly, Ikaros is required for
normal development of lymphocytes, and aberrant expression of Ikaros has been
found in leukemia. In a murine model, the expression of a dominant negative
isoform of Ikaros causes leukemias and lymphomas. The Ikaros interaction domain
of AF10 was mapped to the leucine zipper domain of AF10, which is required for
malignant transformation both by the CALM/AF10 and the MLL/AF10 fusion proteins. 
The interaction between AF10 and Ikaros was confirmed by GST pull down and
co-immunoprecipitation. Coexpression of CALM/AF10 but not of AF10 alters the
subcellular localization of Ikaros in murine fibroblasts. The transcriptional
repressor activity of Ikaros is reduced by AF10. These results suggest that
CALM/AF10 might interfere with normal Ikaros function, and thereby block lymphoid
differentiation in CALM/AF10 positive leukemias.

Promoter analysis of human glutamate carboxypeptidase II.

Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital, 115 Mill Street, Belmont,
MA 02478, USA.

The expression of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II) is reduced in selective 
brain regions in schizophrenic patients. To investigate transcriptional
mechanisms regulating the human GCP II gene, a 3460 bp DNA fragment comprised of 
the proximal 3228 bp of 5' untranscribed sequence and first 232 bp of 5' UTR
portion of this gene was cloned into the mammalian luciferase reporter gene
vector pGL3-Basic. Transfection assays in human astrocyte-derived SVG and human
prostate tumor-derived LNCaP cells demonstrated that constructs with 3460, 1590
and 761 bp portions of 5' region of human GCP II gene were able to drive the
luciferase reporter gene. Additional deletion constructs showed that in the SVG
cell line, constructs with 511 and 411 bp of GCP II gene fragments yielded
highest transcriptional activity, with declining activity upon further removal of
5' sequences. 15 bp of the promoter 5' to a 225 bp GCP II fragment were essential
for luciferase expression. Thus, in the SVG cells, the proximal 240 bp of the
human GCP II promoter (232 bp of the 5' UTR and 8 bp of 5' untranscribed
sequences) may represent the core promoter. Further, while a LyF-1 site lies
within and overlaps a transcription start site in the 15 bp sequence,
site-directed mutagenesis shows that LyF-1 is not the transcription initiator for
the "TATA and CAAT" box lacking GCP II gene in the SVG cells. Finally, pattern
differences in GCP II gene promoter expression in SVG and LNCaP cells suggest
that sequences beyond 240 bp may be important for tissue-specific GCP II
expression.

Predominant interaction of both Ikaros and Helios with the NuRD complex in
immature thymocytes.

Sridharan R(1), Smale ST.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Microbiology, Immunology,
and Molecular Genetics, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.

Ikaros is the founding member of a small family of C2H2 zinc-finger DNA-binding
proteins that carry out critical functions during lymphocyte development.
Although interactions between Ikaros and various proteins have been reported,
Ikaros-containing complexes have not been purified to determine their composition
and identify the predominant interacting partners. In this study, a tandem
affinity purification-mass spectrometry strategy was developed for the isolation 
of complexes formed by Ikaros and by Helios, a T-cell-restricted member of the
Ikaros family that remains largely uncharacterized. This strategy, which appears 
to be well suited for general use in mammalian cells, relies on an N-terminal
polypeptide containing a double FLAG epitope, followed by a tobacco etch virus
protease cleavage site and calmodulin binding peptide. In extracts from a murine 
thymocyte line, Ikaros and Helios associated under moderate stringency conditions
only with other members of the Ikaros family. However, under low stringency
conditions, both tagged proteins assembled into higher molecular weight
complexes. Mass spectrometry revealed that both proteins associated predominantly
with subunits of NuRD, an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex implicated 
in transcriptional repression and activation and previously reported to associate
with Ikaros. Further analysis of the affinity-purified Ikaros revealed that
several serines and threonines are phosphorylated in the thymocyte line, with
apparent changes upon thymocyte maturation. These results support the hypothesis 
that the NuRD complex makes major contributions to the functions of both Ikaros
and Helios and that the activities of these proteins may be regulated in part by 
changes in phosphorylation.

Induction of alkaline phosphatase activity by L-ascorbic acid in human
osteoblastic cells: a potential role for CK2 and Ikaros.

Son E(1), Do H, Joo HM, Pyo S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Herbal Medicine Resource, Institute of Bioscience and
Biotechnology, Kangwon National University, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of L-ascorbic acid (AsA) on osteoblast
differentiation, we examined the effects of AsA on in vitro osteoblastic
differentiation markers such as collagen synthesis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity, and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and
osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression. The role of Ikaros and casein kinase 2 (CK2) in
regulating osteoblast differentiation was also determined.
METHODS: This study examined the expression of RANKL and OPG, collagen synthesis,
and ALP activity in AsA-treated osteoblast-like cells (MG63) using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and biochemical assays. In addition,
Ikaros activity and CK2 expression were assessed by electrophoretic mobility
shift assays and western blot assays, respectively.
RESULTS: The results showed that AsA treatment slightly downregulated OPG mRNA
expression, whereas the mRNA expression of RANKL and collagen was unaffected. AsA
significantly increased ALP activity after 4 d, and this activation was inhibited
by the CK2 inhibitors, 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole and
5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazimidazole. Small interfering
RNA-mediated depletion of CK2-alpha also decreased ALP activity in AsA-stimulated
cells. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that AsA induced the activation of 
CK2. AsA dose-dependently decreased the DNA binding affinity of the transcription
factor Ikaros, which is a bifunctional differentiation factor. Moreover, cells
treated with AsA and CK2 inhibitor exhibited increased Ikaros activity compared
with those treated with AsA alone.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AsA stimulates osteoblastic
differentiation by enhancing ALP activity and suppressing Ikaros activity.
Moreover, this process might be related to CK2 regulation.

Hematological changes induced by various stress stimuli are accompanied by
replacement of the primary acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 3' splice variant
acetylcholinesterase-S (AChE-S) with the myelopoietic acetylcholinesterase-R
(AChE-R) variant. To search for putative acetylcholinesterase-S interactions with
hematopoietic pathways, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen. The
transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) was identified as 
a protein partner of the AChE-S C terminus. In erythroleukemic K562 cells, AChE-S
displayed nuclear colocalization and physical interaction with CtBP. Furthermore,
co-transfected AChE-S reduced the co-repressive effect of CtBP over the
hematopoietic transcription factor, Ikaros. In transgenic mice, overexpressed
human (h) AChE-S mRNA induced selective bone marrow upregulation of Ikaros while 
suppressing FOG, another transcriptional partner of CtBP. Transgenic bone marrow 
cells showed a correspondingly elevated potential for producing progenitor
colonies, compared with controls, while peripheral blood showed increased
erythrocyte counts as opposed to reduced platelets, granulocytes and T
lymphocytes. AChE's 3' alternative splicing, and the corresponding changes in
AChE-S/CtBP interactions, thus emerge as being actively involved in controlling
hematopoiesis and the potential for modulating immune functions, supporting
reports on malfunctioning immune reactions under impaired splice site selection.

Gross cytogenetic anomalies are traditionally being used as diagnostic,
prognostic and therapeutic markers in the clinical management of cancer,
including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recently, it has become
increasingly clear that genetic lesions driving tumorigenesis frequently occur at
the submicroscopic level and, consequently, escape standard cytogenetic
observations. Therefore, we profiled the genomes of 40 childhood ALLs at high
resolution. We detected multiple de novo genetic lesions, including gross
aneuploidies and segmental gains and losses, some of which were subtle and
affected single genes. Many of these lesions involved recurrent (partially)
overlapping deletions and duplications, containing various established
leukemia-associated genes, such as ETV6, RUNX1 and MLL. Importantly, the most
frequently affected genes were those controlling G1/S cell cycle progression
(e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN1B and RB1), followed by genes associated with B-cell
development. The latter group includes microdeletions of the B-lineage
transcription factors PAX5, EBF, E2-2 and IKZF1 (Ikaros), as well as genes with
other established roles in B-cell development, that is RAG1 and RAG2, FYN, PBEF1 
or CBP/PAG. The fact that we frequently encountered multiple lesions affecting
genes involved in cell cycle regulation and B-cell differentiation strongly
suggests that both these processes need to be targeted independently and
simultaneously to trigger ALL development.

autoimmunity but not leukemogenesis.

Ikaros is a transcriptional regulator whose function is essential for B cell
development. It is expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) through the
mature B cell stage. Using genetically engineered mice in which the endogenous
Ikaros gene is disrupted, it has been shown that a lack of Ikaros leads to a
block in B cell development and that its severe diminution results in a
hyperresponsive B cell compartment. Ikaros expression within the HSC has led to
speculation as to whether the role of Ikaros in B cell biology is largely
accomplished prior to B cell specification. In addition, widespread expression of
Ikaros in hematopoietic cells leads to the possibility that some or all of the
observed defects are not B cell autonomous. In this report, we demonstrate that
over-expression of a dominant interfering Ikaros isoform exclusively in B cells
has profound effects on mature B cell function. We provide evidence that
continued high-level expression of Ikaros is essential for homeostasis of
peripheral lymphocytes and maintenance of B cell tolerance. We also show that
deregulation of Ikaros activity does not rapidly result in B cell leukemogenesis 
as it does with 100% penetrance within the T cell lineage.

Chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but
alone fail to induce leukaemia. To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions, we
performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL
patients using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic
DNA sequencing. Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and
structural rearrangement in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene
was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of
cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted in reduced levels of PAX5 protein
or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions were also detected in TCF3
(also known as E2A), EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 (IKAROS) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS). These
findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell
development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis.
Moreover, these data demonstrate the power of high-resolution, genome-wide
approaches to identify new molecular lesions in cancer.

Chromosomal translocations joining the immunoglobulin (IG) and MYC genes have
been extensively reported in Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's lymphomas but data
concerning MYC rearrangements with non-IG partners are scarce. In this study,
8q24 breakpoints from 17 B-cell lymphomas involving non-IG loci were mapped by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In seven cases the breakpoint was
inside a small region encompassing MYC: in one t(7;8)(p12;q24) and two
t(3;8)(q27;q24), it was telomeric to MYC whereas in four cases, one
t(2;8)(p15;q24) and three t(8;9)(q24;p13) it was located in a 85 kb region
encompassing MYC. In these seven cases, partner regions identified by FISH
contained genes known to be involved in lymphomagenesis, namely BCL6, BCL11A,
PAX5 and IKAROS. Breakpoints were cloned in two t(8;9)(q24;p13), 2.5 and 7 kb
downstream from MYC and several hundred kb 5' to PAX5 on chromosome 9, joining
MYC to ZCCHC7 and to ZBTB5 exon 2, two genes encoding zinc-finger proteins. In
these seven cases, MYC expression measured by quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was significantly higher when
compared to that of patients without 8q24 rearrangement (P=0.006). These results 
suggest that these rearrangements are the consequence of a non-random process
targeting MYC together with non-IG genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation
and lymphoma progression.

Human Ikaros function in activated T cells is regulated by coordinated expression
of its largest isoforms.

Author information: 
(1)Mattel Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.

The Ikaros gene is alternately spliced to generate multiple zinc finger proteins 
involved in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. Whereas murine studies have
provided important information regarding the role of Ikaros in the mouse, little 
is known of Ikaros function in human. We report functional analyses of the two
largest human Ikaros (hIK) isoforms, hIK-VI and hIK-H, in T cells. Abundant
expression of hIK-H, the largest described isoform, is restricted to human
hematopoietic cells. We find that the DNA binding affinity of hIK-H differs from 
that of hIK-VI. Co-expression of hIk-H with hIk-VI alters the ability of Ikaros
complexes to bind DNA motifs found in pericentromeric heterochromatin (PC-HC). In
the nucleus, hIK-VI is localized solely in PC-HC, whereas the hIK-H protein
exhibits dual centromeric and non-centromeric localization. Mutational analysis
defined the amino acids responsible for the distinct DNA binding ability of
hIK-H, as well as the sequence required for the specific subcellular localization
of this isoform. In proliferating cells, the binding of hIK-H to the upstream
regulatory region of known Ikaros target genes correlates with their positive
regulation by Ikaros. Results suggest that expression of hIK-H protein restricts 
affinity of Ikaros protein complexes toward specific PC-HC repeats. We propose a 
model, whereby the binding of hIK-H-deficient Ikaros complexes to the regulatory 
sequence of target genes would recruit these genes to the restrictive
pericentromeric compartment, resulting in their repression. The presence of hIK-H
in the Ikaros complex would alter its affinity for PC-HC, leading to chromatin
remodeling and activation of target genes.

[Mechanism of apoptosis induced by trichostatin A in leukemia Molt-4 cells
analyzed by microarray].

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Histone deacetylase is overexpressed in a variety of
cancers and is closely correlated with oncogenic factors. A histone-deacetylase
inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), has been shown to induce apoptosis in many
cancer cells at submicromolar concentrations. However, the mechanism remains
unknown. This study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of trichostatin A
on apoptosis of Molt-4 cells by characterizing the global gene expression
profiles before and after TSA treatment.
METHODS: PI single-labeled flow cytometry, MTT and DNA ladder were used to
observe the effect of TSA on apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells and normal human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Microarray and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to
detect the differentially expressed genes of Molt-4 cells after incubation with
TSA.
RESULTS: TSA could induce apoptosis in Molt-4 cells in a dose and time-dependent 
manner. Besides, the dose of TSA within the time duration which could induce
significant apoptosis in Molt-4 cells did not demonstrate apparent cytotoxicity
to PBMCs. After incubation with TSA for 9 hours, 313 genes were detected
down-regulated by microarray. Proteins encoded by these genes included signal
transduction molecules, transcription factors, enzymes etc., which were involved 
in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and survival. STAT5A, MYC and
ikaros were down-regulated by 80.4%, 77.3% and 83.1%, respectively. The changes
of the three genes were confirmed by RT-PCR and the changes of STAT5A and MYC
were further confirmed by Western blot.
CONCLUSION: The inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by TSA in
Molt-4 cells may be due to the changes of pro-proliferation genes and
anti-apoptosis genes.

The transcriptional factor Ikaros was originally found to function as a key
regulator of lymphocyte differentiation. In addition, we have reported that
Ikaros regulates the human placental leucine aminopeptidase
(P-LAP)/insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) gene in choriocarcinoma
trophoblastic cells, suggesting that Ikaros might be involved in placental
development, while even its presence in human placenta remains undetermined. We
therefore sought to clarify the location and roles of Ikaros in human placenta.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed modest Ikaris expression in syncytium, and
intense expression in extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) in first trimester
placenta. Western blot analysis showed that villous trophoblasts principally
expressed Ikaros-2/3, while Ikaros-x (Ikx) was predominantly expressed in
cultured EVTs. Furthermore, to investigate the functional role of Ikx in EVTs,
the EVT cell line HTR-8/SVneo was infected with a retrovirus vector expressing
the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged dominant negative isoform Ikaros-6 (Ik6), which
prevents the DNA-binding activity of Ikx. Antibody against HA showed successful
transduction of Ik6 in HTR-8/SVneo cells on immunocytochemistry and Western
blotting. Transduction of Ik6 significantly reduced the migratory and invasive
abilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells. These results suggest that Ikx is involved in
migration and invasion of EVTs in early placentation.

BCR-ABL1 induces aberrant splicing of IKAROS and lineage infidelity in pre-B
lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

Klein F(1), Feldhahn N, Herzog S, Sprangers M, Mooster JL, Jumaa H, Müschen M.

Pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia cells carrying a BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement exhibit
an undifferentiated phenotype. Comparing the genome-wide gene expression profiles
of normal B-cell subsets and BCR-ABL1+ pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia cells by
SAGE, the leukemia cells show loss of B lymphoid identity and aberrant expression
of myeloid lineage-specific molecules. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL1+ pre-B
lymphoblastic leukemia cells exhibit defective expression of IKAROS, a
transcription factor needed for early lymphoid lineage commitment. As shown by
inducible expression of BCR-ABL1 in human and murine B-cell precursor cell lines,
BCR-ABL1 induces the expression of a dominant-negative IKAROS splice variant,
termed IK6. Comparing matched leukemia sample pairs from patients before and
during therapy with the BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor STI571 (Imatinib), inhibition
of BCR-ABL1 partially corrected aberrant expression of IK6 and lineage infidelity
of the leukemia cells. To elucidate the contribution of IK6 to lineage infidelity
in BCR-ABL1+ cell lines, IK6 expression was silenced by RNA interference. Upon
inhibition of IK6, BCR-ABL1+ leukemia cells partially restored B lymphoid lineage
commitment. Therefore, we propose that BCR-ABL1 induces aberrant splicing of
IKAROS, which interferes with lineage identity and differentiation of pre-B
lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

STAT4 is a transcription factor activated in response to IL-12, and is involved
in Th1 cell development. The molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription
of the STAT4 gene are however, unclear. Sequence comparison of the 5' flanking
regions of human, mouse and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) Stat4 genes revealed a
high frequency of Ikaros (Ik) binding elements in all three species. We then
investigated the role of Ik binding elements in the human STAT4 promoter using
Jurkat T cells. Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and RNA
interference-mediated gene knockdown experiments revealed that Ik is involved in 
the regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dynamical mechanisms of pacemaker generation in IK1-downregulated human
ventricular myocytes: insights from bifurcation analyses of a mathematical model.

Dynamical mechanisms of the biological pacemaker (BP) generation in human
ventricular myocytes were investigated by bifurcation analyses of a mathematical 
model. Equilibrium points (EPs), periodic orbits, stability of EPs, and
bifurcation points were determined as functions of bifurcation parameters, such
as the maximum conductance of inward-rectifier K+ current (I(K1)), for
constructing bifurcation diagrams. Stable limit cycles (BP activity) abruptly
appeared around an unstable EP via a saddle-node bifurcation when I(K1) was
suppressed by 84.6%. After the bifurcation at which a stable EP disappears, the
I(K1)-reduced system has an unstable EP only, which is essentially important for 
stable pacemaking. To elucidate how individual sarcolemmal currents contribute to
EP instability and BP generation, we further explored the bifurcation structures 
of the system during changes in L-type Ca2+ channel current (I(Ca,L)),
delayed-rectifier K+ currents (I(K)), or Na(+)/Ca2+ exchanger current (I(NaCa)). 
Our results suggest that 1), I(Ca,L) is, but I(K) or I(NaCa) is not, responsible 
for EP instability as a requisite to stable BP generation; 2), I(K) is
indispensable for robust pacemaking with large amplitude, high upstroke velocity,
and stable frequency; and 3), I(NaCa) is the dominant pacemaker current but is
not necessarily required for the generation of spontaneous oscillations.

Human pregnancy serum and placenta have the ability to degrade uterotonic peptide
oxytocin (OT). Placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP), which is also called
cystine aminopeptidase, is the only membrane aminopeptidase known to functionally
degrade OT as oxytocinase (OTase). P-LAP/OTase hydrolyzes several peptides other 
than OT including vasopressin and angiotensin III. P-LAP/OTase predicted from
cDNA sequence is a type II integral membrane protein, which is converted to a
soluble form existing in maternal serum by metalloproteases, possibly ADAM (a
disintegrin and metalloproteinase) members. P-LAP/OTase activity increases with
normal gestation, while decreases in the patients with preterm delivery and
severe preeclampsia. In placenta, P-LAP/OTase is predominantly expressed in
differentiated trophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts. Activator protein-2 (AP-2) and
Ikaros transcription factors play significant roles in exerting high promoter
activity of P-LAP/OTase in the trophoblastic cells. Moreover, P-LAP/OTase is
transcriptionally regulated in a trophoblast-differentiation-dependent fashion
via up-regulation of AP-2, putatively AP-2alpha. P-LAP/OTase may be involved in
maintaining pregnancy homeostasis via metabolizing peptides such as OT and
vasopressin.

Ikaros transcription factors are essential regulators of lymphopoiesis and the
development of the immune system. We now show that Ikaros is expressed in
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells, where it binds the
proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene expression. Loss of
Ikaros in vivo results in contraction of the pituitary corticomelanotroph
population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels, and adrenal 
glucocorticoid insufficiency. While hemopoietic reconstitution failed to correct 
this hormonal deficit, the phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished
survival was rescued by systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Given the
established immunomodulatory properties of glucocorticoid hormones, these
findings reveal a novel role for Ikaros in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (a major component of the stress system) 
and the immune system contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis at rest and
during stress. Because of their essential roles for the survival of self and
species, the activities of these systems have evolutionarily developed in
parallel and are intertwined at many levels. In this issue of the JCI, Ezzat et
al. demonstrate that Ikaros, a differentiation factor of leukocyte lineage, also 
influences the maturation of the fetal pituitary corticotroph and, hence, the
secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone before and after birth. These results
indicate that Ikaros is an ontogenetic and phylogenetic integrator of the stress 
and immune systems and that abnormalities in its function may produce endocrine
and/or immune pathologies.

(1)Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

Ikaros plays a key role in lymphocyte development and homeostasis by both
potentiating and repressing gene expression. Here we show that Ikaros interacts
with components of the SUMO pathway and is SUMOylated in vivo. Two SUMOylation
sites are identified on Ikaros whose simultaneous modification results in a loss 
of Ikaros' repression function. Ikaros SUMOylation disrupts its participation in 
both histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent and HDAC-independent repression but
does not influence its nuclear localization into pericentromeric heterochromatin.
These studies reveal a new dynamic way by which Ikaros-mediated gene repression
is controlled by SUMOylation.

Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

The chromosomal translocation t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) in human T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia results in the constitutive activation of Notch (Nic).
Reported mutations in Ikaros cause the loss of DNA-binding, which in turn leads
to a loss of repressive activity. Recently, these two mutations have been shown
to cooperate in leukemogenesis. The current model proposes that the combination
of the loss of Ikaros activity and the gain of constitutive Notch activity
disrupts the normal balance between repression and activation at common
regulatory elements. Furthermore, the model is extended to suggest that multiple 
transcription factors coordinate transcriptional repression and activation
through these common regulatory elements. In leukemogenesis, the breakdown of
this coordinate regulation underlies one of the pathophysiological mechanisms.
Finally, using Notch as a template, potential points of interdiction by designer 
therapeutics are discussed.

Neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1) contains an intracellular domain (Nrg-ICD) that translocates
into the nucleus, where it may regulate gene expression upon neuronal
depolarization. However, the identity of its target promoters and the mechanisms 
by which it regulates transcription have been elusive. Here we report that, in
the mouse cochlea, synaptic activity increases the level of nuclear Nrg-ICD and
upregulates postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), a scaffolding protein that 
is enriched in post-synaptic structures. Nrg-ICD enhances the transcriptional
activity of the PSD-95 promoter by binding to a zinc-finger transcription factor,
Eos. The Nrg-ICD-Eos complex induces endogenous PSD-95 expression in vivo through
a signaling pathway that is mostly independent of gamma-secretase regulation.
This upregulation of PSD-95 expression by the Nrg-ICD-Eos complex provides a
molecular basis for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.

Structural studies on a protein-binding zinc-finger domain of Eos reveal both
similarities and differences to classical zinc fingers.

The oligomerization domain that is present at the C terminus of Ikaros-family
proteins and the protein Trps-1 is important for the proper regulation of
developmental processes such as hematopoiesis. Remarkably, this domain is
predicted to contain two classical zinc fingers (ZnFs), domains normally
associated with the recognition of nucleic acids. The preference for protein
binding by these predicted ZnFs is not well-understood. We have used a range of
methods to gain insight into the structure of this domain. Circular dichroism,
UV-vis, and NMR experiments carried out on the C-terminal domain of Eos (EosC)
revealed that the two putative ZnFs (C1 and C2) are separable, i.e., capable of
folding independently in the presence of Zn(II). We next determined the structure
of EosC2 using NMR spectroscopy, revealing that, although the overall fold of
EosC2 is similar to other classical ZnFs, a number of differences exist. For
example, the conformation of the C terminus of EosC2 appears to be flexible and
may result in a major rearrangement of the zinc ligands. Finally,
alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify the residues that are involved 
in the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of Eos, and these results are discussed
in the context of the structure of EosC. These studies provide the first
structural insights into how EosC mediates protein-protein interactions and
contributes to our understanding of why it does not exhibit high-affinity DNA
binding.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a patient with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly and
interstitial deletion of chromosome 7 del(7)(p11.2 p14) involving the GLI3 and
ZNFN1A1 genes.

Houston, Texas, USA.

Greig cephalopolysyndactyly (GCPS; OMIM 175700) is an autosomal dominant
condition caused by mutations of the gene GLI3, located on 7p13. To date, several
cases of deletions and/or translocations involving this locus have been reported 
in patients with GCPS. GLI3 is a transcription factor from the GLI-Kruppel gene
family that has been implicated in three distinct entities: GCPS, Pallister-Hall 
syndrome, and postaxial polydactyly type A. The zinc finger protein, subfamily 1,
member 1 gene (ZNFN1A1; OMIM 603023), on 7p12, codes for a lymphoid-restricted
zinc finger transcription factor, ZNFN1A1, also called IKAROS, that regulates
lymphocyte differentiation and has been associated with the development of
childhood leukemia. We present the case of a 9-year-old Latin-American boy who
was referred for stem cell transplantation because of recurrent acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). On evaluation, he was found to have dysmorphic
features consistent with GCPS, including a prominent forehead, down-slanting
palpebral fissures, 1-2-3 toe syndactyly, broad thumbs and first toes, and mild
developmental delay. He had developed ALL at 5 years of age. Chromosome analysis 
of bone marrow and fibroblastic cells showed an interstitial deletion of
chromosome arm 7p, del(7)(p11.2p14), in 74% and 44% of the cells, respectively.
We performed FISH analysis with a BAC clone containing the ZNFN1A1 gene and
demonstrated that it is contained in the deleted segment. To our knowledge, this 
is the first report of a patient with GCPS and leukemia. We hypothesize that
constitutional deletion of the ZNFN1A1 gene in this patient may have resulted in 
an increased risk of lymphoid malignancy.

Roles of USF, Ikaros and Sp proteins in the transcriptional regulation of the

The hRFC (human reduced folate carrier) is ubiquitously but differentially
expressed in human tissues and its levels are regulated by up to seven non-coding
regions (A1, A2, A, B, C, D and E) and at least four promoters. For the hRFC-B
basal promoter, regulation involves binding of Sp (specificity protein)
transcription factors to a critical GC-box. By transiently transfecting HT1080
cells with 5'- and 3'-deletion constructs spanning 1057 bp of upstream sequence, 
a transcriptionally important region was localized to 158 bp flanking the
transcriptional start sites. By gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays, USF (upstream stimulatory factor), Sp1 and Ikaros-related proteins were
bound to consensus elements (one E-box, two GC-box and three Ikaros) within this 
region. The functional importance of these elements was confirmed by transient
tranfections of HT1080 cells with hRFC-B reporter constructs in which they were
mutated, and by co-transfections of Drosophila Mel-2 cells with wild-type hRFC-B 
promoter and expression constructs for USF1, USF2a, Sp1 and Ikaros 2 and 8. Both 
USF1 and Sp1 proteins transactivated the hRFC-B promoter. Sp1 combined with USF1 
resulted in a synergistic transactivation. Identical results were obtained with
USF2a. Ikaros 2 was a repressor of hRFC-B promoter activity whose effects were
partly reversed by the dominant-negative Ikaros 8. In HT1080 cells, transfection 
with Ikaros 2 decreased endogenous hRFC-B transcripts, whereas USF1 and Sp1
increased transcript levels. Ikaros 2 also decreased reporter gene activity and
levels of acetylated chromatin associated with the endogenous promoter.
Collectively, these results identify transcriptionally important regions in the
hRFC-B promoter that include multiple GC-box, Ikaros and E-box elements. Our
results also suggest that co-operative interactions between transcription factors
Sp1 and USF are essential for high-level hRFC-B transactivation and imply that
these effects are modulated by the family of Ikaros proteins and by histone
acetylation.

Proteins of the Ikaros family control dendritic cell maturation required to
induce optimal Th1 T cell differentiation.

Ikaros proteins are pleiotropic regulators of hematopoiesis and are critically
required for the production of lymphocyte and dendritic cell (DC) lineages in
mice. Here, we asked if Ikaros proteins could also play a role in the late stages
of dendritic cell differentiation. Nuclear Ikaros proteins were up-regulated
during the in vitro differentiation of human monocytes into mature DC, suggesting
potential implications in this process. To address this question, a dominant
negative mutant Ikaros isoform IK7 was over-expressed by retroviral gene transfer
in human DC precursor cells, to interfere with the function of Ikaros family
members during DC development. Expression of IK7 in CD34+ cells inhibited the
production of IL-12-producing APCs. The resulting progeny of CD34+ cells and in
particular, committed CD1a+ DC or CD14+ cell-derived DC, expressed low levels of 
MHC class II antigens and of the CD83 maturation marker on the cell surface. Such
IK7-expressing DC induced naïve allogeneic T cells to produce Th2 cytokines. Our 
results therefore delineate a new role for Ikaros family members, showing that
normal levels of Ikaros proteins are essential in DC to regulate the terminal
stages of maturation and the capacity to induce optimal Th1 T cell responses.

Phosphorylation controls Ikaros's ability to negatively regulate the G(1)-S
transition.

Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.

Ikaros is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferative responses. Inactivating
mutations in Ikaros cause antigen-mediated lymphocyte hyperproliferation and the 
rapid development of leukemia and lymphoma. Here we show that Ikaros's ability to
negatively regulate the G(1)-S transition can be modulated by phosphorylation of 
a serine/threonine-rich conserved region (p1) in exon 8. Ikaros phosphorylation
in p1 is induced during the G(1)-S transition. Mutations that prevent
phosphorylation in p1 increase Ikaros's ability to impede cell cycle progression 
and its affinity for DNA. Casein kinase II, whose increased activity in
lymphocytes leads to transformation, is a key player in Ikaros p1
phosphorylation. We thus propose that Ikaros's activity as a regulator of the
G(1)-S transition is controlled by phosphorylation in response to signaling
events that down-modulate its DNA binding activity.

Overexpression of the Ikaros 6 isoform is restricted to t(4;11) acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia in children and infants and has a role in B-cell
survival.

The Ikaros transcription factor has been shown to play an important role in the
differentiation of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Mice heterozygous for a
dominant negative (DN) ikaros isoform develop T-cell leukaemia and lymphoma with 
100% penetrance. Overexpression of DN Ikaros isoforms has been reported in some
forms of leukaemia, such as childhood acute myelomonocytic and monocytic
leukaemias, adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (B ALL) and in childhood 
and adult pre-B ALL. In this study, the expression of Ikaros isoforms in 49
infant and childhood leukaemia patients was analysed by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. We found overexpression of
the DN Ikaros 6 (Ik6) isoform in a subset of leukaemia patients harbouring
t(4;11) translocations. To further study the consequences of Ik6 overexpression
in B ALL, we inducibly expressed Ik6 in BaF3 cells and found that Ik6
overexpression delayed cell death after interleukin-3 withdrawal, suggesting that
overexpression of Ik6 found in t(4;11) B cells could contribute to
leukaemogenesis by preventing the apoptosis of cells in an environment with
reduced survival factors.

Ikaros family members from the agnathan Myxine glutinosa and the urochordate

The Ikaros multigene family encodes a number of zinc finger transcription factors
that play key roles in vertebrate hemopoietic stem cell differentiation and the
generation of B, T, and NK cell lineages. In this study, we describe the
identification and characterization of an Ikaros family-like (IFL) protein from
the agnathan hagfish Myxine glutinosa and the marine urochordate Oikopleura
dioica, both of which lie on the evolutionary boundary between the vertebrates
and invertebrates. The IFL molecules identified in these animals displayed high
conservation in the zinc finger motifs critical for DNA binding and dimerization 
in comparison with those of jawed vertebrates. Expression of the IFL gene in
hagfish was strongest in blood, intestine, and gills. In O. dioica, transcription
from the IFL gene was initiated at or around the time of hatching and maintained 
throughout the life span of the animal. In situ hybridization localized O. dioica
IFL expression to the Fol cells, which are responsible for generating the food
filter of the house. Biochemical analysis of the DNA binding and dimerization
domains from M. glutinosa and O. dioici IFLs showed that M. glutinosa behaves as 
a true Ikaros family member. Taken together, these results indicate that the
properties associated with the Ikaros family preceded the emergence of the jawed 
vertebrates and thus adaptive immunity.

Targeted expression of a human pituitary tumor derived-fibroblast growth factor
receptor-4 (FGFR4) recapitulates pituitary tumorigenesis. We have shown that
FGFR4 is a target for Ikaros, a zinc finger-containing transcription factor that 
localizes to heterochromatin regions and participates in higher order chromatin
complexes and control of gene expression. We report here the expression of Ikaros
and functional differences between its alternatively spliced variants in human
pituitary tumors. Ik1 expression was detected in human pituitary tumors and we
also identified a truncated isoform consistent with the non-DNA-binding Ik6
isoform in a subset of adenomas by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction, sequencing, and Western immunoblotting. Transfection of Ik6 in GH4
pituitary cells resulted in predominantly cytoplasmic expression as compared to
Ik1, which resulted in exclusively nuclear expression as determined by
immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of fractionated protein.
Immunohistochemistry of primary human pituitary adenomas localized Ikaros
expression to the nuclear compartment but also in the cytoplasm, the latter
consistent with Ik6. Expression of Ikaros and truncated non-DNA-binding isoforms 
was also suggested by electromobility shift assays using nuclear proteins from
primary human pituitary adenomas. Ik6 resulted in reversal of the effects of Ik1 
on wild-type 5' FGFR4 promoter activity, histone acetylation, and regulation of
the endogenous gene. We conclude that dominant-negative Ik6 isoforms with their
distinct localization and effects on Ik1 action may contribute to the altered
expression of FGFR4 and possibly other target genes in human pituitary tumors.

Perturbation of Ikaros isoform selection by MLV integration is a cooperative

The chromosomal translocation t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) in human T cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) results in the aberrant expression of the
intracellular domain of Notch (N(ic)). Consistent with the current multistep
model for tumorigenesis, mice that express N(ic) in T cell progenitors develop a 
T-ALL-like disease with a lengthened latency. Proviral insertional mutagenesis
greatly accelerated the onset of leukemia in N(ic) transgenic mice. We
demonstrate that the Ikaros (Ik) locus is a common target of proviral integration
in N(ic) transgenic mice, which results in the loss of Ik DNA binding activity
through altered isoform expression. We propose that cooperative leukemogenesis
occurs in cells that have constitutive N(ic) and altered Ik isoform expression
because genes normally repressed by Ik become activated by N(ic)/CSL.

Progesterone activates fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) promoter in human T
lymphocytes through the transcription factor Ikaros. Evidence for a synergistic
effect of leptin.

Physiological concentrations of progesterone stimulate the activity of the
endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in human T
lymphocytes, up to a approximately 270% over the untreated controls. Stimulation 
of FAAH occurred through up-regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and 
translational level and was specific. Indeed, neither the activity of the
anandamide-synthesizing N-acyltransferase and phospholipase D, nor the activity
of the anandamide transporter, nor the binding to cannabinoid receptors were
affected by progesterone under the same experimental conditions. The activation
of FAAH by progesterone was paralleled by a decrease (down to 60%) of the
cellular levels of anandamide and involved increased nuclear levels of the
transcription factor Ikaros. Analysis of the FAAH promoter showed an Ikaros
binding site, and mutation of this site prevented FAAH activation by progesterone
in transient expression assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift
assays further corroborated the promoter activity data. Furthermore, the effect
of progesterone on FAAH promoter was additive to that of physiological amounts of
leptin, which binds to a cAMP response element-like site in the promoter region. 
Taken together, these results suggest that progesterone and leptin, by
up-regulating the FAAH promoter at different sites, enhance FAAH expression, thus
tuning the immunomodulatory effects of anandamide. These findings might also have
critical implications for human fertility.

The TRPS1 gene codes for a 1281 amino acids nuclear transcription factor with an 
unusual combination of different types of zinc finger motifs, including GATA-type
DNA-binding and IKAROS-like zinc fingers. TRPS1 is a repressor of GATA-regulated 
genes and implicated in the human tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndromes. We found
that two distinct regions of TRPS1 can physically interact with the dynein light 
chain 8 protein, LC8a, that are at least 458 amino acids apart from each other.
Region A covers 89 amino acids (635-723), spanning three potential C(2)H(2) zinc 
finger structures, and region B covers the 100 most C-terminal amino acids
(1182-1281) containing the IKAROS-like motif. LC8a is known to interact with more
than 10 different molecules, both proteins and nucleic acids. In most cases, LC8a
was identified as a transport molecule in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, we found 
that LC8a co-localizes with TRPS1 in dot-like structures in the cell nucleus. In 
an electrophoretic mobility shift assay we could show that the interaction of
LC8a and TRPS1 lowers the binding of TRPS1 to the GATA consensus sequence. In
addition, GATA-regulated reporter gene assay indicated that LC8a is able to
suppress the transcriptional repression activity of TRPS1.

Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios: transcription regulators and lymphoid malignancies.

Rebollo A(1), Schmitt C.

Author information:

Bd de l'Hôpital, Paris, France.

Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios encode zinc finger transcription factors that are
important regulators of lymphoid development and differentiation. These proteins 
are involved in the control of gene expression and when associated with nuclear
complexes, participate in nucleosome remodeling. Because differential splicing
produces multiple protein isoforms with potentially different functions, the
Ikaros protein family provides a useful model for the study of whether
post-transcriptional modifications are involved in tumoral transformation.
Several reports reinforce the hypothesis that Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios
expression is deregulated in human leukaemias. The direct involvement of aberrant
protein expression of Ikaros family members in human haematological malignancies 
is discussed.

Overexpression of dominant-negative Ikaros 6 protein is restricted to a subset of

antigen.

Ikaros is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis. Its effects result in part from 
the balance between the isoforms that are produced by differential splicing of
the pre-mRNA. Short isoforms that lack the DNA-binding domain act as dominant
negatives by binding long isoforms through the C-terminal zinc-finger domain,
which allows for the homo- or heterodimerization of the proteins. There are a
number of evidences that different subsets of murine hematopoietic progenitors - 
as defined by phenotype - have different patterns of Ikaros expression. Forced
expression of short isoforms (Ik5, Ik6 or Ik7) in murine or human hematopoietic
progenitors alters the differentiation capacities of these cells. Human leukemias
provide additional information: because of the blockade in differentiation,
leukemias represent an equivalent of a particular stage of human hematopoietic
hierarchy. We and others have shown that human acute leukemias are heterogeneous 
for the pattern of Ikaros isoform expression. The present study focused on adult 
de novo B ALLs and the Ikaros 6 isoform. ProB (BI, n=3), common B (BII, n=15) and
preB (BIII, n=3) ALL were identified by their phenotype. RT-PCR and Western blot 
analyses of blast cell protein lysates suggest that approximately 50% of BII
leukemias overexpress Ikaros 6 RNA and protein. Comparison of BII cells with high
or normal levels of Ik6 shows a higher level of expression for the membrane stem 
cell antigen CD34 in the former, as detected with flow cytometry and confirmed
with DNA arrays.

In previous studies, we demonstrated an over-expression of the dominant-negative 
isoform of the transcription factor Ikaros, Ik-6, in patients with B-cell
malignancies, including blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia and acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia. To investigate the consequence of over-expression of
Ik-6 in B cells, we constructed Ik-6 transfectants of the FDH-1 and Ramos cell
lines. FDH-1, which was established from a patient with early pre-B acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia, undergoes apoptosis with dexamethasone treatment,
whereas Ramos undergoes apoptosis following anti-IgM antibody treatment. Compared
with the wild type, the over-expression of Ik-6 rendered the FDH-1 and Ramos
transfectants resistant to dexamethasone-induced and anti-IgM-induced apoptosis
respectively. An immunoblotting study demonstrated bcl-2 upregulation in
anti-IgM-induced Ramos Ik-6 transfectants, but not in FDH-1 Ik-6 transfectants.
Further investigations of the mechanism of leukaemogenesis associated with the
over-expression of Ik-6 are warranted.

The Ikaros gene is alternately spliced to generate multiple DNA-binding and
nonbinding isoforms that have been implicated as regulators of hematopoiesis,
particularly in the lymphoid lineages. Although early reports of Ikaros mutant
mice focused on lymphoid defects, these mice also show significant myeloid,
erythroid, and stem cell defects. However, the specific Ikaros proteins expressed
in these cells have not been determined. We recently described Ikaros-x (Ikx), a 
new Ikaros isoform that is the predominant Ikaros protein in normal human
hematopoietic cells. In this study, we report that the Ikx protein is selectively
expressed in human myeloid lineage cells, while Ik1 predominates in the lymphoid 
and erythroid lineages. Both Ik1 and Ikx proteins are expressed in early human
hematopoietic cells (Lin(-)CD34(+)). Under culture conditions that promote
specific lineage differentiation, Ikx is up-regulated during myeloid
differentiation but down-regulated during lymphoid differentiation from human
Lin(-)CD34(+) cells. We show that Ikx and other novel Ikaros splice variants
identified in human studies are also expressed in murine bone marrow. In mice, as
in humans, the Ikx protein is selectively expressed in the myeloid lineage. Our
studies suggest that Ikaros proteins function in myeloid, as well as lymphoid,
differentiation and that specific Ikaros isoforms may play a role in regulating
lineage commitment decisions in mice and humans.

Selective dimerization of a C2H2 zinc finger subfamily.

McCarty AS(1), Kleiger G, Eisenberg D, Smale ST.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Molecular Biology Institute, University of
California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

The C2H2 zinc finger is the most prevalent protein motif in the mammalian
proteome. Two C2H2 fingers in Ikaros are dedicated to homotypic interactions
between family members. We show here that these fingers comprise a bona fide
dimerization domain. Dimerization is highly selective, however, as homologous
domains from the TRPS-1 and Drosophila Hunchback proteins support
homodimerization, but not heterodimerization with Ikaros. Ikaros-Hunchback
selectivity is determined by 11 residues concentrated within the alpha-helical
regions typically involved in base recognition. Preferential homodimerization of 
one chimeric protein predicts a parallel dimer interface and establishes the
feasibility of creating novel dimer specificities. These results demonstrate that
the C2H2 motif provides a versatile platform for both sequence-specific
protein-nucleic acid interactions and highly specific dimerization.

Ikaros family members are important regulatory factors in lymphocyte development.
Here we show that Ikaros may play an important role in CD4 versus CD8 lineage
commitment decisions by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements
in the endogenous CD8alpha locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations, (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect variegation of
transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements, and (3) that mice with reduced
levels of Ikaros and Aiolos show an apparent increase in CD4 populations with
immature phenotype, i.e., cells that failed to activate the CD8alpha gene locus. 
We propose that Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8alpha gene
locus and that their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage commitment.

Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) in adult mice have been classified into distinct
subsets based on keratin expression profiles. To explore the emergence of TEC
subsets during ontogeny, we analyzed keratin 8 and keratin 5 expression at
several stages of fetal development in normal C57BL/6J mice. In addition, thymic 
epithelial development and compartmentalization were explored in
recombination-activating gene 2/common cytokine receptor gamma-chain-deficient
and Ikaros-null mice that sustain early and profound blocks in thymocyte
differentiation. The results demonstrate that initial patterning of the thymic
epithelial compartment as defined by differential keratin expression does not
depend on inductive signals from hematopoietic cells. However, thymocyte-derived 
signals are required during late fetal stages for continued development and
maintenance of TEC subsets in the neonate and adult.

Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor, is essential for lymphoid
development. Mutant mice expressing dominant-negative Ikaros gene (Ikaros)
isoforms develop an aggressive form of lymphoid malignancies. We examined the
expression of Ikaros isoforms in 11 leukemic cell lines and adult acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cells from 36 patients with B-precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) and nine with T-precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (pre-T ALL), using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) analysis. In one pre-B ALL cell line, INC cells, and primary leukemic
cells from 16 patients with pre-B ALL, we found the predominant expression of a
non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoform, Ik-6. However, Ik-6 was not detected in pre-T ALL
cells. All of pre-B ALL cells expressing Ik-6 were CD10(+), whereas CD10(-) pre-B
ALL cells did not express Ik-6. The expression of Ik-6 was not related to
karyotype abnormalities such as t(9;22) and t(4;11). Proteins from the cells that
expressed Ik-6 alone failed to bind to the Ikaros protein-specific binding
sequence in DNA. Ikaros proteins lacking the DNA binding sequences were detected 
in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus of the cells. When INC and primary pre-B 
ALL cells that express Ik-6 alone were irradiated and cultured in the absence of 
serum, these cells produced functional Ikaros isoforms, Ik-1 and Ik-2. Purified
CD19(+) CD10(-) and CD19(+) CD10(+) cells from normal human bone marrow did not
express Ik-6. The predominant expression of Ik-6, which is the result of
post-transcription dysregulation, is characteristic of adult pre-B ALL,
especially CD10(+) pre-B ALL.

The Ikaros (Ik) gene family, which includes Ik, Aiolos (Ai), and Helios (He), is 
a primary regulator of lymphocyte differentiation, and is involved in the
development of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We analysed the expression of
the Ik gene family isoforms in 97 ALL cases, consisting of 64 childhood and 33
infant ALL cases, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Expression of Ik was detected in all cases, 87 of which expressed either Ik1 or
Ik2, or both, five of which expressed Ik1/Ik2 and Ik6, and another five of which 
expressed only Ik6. Therefore, the dominant negative isoform of Ik6 was expressed
in 10 of the 38 cases of childhood precursor B ALL, but was absent in other types
of childhood ALL (26.3%, chi2-test, P = 0.0001). In terms of Aiolos and Helios
expression, 49 (65.3%) out of the 75 and 40 (50%) out of the 80 ALL cases tested 
showed non-spliced Ai1 and He1 respectively. Only one case of T lineage ALL
expressed a small-sized isoform of Helios (designated as He6). It was also found 
that the expression of Ai1 and He1 was low in Ik6-positive patients (Fisher's
exact test; Ai1 P = 0.005, Hel P = 0.035).

A molecular dissection of the repression circuitry of Ikaros.

Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.

Ikaros is a key regulator of the hemo-lymphoid system in which it is presumed to 
function by both potentiating and repressing gene expression. Repression is
mediated through two independent domains at the N and C terminus of the protein, 
both of which can independently recruit the corepressors Mi-2beta, Sin3A, and
Sin3B and the Class I histone deacetylases 1 and 2; the N-terminal domain can
also associate with the corepressor CtBP. Here we describe a detailed dissection 
of these two domains and identify the minimal repression modules and the
corepressor requirements for their activity. Based on these studies, we describe 
mutations in a full-length Ikaros protein that abrogate interactions with each of
the identified corepressors and abolish the protein's function as a repressor.
Finally, we show that, barring CtBP, the Ikaros family members Aiolos, Helios,
and Eos can associate with all of the identified corepressors of Ikaros including
its newly identified interactors, Class II HDACs.

Aiolos and Ikaros: regulators of lymphocyte development, homeostasis and
lymphoproliferation.

Aiolos and Ikaros encode hemopoietic-specific zinc finger transcription factors
that are important regulators of lymphocyte differentiation. Aiolos and Ikaros
play a critical role in regulating B and T cell development. Gene targeting
studies in mice have shown that inactivation of Ikaros family proteins leads to a
complete absence of T, B, NK and dendritic cells, whereas a reduction of Ikaros
activity induce hyperproliferation and lymphomas. Aiolos knock-out mice have
quantitatively normal lymphoid cells but have chronically activated B cells
producing autoantibodies and develop lymphomas with increased frequency. These
proteins are involved in the control of gene expression and, associated to
nuclear complexes, participate in nucleosome remodeling. This protein family
governs cell fate decisions and regulates homeostasis through complex isoforms
expression and dimerization. Changes in this regulatory network may reflect
differentiation and proliferation adjustments made in lymphoid progenitors and
precursors. The direct involvement of aberrant Ikaros protein expression in human
hematological oncogenesis, although suggested by several studies, remains to be
settled at the genomic level. These points will be discussed in the present
review.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 is a target for the zinc-finger transcription
factor Ikaros in the pituitary.

Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) have been implicated in a multitude of
endocrine cell hormonal and proliferative properties, and FGFR4 is differentially
expressed in normal and neoplastic pituitary. We therefore examined the
functionally important cis-DNA elements and multiprotein complexes implicated in 
the cooperative control of expression of the human FGFR4 gene in pituitary cells.
Using deletional mapping, we defined a 214-bp (-115/+99) promoter that was
functional in pituitary GH4 and PRL 235 cells. Overlapping 40- to 50-bp fragments
of this minimal promoter were examined by EMSA. Interestingly, fragment C
(-64/-26) included potential binding sites for the hematopoietic zinc
finger-containing transcription factor Ikaros (Ik) flanked by binding sites for
Sp and Ets-type factors. DNA binding by Ik, Sp, and Ets-like factors was
confirmed by oligonucleotide competition and supershifting with specific
antibodies. Transcriptional regulation of FGFR4 by Ik was demonstrated by
cotransfection of Ik1 with or without Sp1 or Ets overexpression and by disruption
of the Ik binding site. Although both Ets-1 and Sp1 overexpression stimulated
promoter activity, mutation of the Ik-binding site completely eliminated the Ik1 
effect. Specific Ik expression was identified by Western blotting of pituitary
GH4 and PRL235 cells and localized in primary mouse hormone-producing anterior
pituitary cells by immunocytochemistry. Our findings point to a new role for Ik
outside the hematopoietic system and suggest a novel transcriptional contribution
with Ets and Sp1 in regulation of FGFR4 in the pituitary.

OBJECTIVE: In previous studies, we demonstrated overexpression of the
dominant-negative isoform of the transcription factor Ikaros, Ik-6, in patients
with blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia. In the present study, we analyzed expression of the Ikaros family genes
Ikaros, Aiolos, and Helios in a panel of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell
lines and bone marrow samples of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction, sequencing analysis, immunoblotting, and Southern blotting.
RESULTS: We found overexpression of novel short isoforms of Helios (Hel-5 and
Hel-6) in the HD-Mar cell line. Southern blot analysis suggested that there might
be a small deletion in the Helios locus of HD-Mar. In addition, we observed
decreased expression of more than one Ikaros family gene in 3 of 9 patients with 
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Moreover, one of the patients overexpressed 
novel short isoforms of Helios (Hel-7 and Hel-8).
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of an Ikaros family member
(other than Ikaros) of which novel short isoforms become overexpressed in human
leukemia.

The regulated production of several terminally differentiated cell types of the
blood and immune systems (haematopoiesis) has been the focus of many studies on
cell-fate determination. Chromatin and the control of its structure have been
implicated in the regulation of cell-fate decisions and in the maintenance of the
determined states. Here, I review advances in the field, emphasizing the
potential role of chromatin in lineage commitment and differentiation. In this
context, I discuss Ikaros, an essential regulator of lymphocyte development and
an integral component of a functionally diverse chromatin remodelling network
that operates from the early stages of haematopoiesis to the mature lymphocytes.

The Ikaros (Ik) protein, or LyF1, was initially described as a protein binding to
regulatory sequences of a number of genes expressed in murine lymphoid cells.
Ikaros is a critical regulator of normal hematopoietic stem cell differentiation,
as evidenced by dramatic defects in the lymphoid compartments, in homozygous
animals with gene inactivation. Because differential splicing produces multiple
isoforms with potentially different functions, Ikaros provides a unique model to 
study how post-transcriptional mechanisms may be involved in neoplastic
processes. Indeed, several groups including ours have underlined evidences that
expression of different Ikaros isoforms vary among different types of leukemias. 
The predominance of short isoforms in certain subsets is intriguing. Here,
additional observations reinforced the hypothesis that Ikaros expression may be
deregulated in human leukemias. Whether this is a cause or a consequence of the
leukemic process remains speculative. Other human diseases however, provide
examples of abnormal post-transcriptional regulations that have been further
characterized.

While studying Ikaros proteins in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Ikaros 
isoform 6 (Ik6) expression was detected in 7 of 10 cases of M4 and M5 leukemia,
but in none of the remaining French-American-British subtypes (M2, 8 cases; M7, 6
cases). The spliced Ikaros isoforms 4 to 8 (Ik4-8) suppress the function of
full-length Ik1 or Ik2 in a dominant-negative manner, owing to their reduced
numbers of DNA binding sites. Thus, dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms may inhibit
the normal transcriptional regulation of hematopoietic cell development. To
clarify the function of Ik6 in developing blood cells, this isoform was
transiently transfected into an Ik2(+), interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D murine
myeloid precursor cell line and studied the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins
in relation to in vitro cell growth, using a tetracycline-inducible TREx system. 
The possibility of aberrant cell regulation due to Ikaros functional changes was 
examined by cotransfecting both Ik2 and Ik6 into Ikaros/Aiolos/Helios
triple-negative Cos-7 cells. The results demonstrated IL-3-independent growth by 
Ik6-transfected 32D clones coincident with up-regulation of the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl-XL. Up-regulation of Bcl-XL, but not of other Bcl-2 family proteins, 
was associated with the suppression of functional Ik2 by Ik6 in a
dominant-negative fashion. Thus, the pathogenesis of myelomonocytic/monocytic AML
may involve aberrant regulation of apoptosis due to unscheduled expression of the
Ik6 isoform.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor-1 (VPAC-1) is a novel gene target of the
hemolymphopoietic transcription factor Ikaros.

Francisco, California 94143-0711, USA. Glenn-Dorsam@excite.com

Vasoactive intestinal peptide and its G-protein-coupled receptors, VPAC-1 and
VPAC-2, are highly expressed in the immune system and modulate diverse T cell
functions. The human VPAC-1 5'-flanking region (1.4 kb) contains four high
affinity Ikaros (IK) consensus sequences. Ikaros native protein from T cell
nuclear extracts and IK-1 and IK-2 recombinant proteins recognized an IK high
affinity binding motif in the VPAC-1 promoter in electrophoretic mobility shift
assays by a sequence-specific mechanism, and anti-IK antibodies supershifted this
complex. Stable NIH-3T3 clones overexpressing IK-1 or IK-2 isoforms were
generated to investigate Ikaros regulation of endogenous VPAC-1 expression as
assessed by quantifying VPAC-1 mRNA and protein. By traditional and
fluorometric-based kinetic reverse transcription-PCR and (125)I-labeled
vasoactive intestinal peptide binding, both IK-1 and IK-2 suppressed endogenous
VPAC-1 expression in NIH-3T3 clones by a range of 50-93%. When a series of nested
deletions of the VPAC-1 luciferase reporter construct were transiently
transfected into IK-2 clones there was up to a 41% decrease in transcriptional
activity compared with vector control. Two major IK-2 binding domains also were
identified at -1076 to -623 bp and at -222 to -35 bp, respectively. As both
Ikaros and its novel target VPAC-1 are highly expressed in T cells, this system
may be a dominant determinant of the VPAC-1 expression in immune responses.

Multiple hematopoietic defects and delayed globin switching in Ikaros null mice.

We have previously reported the structure of a chromatin remodeling complex (PYR 
complex) with Ikaros as its DNA binding subunit that is specifically present in
adult murine and human hematopoietic cells. We now show that homozygous Ikaros
"knockout" (null) mice lack the PYR complex, demonstrating the requirement for
Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA. Heterozygous Ikaros null mice have
about half as much PYR complex, indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and
PYR complex. We also show that Ikaros null mice have multiple hematopoietic cell 
defects including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
previously reported lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also have a
delay in murine embryonic to adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma to beta switching, consistent with a previously suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicate that several
hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages are either up- or
down-regulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros null as compared with wild-type
mice. These results indicate that Ikaros and PYR complex function together in
vivo at many adult hematopoietic cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites,
affecting their expression and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Unconventional potentiation of gene expression by Ikaros.

Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

Ikaros is essential for the normal development and regulated proliferation of
lymphoid cells. In lymphocytes, Ikaros exists as an integral component of
chromatin-remodeling complexes, including the Mi-2beta/nucleosome remodeling and 
deacetylation complex (NuRD) complex. It is expected that Ikaros, together with
these associated activities effects repression, but here we show that they may
also potentiate gene expression in cycling cells. Ikaros cannot activate
transcription by itself; instead, it enhances the activity of both weak and
strong activators. For this role in potentiation, Ikaros requires its DNA binding
and dimerization domains. The DNA binding and dimerization properties of Ikaros
are also responsible for its targeting to pericentromeric heterochromatin
(PC-HC). Significantly, Ikaros mutants with altered specificity for DNA binding
that are unable to localize to PC-HC are incapable of stimulating transcription
from reporters bearing their cognate sites. Thus, potentiation of gene expression
by Ikaros correlates strongly with its ability to localize to PC-HC in
combination with the chromatin remodeler Mi-2beta.

P-LAP is identical with cystine aminopeptidase as oxytocinase. We previously
located on the placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP) gene the footprint site
with the high promoter activity (FP3: -214 to -183) and found a possible
interaction between it and AP-2 in choriocarcinoma cells. Here, we investigated
FP3 in detail and identified the elements responsible for the high basal rate of 
transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that FP3 would 
interact with Ikaros as well as AP-2. Further analysis using antibody against
Ikaros confirmed that Ikaros was indeed present and bound to FP3. In addition,
AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma antibodies supershifted the second complex at FP3.
Functionally, mutations that eliminate AP-2 binding reduced promoter activity
significantly, while those that eliminate Ikaros binding reduced promoter
activity insignificantly. Double mutations of AP-2 and Ikaros decreased promoter 
activity progressively. We conclude that AP-2 is the main activator and Ikaros
functions cooperatively with it for maximal expression of the human P-LAP gene.

Aiolos is a chromatin remodeling transcription regulator that plays an
antiproliferative role in B lymphocyte function. In contrast to the related
Ikaros factors, mammalian Aiolos has not been reported to generate splice
variants. In addition, although human leukemic lymphoblasts express
non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms with potential dominant negative effect on other 
interacting factors,the role of Aiolos in human lymphoid disorders has remained
obscure. To address the question, why Aiolos should delineate from Ikaros in such
a marked way, we have here analyzed whether also human Aiolos could generate
alternate isoforms. According to the results obtained, both normal and neoplastic
B lineage cells were found to express at least five novel Aiolos variants. Also
structurally dominant negative variants with less than three DNA-binding domains 
were identified. In conclusion, given the multiplicity of also human Aiolos
isoforms and thereby the evidently more intricate contribution of Aiolos to the
chromatin remodeling machinery, it is suggested, that not only Ikaros, but also
Aiolos could participate in a more versatile manner in the regulation of B
lymphocyte function.

Ikaros, a lymphoid-cell-specific transcription factor, contributes to the

Mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses induce T-cell lymphomas in AKR/J strain
mice. MCF 247, the prototype of this group of nonacute murine leukemia viruses,
transforms thymocytes, in part, by insertional mutagenesis and enhancer-mediated 
dysregulation of cellular proto-oncogenes. The unique 3' (U3) regions in the long
terminal repeats of other murine leukemia viruses contain transcription factor
binding sites known to be important for enhancer function and for the induction
of T-cell lymphomas. Although transcription factor binding sites important for
the biological properties of MCF 247 have not been identified, pathogenesis
studies from our laboratory suggested to us that binding sites for Ikaros, a
lymphoid-cell-restricted transcriptional regulator, affect the biological
properties of MCF 247. In this report, we demonstrate that Ikaros binds to
predicted sites in U3 sequences of MCF 247 and that site-directed mutations in
these sites greatly diminish this binding in vitro. Consistent with these
findings, ectopic expression of Ikaros in murine cells that do not normally
express this protein significantly increases transcription from the viral
promoter in transient gene expression assays. Moreover, site-directed mutations
in specific Ikaros-binding sites reduce this activity in T-cell lines that
express Ikaros endogenously. To determine whether the Ikaros-binding sites are
functional in vivo, we inoculated newborn mice with a variant MCF virus
containing a mutant Ikaros-binding site. The variant virus replicated in
thymocytes less efficiently and induced lymphomas with a delayed onset compared
to the wild-type virus. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the
Ikaros-binding sites in the U3 region of MCF 247 are functional and cooperate
with other DNA elements for optimal enhancer function in vivo.

Studies in mice suggest that the Ikaros (Ik) gene encodes several isoforms and is
a critical regulator of hematolymphoid differentiation. Little is known on the
role of Ikaros in human stem cell differentiation. Herein, the biological
consequences of the forced expression of Ikaros 6 (Ik6) in human placental blood 
CD34(+) progenitors are evaluated. Ik6 is one of the isoforms produced from the
Ikaros premessenger RNA by alternative splicing and is thought to behave as a
dominant negative isoform of the gene product because it lacks the DNA binding
domain present in transcriptionally active isoforms. The results demonstrate that
human cord blood CD34(+) cells that express high levels of Ik6 as a result of
retrovirally mediated gene transfer have a reduced capacity to produce lymphoid B
cells in 2 independent assays: (1) in vitro reinitiation of human hematopoiesis
during coculture with the MS-5 murine stromal cell line and (2)
xenotransplantation in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice.
These results suggest that Ikaros plays an important role in stem cell commitment
in humans and that the balance between the different isoforms is a key element of
this regulatory system; they support the hypothesis that posttranscriptional
events can participate in the control of human hematopoietic differentiation.

Murine studies implicate Ikaros proteins as regulators of hemopoiesis,
particularly in the lymphoid lineages. High homology between murine and human
Ikaros suggests that Ikaros expression in the two might be similar. However,
initial human studies that focused on leukemia detected novel Ikaros transcripts 
in patient samples. Thus, novel Ikaros splice forms and DNA nonbinding isoforms
were linked with malignancy. We undertook an extensive analysis of normal human
Ikaros expression to determine whether novel mRNAs are expressed as proteins and 
the extent to which these splice variants are unique to leukemia. Here we show
that both mRNA and protein for DNA nonbinding Ikaros isoforms and splice variants
previously linked to leukemia are expressed in normal human cells. However, our
studies identify a new Ikaros isoform not previously described in mouse or human.
This isoform is the predominant Ikaros protein in normal human cells, but not in 
leukemia cell lines.

Binding of Ikaros to the lambda5 promoter silences transcription through a

The Ikaros family of proteins are DNA binding factors required for correct
development of B and T lymphocytes. Cytogenetic studies have shown that these
proteins form complexes with pericentromeric heterochromatin in B cells, and the 
colocalization of transcriptionally silent genes with these complexes suggests
that Ikaros could silence transcription by recruiting genes to heterochromatin.
Here we show that a site in the lambda5 promoter that binds Ikaros and Aiolos is 
required for silencing of lambda5 expression in activated mature B cells.
Analysis of methylation and nuclease accessibility indicates that the silenced
lambda5 gene is not heterochromatinized in B cells, despite being associated with
pericentromeric heterochromatin clusters. We also found that a promoter mutation,
which affects Ikaros-mediated silencing of lambda5 expression, is not rescued in 
a transgenic line that has the gene integrated into pericentromeric
heterochromatin. Our results indicate that the Ikaros proteins initiate silencing
of lambda5 expression through a direct effect on the promoter with localization
to pericentromeric heterochromatin likely to affect the action of Ikaros on
regulatory sequences rather than causing heterochromatinization of the gene.

Ikaros family members play critical roles in hematopoietic development, yet
molecules regulated by Ikaros proteins remain incompletely characterized. To
determine the requirements for functional Ikaros proteins, we overexpressed Ik7, 
a dominant negative Ikaros protein, in human cell lines and hematopoietic
progenitor cells. Ik7 is known to block the normal function of other Ikaros
family members in human and mouse cells. Retroviral-mediated overexpression of
Ik7 affected two distinct, migratory properties of the CEM T-cell line. Ik7
down-regulated L-selectin cell-surface expression, an effect not a result of
increased shedding but of a decrease in L-selectin mRNA levels. Ik7 also reduced 
the spontaneous migration of CEM T cells in 3-D collagen gels. A reduction in
L-selectin, cell-surface expression was also induced by Ik7 in CD34+
hematopoietic progenitor cells. In contrast, the Reh B cell line showed an
up-regulation of L-selectin, cell-surface levels when expressing Ik7. For the
first time, this study defines an effect of Ikaros proteins in the control of
migration-related properties and shows that intact Ikaros proteins are important 
in a cell type-specific manner for the normal regulation of L-selectin
expression.

Known vertebrate GATA proteins contain two zinc fingers and are required in
development, whereas invertebrates express a class of essential proteins
containing one GATA-type zinc finger. We isolated the gene encoding TRPS1, a
vertebrate protein with a single GATA-type zinc finger. TRPS1 is highly conserved
between Xenopus and mammals, and the human gene is implicated in dominantly
inherited tricho-rhino-phalangeal (TRP) syndromes. TRPS1 is a nuclear protein
that binds GATA sequences but fails to transactivate a GATA-dependent reporter.
Instead, TRPS1 potently and specifically represses transcriptional activation
mediated by other GATA factors. Repression does not occur from competition for
DNA binding and depends on a C-terminal region related to repressive domains
found in Ikaros proteins. During mouse development, TRPS1 expression is prominent
in sites showing pathology in TRP syndromes, which are thought to result from
TRPS1 haploinsufficiency. We show instead that truncating mutations identified in
patients encode dominant inhibitors of wild-type TRPS1 function, suggesting an
alternative mechanism for the disease. TRPS1 is the first example of a GATA
protein with intrinsic transcriptional repression activity and possibly a
negative regulator of GATA-dependent processes in vertebrate development.

The BCL6 gene, isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated chromosomal
translocations, has been implicated in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBL).
Here we describe the molecular characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12)
translocations in 2 patients with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the
breakpoint area involving BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene, a
central regulator of lymphoid differentiation that had been mapped to human
chromosome 7 band p13-p11.1. As a molecular consequence of the translocation, the
5' regulatory region of the BCL6 gene was replaced by the putative 5' regulatory 
region of the Ikaros gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6
gene throughout B-cell differentiation. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of a
patient sample established that the t(3;7)(q27;p12) results in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. This study provides the first evidence that the Ikaros
gene is rearranged in human hematopoietic malignant disorders. (Blood.

The Ikaros gene has been implicated in lymphoid development and proliferation
from the results of gene targeting studies in mice. Recently we reported that the
Ikaros gene may be involved in the disease progression of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML). In this report, we investigated Ikaros isoforms in human
non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines and normal granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and
erythroid (BFU-E)-derived colonies. We evaluated Ikaros gene expression by
RT-PCR, Southern blotting, sequencing analysis, Northern blotting, and
immunoblotting.Ikaros isoforms Ik-1 and Ik-2, 3 were predominantly expressed in
human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Ik-4 and Ik-8 were also detectable as a
minor population. In contrast to the previous report in mice, multiple Ikaros
isoforms were expressed in human CFU-GM and BFU-E-derived colonies, and the
dominant-negative isoform Ik-6 was not detectable. We also showed that human
Ikaros isoforms contained an additional coding sequence in the N-terminal region,
which was highly homologous to the sequence reported in mice. These observations 
suggest that the Ikaros gene may play some role in the development of human
non-lymphoid lineage hematopoiesis. Moreover, the finding that the
dominant-negative isoform Ik-6, which was overexpressed in patients with blast
crisis of CML, was rarely detectable in non-lymphoid lineages supports its
pathogenetic role in human hematologic malignancies.

We have previously described a SWI/SNF-related protein complex (PYR complex) that
is restricted to definitive (adult-type) hematopoietic cells and that
specifically binds DNA sequences containing long stretches of pyrimidines.
Deletion of an intergenic DNA-binding site for this complex from a human
beta-globin locus construct results in delayed human gamma- to beta-globin
switching in transgenic mice, suggesting that the PYR complex acts to facilitate 
the switch. We now show that PYR complex DNA-binding activity also copurifies
with subunits of a second type of chromatin-remodeling complex,
nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase (NuRD), that has been shown to have both
nucleosome-remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. Gel supershift assays
using antibodies to the ATPase-helicase subunit of the NuRD complex, Mi-2 (CHD4),
confirm that Mi-2 is a component of the PYR complex. In addition, we show that
the hematopoietic cell-restricted zinc finger protein Ikaros copurifies with PYR 
complex DNA-binding activity and that antibodies to Ikaros also supershift the
complex. We also show that NuRD and SWI/SNF components coimmunopurify with each
other as well as with Ikaros. Competition gel shift experiments using partially
purified PYR complex and recombinant Ikaros protein indicate that Ikaros
functions as a DNA-binding subunit of the PYR complex. Our results suggest that
Ikaros targets two types of chromatin-remodeling factors-activators (SWI/SNF) and
repressors (NuRD)-in a single complex (PYR complex) to the beta-globin locus in
adult erythroid cells. At the time of the switch from fetal to adult globin
production, the PYR complex is assembled and may function to repress gamma-globin
gene expression and facilitate gamma- to beta-globin switching.

Eos and pegasus, two members of the Ikaros family of proteins with distinct DNA
binding activities.

Members of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, Ikaros, Aiolos, and
Helios, are expressed in lymphocytes and have been implicated in controlling
lymphoid development. These proteins contain two characteristic clusters of zinc 
fingers, an N-terminal domain important for DNA recognition, and a C-terminal
domain that mediates homo- and heterotypic associations between family members.
The conservation of these domains is such that all three proteins recognize
related DNA sequences, and all are capable of dimerizing with other family
members. Here we describe two additional Ikaros family proteins, Eos and Pegasus.
Eos is most highly related to Helios and shares its DNA binding and protein
association properties. Pegasus is related to other Ikaros proteins in its
C-terminal dimerization domain but contains a divergent N-terminal zinc finger
domain. Pegasus self-associates and binds to other family members but recognizes 
distinct DNA-binding sites. Eos and Pegasus repress the expression of reporter
genes containing their recognition elements. Our results suggest that these
proteins may associate with previously described Ikaros family proteins in
lymphoid cells and play additional roles in other tissues.

Targeting of Ikaros to pericentromeric heterochromatin by direct DNA binding.

Ikaros is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is essential for
lymphocyte development. Little is known about the molecular function of Ikaros,
although recent results have led to the hypothesis that it recruits genes
destined for heritable inactivation to foci containing pericentromeric
heterochromatin. To gain further insight into the functions of Ikaros, we have
examined the mechanism by which it is targeted to centromeric foci. Efficient
targeting of Ikaros was observed upon ectopic expression in 3T3 fibroblasts,
demonstrating that lymphocyte-specific proteins and a lymphoid nuclear
architecture are not required. Pericentromeric targeting did not result from an
interaction with the Mi-2 remodeling factor, as only a small percentage of Mi-2
localized to centromeric foci in 3T3 cells. Rather, targeting was dependent on
the amino-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger domain and carboxy-terminal
dimerization domain of Ikaros. The carboxy-terminal domain was required only for 
homodimerization, as targeting was restored when this domain was replaced with a 
leucine zipper. Surprisingly, a detailed substitution mutant analysis of the
amino-terminal domain revealed a close correlation between DNA-binding and
pericentromeric targeting. These results show that DNA binding is essential for
the pericentromeric localization of Ikaros, perhaps consistent with the presence 
of Ikaros binding sites within centromeric DNA repeats. Models for the function
of Ikaros that are consistent with this targeting mechanism are discussed.

Although information on the molecular pathways in radiation carcinogenesis is
accumulating, the data are still relatively scanty. To find the tumor suppressor 
locus associated with radiation carcinogenesis, we determined the frequency and
distribution of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas of
B6C3F(1) mice using 58 microsatellite markers and compared the results with those
for spontaneous lymphomas and N-ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-induced lymphomas. Based
on the results, we describe a unique locus with frequent LOH in the centromeric
region of chromosome 11 of X-ray-induced lymphomas. This locus has never been
observed to be altered similarly in either ENU-induced or spontaneous lymphomas, 
suggesting radiation-specific molecular alteration. The LOH patterns of
individual thymic lymphomas indicated that the common region of LOH was located
within 1.6 cM between D11Mit62 and D11Mit204, a region syntenic to human
chromosome 7p13. Linkage analysis revealed that the markers of the common LOH
region were genetically linked to Ikaros (now known as Znfn1a1), a master gene of
lymphopoiesis. Although the presence of radiation-associated LOH in other loci
cannot be ruled out, these results suggest a novel molecular pathway in induction
of thymic lymphomas by ionizing radiation.

Gene targeting studies in mice have shown that the transcription factor Ikaros
plays an essential role in lymphoid development and as a tumor suppressor in T
cells, whereas the related gene Aiolos functions as a tumor suppressor in B
cells. We analyzed the expression levels of the Ikaros gene family, Ikaros and
Aiolos, in human bone marrow samples from patients with adult acute lymphoblastic
leukemia [ALL (n = 46; B-cell ALL = 41; T-cell ALL = 5)]. Overexpression of the
dominant negative isoform of Ikaros gene Ik-6 was observed in 14 of 41 B-cell ALL
patients by reverse transcription-PCR, and the results were confirmed by
sequencing analysis and immunoblotting. None of the other dominant negative
isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. 
Southern blotting analysis with PstI digestion revealed that those patients with 
the dominant negative isoform Ik-6 might have small mutations in the Ikaros
locus. We did not detect any overexpression of dominant negative isoforms of
Aiolos in adult ALL patients. These results suggest that Ikaros plays a key role 
in human B-cell malignancies through the dominant negative isoform Ik-6.

Members of the Ikaros multigene family of zinc finger proteins are expressed in a
tissue-specific manner and most are critical determinants in the development of
both the B and T lymphocytes as well as NK and dendritic APC lineages. A PCR
amplification strategy that is based on regions of shared sequence identity in
Ikaros multigene family members found in mammals and several other vertebrates
has led to the recovery of cDNAs that represent the orthologues of Ikaros,
Aiolos, Helios, and Eos in Raja eglanteria (clearnose skate), a cartilaginous
fish that is representative of an early divergence event in the phylogenetic
diversification of the vertebrates. The tissue-specific patterns of expression
for at least two of the four Ikaros family members in skate resemble the patterns
observed in mammals, i.e., in hematopoietic tissues. Prominent expression of
Ikaros in skate also is found in the lymphoid Leydig organ and epigonal tissues, 
which are unique to cartilaginous fish. An Ikaros-related gene has been
identified in Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey), a jawless vertebrate species, in 
which neither Ig nor TCRs have been identified. In addition to establishing a
high degree of evolutionary conservation of the Ikaros multigene family from
cartilaginous fish through mammals, these studies define a possible link between 
factors that regulate the differentiation of immune-type cells in the jawed
vertebrates and related factors of unknown function in jawless vertebrates.

Ikaros interactions with CtBP reveal a repression mechanism that is independent
of histone deacetylase activity.

Koipally J(1), Georgopoulos K.

Author information: 
(1)Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard 
Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.

We have previously shown that Ikaros can repress transcription through the
recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes. Here we provide evidence that
Ikaros can also repress transcription through its interactions with the
co-repressor, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). CtBP interacts with Ikaros
isoforms through a PEDLS motif present at the N terminus of these proteins but
not with homologues like Aiolos which lack this motif. Mutations in Ikaros that
prevent CtBP interactions reduce its ability to repress transcription. CtBP
interacts with Sin3A but not with the Mi-2 co-repressor and it represses
transcription in a manner that is independent of histone deacetylase activity.
These data strongly suggest that CtBP contributes to a histone deacetylase
activity independent mechanism of repression by Ikaros. Finally, we show that the
viral oncoprotein E1A, which binds to CtBP, also shows a strong association with 
Ikaros. This Ikaros-E1A interaction may underlie Ikaros's decreased ability to
repress transcription in E1A transformed cells.

Buildings, Edinburgh, UK EH9 3JR.

Over the past few years, the long-standing idea that covalent modification of
chromatin can play a role in determining states of gene activity has been
confirmed. Eukaryotic genes can be silenced by deacetylation of acetyl-lysine
moieties in the N-terminal tails of histones. Recent work links histone
deacetylases with an increasing number of repressors, suggesting that
deacetylation might be a rather pervasive feature of transcriptional repression
systems.

The molecular and cellular requirements for the development of different
populations of human dendritic cells (DC) were studied. Conditions were defined
that support DC production from lymphoid progenitors but that fail to induce DC
formation from peripheral monocytes. The production of these lymphoid-related DC 
was severely blocked when hematopoietic progenitors overexpressed Ik7, a mutant
dominant-negative Ikaros protein. In contrast, Ik7 did not block the formation of
DC in conditions supporting the development of monocyte-derived DC. Furthermore, 
Ik7 did not block the formation of monocyte/macrophages and enhanced
granulopoiesis. One of the molecular mechanisms mediated by Ik7 appears to be
down-regulation of the flt3-receptor mRNA. Thus, distinct signals control the
formation of DC demonstrating that some aspects of DC diversity are determined in
part by distinct molecular cues at the hematopoietic level. (Blood.

PURPOSE: We sought to determine if molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros
gene could contribute to the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in
children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied Ikaros gene expression in normal human bone
marrow, normal thymocytes, normal fetal liver-derived immature lymphocyte
precursor cell lines, eight different ALL cell lines, and leukemic cells from 69 
children with ALL (T-lineage ALL, n = 18; B-lineage ALL, n = 51). Expression of
Ikaros protein and its subcellular localization were examined by immunoblotting
and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and nucleotide sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros
isoforms expressed in these cells. Genomic sequencing of splice junction regions 
of the Ikaros gene was performed in search for mutations.
RESULTS: In each of the ALL cases, we found high-level expression of a
non-DNA-binding or aberrant DNA-binding isoform of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. In contrast, only wild-type Ik-1 and
Ik-2 isoforms with normal subcellular localization were found in normal bone
marrow cells and thymus-derived or fetal liver-derived normal lymphocyte
precursors. In leukemic cells expressing the aberrant Ikaros coding sequences
with the 30-base-pair deletion, genomic sequence analysis of the intron-exon
junctions between exons 6 and 7 yielded the wild-type sequence. We identified a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting the third base of the triplet
codon for a proline (CCC or CCA) in the highly conserved bipartite activation
region (viz, A or C at position 1002 numbering from the translation start site of
Ik-1) within our Ikaros clones. Bi-allelic expression of truncated and/or
non-DNA-binding isoforms along with wild-type isoforms was observed in leukemic
cells, which implicates trans-acting factor(s) affecting splice site recognition.
CONCLUSION: Our findings link specific molecular defects involving the Ikaros
gene to childhood ALL. Posttranscriptional regulation of alternative splicing of 
Ikaros RNA seems to be defective in leukemic lymphocyte precursors from most
children with ALL. Consequently, leukemic cells from ALL patients, in contrast to
normal lymphocyte precursors, express high levels of non-DNA-binding Ikaros
isoforms that are reminiscent of the non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms that lead to
lymphoblastic leukemia in mice.

Ikaros, a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein, is required for normal
lymphocyte development. Germ-line mutant mice that express only non-DNA binding
dominant-negative "leukemogenic" Ikaros isoforms lacking critical NH2-terminal
zinc fingers develop an aggressive form of T-cell leukemia. We studied Ikaros
gene expression in leukemic cells from 18 children with T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In each of the 18 T-ALL cases as well as JK-E6-1 
and MOLT-3 cell lines, we found high-level expression of dominant-negative
isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal subcellular compartmentalization patterns.
Nuclear extracts from these cells failed to bind to the IKAROS-specific binding
sequence in DNA. PCR cloning and sequencing confirmed that JK-E6-1 and MOLT-3
cell lines as well as leukemic cells from 9 of 10 patients with T-ALL expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8 that lack critical
NH2-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 10 patients, we detected a specific mutation
leading to an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (delta KSSMPQKFLG) upstream to 
the transcription activation domain and adjacent to the COOH-terminal zinc
fingers of Ik-2, Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8. Thus, children with T-ALL express high
levels of dysfunctional dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms.

Gene targeting studies in mice have shown that the lack of Ikaros activity leads 
to T-cell hyperproliferation and T-cell neoplasia, establishing the Ikaros gene
as a tumor suppressor gene in mice. This prompted us to investigate whether
mutations in Ikaros play a role in human hematological malignancies. Reverse
transcription-PCR was used to determine the relative expression levels of Ikaros 
isoforms in a panel of human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and human bone marrow
samples from patients with hematological malignancies. Among the cell lines
examined, only BV-173, which was derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) patient in lymphoid blast crisis, overexpressed the dominant-negative
isoform, Ik-6. In 9 of 17 samples of patients in blast crisis of CML, Ikaros
activity had been reduced either by drastically reducing mRNA expression (4 of
17) or by overexpressing the dominant-negative isoform Ik-6 (5 of 17).
Significantly, expression of Ikaros isoforms seemed normal in chronic phase CML
patients and patients with other hematological malignancies. In some cases,
overexpression of the dominant-negative Ik-6 protein was confirmed by Western
blot analysis, and Southern blot analysis indicated that decreases in Ikaros
activity correlated with a mutation in the Ikaros locus. In summary, these
findings suggest that a reduction of Ikaros activity may be an important step in 
the development of blast crisis in CML and provide further evidence that
mutations that alter Ikaros expression may contribute to human hematological
malignancies.

Development and maturation of secondary lymphoid tissues.

The secondary lymphoid tissues are located at strategic sites where foreign
antigens can be efficiently brought together with immune system regulatory and
effector cells. The organized structure of the secondary lymphoid tissues is
thought to enhance the sensitivity of antigen recognition and to support proper
regulation of the activation and maturation of the antigen-responsive lymphoid
cells. Although a substantial amount is known about the cellular elements that
compose the lymphoid and nonlymphoid components of the secondary lymphoid
tissues, information concerning the signals that control the development of the
tissues and that maintain the organized tissue microenvironment remain undefined.
Studies over the past few years have identified lymphotoxin as a critical
signaling molecule not only for the organogenesis of secondary lymphoid tissues
but for the maintenance of aspects of their microarchitecture as well. Additional
signaling molecules that contribute to the formation of normal lymphoid tissue
structure are being identified at an accelerating pace. Analyses of mouse strains
with congenital defects in different aspects of secondary lymphoid tissue
development are beginning to clarify the role of these tissues in immune
responses and host defense. This review focuses on studies defining recently
identified crucial signals for the biogenesis of secondary lymphoid organs and
for the maintenance of their proper microarchitecture. It also discusses new
insights into how the structure of these tissues supports effective immune
responses.

Repression by Ikaros and Aiolos is mediated through histone deacetylase
complexes.

Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can 
function as strong transcriptional repressors. This function is mediated through 
two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type. 
Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones
at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors. Consistent
with these findings, Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and
in vitro with the mSin3 family of co-repressors which bind to histone
deacetylases. Based on these and our recent findings of associations between
Ikaros and Mi-2-HDAC, we propose that Ikaros family members modulate gene
expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone
deacetylase complexes to specific promoters.

Lymphoid cell differentiation relies on precisely orchestrated gene activation
and repression events. Gene targeting studies have demonstrated crucial roles for
the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos in regulating multiple stages of B
and T cell development. Recent experiments suggest that Ikaros and Aiolos set B
cell antigen-receptor (BCR)- and TCR-mediated signaling thresholds and that the
molecules exist within T cells in nuclear complexes that contain nucleosome
remodeling and histone deacetylase activities.

Ikaros, a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein, is required for normal
lymphocyte development, and germline mutant mice that express only non-DNA
binding dominant-negative "leukemogenic" Ikaros isoforms lacking critical
N-terminal zinc fingers develop an aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3-6 
months after birth. Therefore, we sought to determine whether molecular
abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene could contribute to the development of
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants. Primary leukemic cells were
freshly obtained from 12 infants (<1 year of age) with newly diagnosed ALL. In
leukemic cells from each of the 12 infants with ALL, we found high level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal subcellular
compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide sequencing were used to
identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect Ikaros gene mutations in these
cells. Leukemic cells from seven of seven infants with ALL, including five of
five MLL-AF4(+) infants, expressed dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms Ik-4, Ik-7, 
and Ik-8 that lack critical N-terminal zinc fingers. In six of seven patients, we
detected a specific mutation leading to an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids
(Delta KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the transcription activation domain adjacent to
the C-terminal zinc fingers of Ik-2, Ik-4, Ik-7, and Ik-8. In contrast, only
wild-type Ik-1 and Ik-2 isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in
normal infant bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicate
the expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of normal 
Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Down-regulation of human granzyme B expression by glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone 
inhibits binding to the Ikaros and AP-1 regulatory elements of the granzyme B
promoter.

The serine protease granzyme B is an essential component of the granule
exocytosis pathway, a major apoptotic mechanism used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes
and natural killer cells to induce target cell apoptosis. Granzyme B gene
transcription is induced in activated lymphocytes upon antigenic stimulation, and
several regulatory regions including CBF, AP-1, and Ikaros binding sites have
been shown to be essential in the control of granzyme B promoter activation.
Dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid that is widely used as an immunomodulatory and
anti-inflammatory agent, inhibits granzyme B mRNA transcript in
phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Transfection of 
a reporter construct containing the -148 to +60 region of the human granzyme B
promoter demonstrated that this region was the target for dexamethasone
repression. Mutation of Ikaros or AP-1 binding sites in the context of the
granzyme B promoter demonstrated that both sites participate in
dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the granzyme B promoter activity.
Electromobility shift assay revealed that dexamethasone abolished the binding of 
nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros binding site and reduced AP-1 binding
activity. These results indicate that dexamethasone is able to abrogate the
transcriptional activity of the human granzyme B gene promoter by inhibiting the 
binding of nuclear factors at the AP-1 and Ikaros sites.

A 47-amino-acid fragment of SV40 T antigen represses transcription from human
GSTalpha promoters.

SV40 T antigen downregulates the expression of an important detoxification
enzyme, glutathione S-transferase alpha (GSTalpha). We show here that the target 
of this repression is a 14-bp element common to the human GSTA1 and GSTA2
promoters. This element, which we have named TAGR, is also critical for
high-level, constitutive expression from these promoters. The TAGR element does
not appear to contain a binding site for any transcription factor known to be
present in fibroblasts, although the TAGR element does resemble the binding site 
for the Ikaros transcription factor found in hematopoietic cells. We also have
identified a 47-amino-acid fragment of T antigen that includes amino acids 83-100
and 119-147, which is sufficient to repress transcription from the GSTalpha
promoter in transient transcription assays. Thus, GSTalpha repression does not
require binding of T antigen to pRb, p300, or p53, since the domains of T antigen
required for binding these cellular proteins are missing from this T antigen
fragment. We show, however, that this fragment does bind to three cellular
proteins with approximate molecular weights of 54, 59, and 94 kDa.

Ikaros in hemopoietic lineage determination and homeostasis.

Medical School, Charlestown 02129, USA.

Studies on the molecular mechanisms that control hemopoietic differentiation have
focused on signaling cascades and nuclear effectors that drive this complex
developmental system in a regulated fashion. Here we review the role of Ikaros,
the founding member of a unique family of zinc finger transcription factors in
this developmental process. Studies on an Ikaros null mutation have revealed an
essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at
subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway. Differences in
the phenotypes of a null and a dominant negative (DN) Ikaros mutation provide
insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros proteins exert their
effects in development. In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic
stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros mutations
reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros in the production and 
differentiation of these populations.

The role of the Ikaros gene in lymphocyte development and homeostasis.

Medical School, Charlestown 02129, USA.

The Ikaros gene, which encodes a family of hemopoietic-specific zinc finger
proteins, is described as a central regulator of lymphocyte differentiation.
During fetal development, it is required at the earliest stage of T cell and B
cell specification. In the adult, however, lymphoid lineages rely on Ikaros at
distinct phases of their development. Its activity is essential for the
generation of B cell but not of T cell precursors, although the differentiation
of the latter is not normal. A significant increase in CD4 thymocytes and their
immediate precursors is detected, and because these cells lack markers that
correlate with positive selection, a deregulation in their maturation process is 
suggested. Furthermore, Ikaros-null thymocytes hyperproliferate in response to T 
cell receptor (TCR) signaling; within days after their appearance in the thymus, 
clonally expanding populations are detected. Deregulated TCR-mediated responses
and the fast kinetics of tumor development in these mutant thymocytes implicate
Ikaros as a central tumor suppressor gene for the T cell lineage. In addition,
lack of natural killer cells and selective defects in gamma delta T cells and
dendritic antigen-presenting cells point to Ikaros as an essential factor for the
establishment of early branchpoints of the T cell pathway. The dominant
interference activity of Ikaros isoforms unable to bind DNA and their effects in 
lymphocyte development suggest that Ikaros works in concert with other factors.
The role of Aiolos, a lymphoid-restricted and structurally related gene, in
lymphoid differentiation is discussed. A model is proposed that defines Ikaros as
the backbone of a complex regulatory protein network that controls cell fate
decisions and regulates homeostasis in the hemo-lymphoid system. Changes in this 
regulatory network may reflect differentiation and proliferation adjustments made
in hemo-lymphoid progenitors and precursors as they give rise to the cells of our
immune system.

The Ikaros gene encodes a family of lymphocyte-restricted zinc finger DNA binding
proteins, highly conserved in human and mouse.

The Ikaros gene is an essential regulator in the development and homeostasis of
the mouse lymphopoietic system. To study the role of the Ikaros gene in the human
lymphopoietic system, we cloned and characterized human Ikaros cDNAs. In the
human, as in the mouse, differential splicing of Ikaros primary transcripts
generates a family of lymphoid-restricted zinc finger DNA binding proteins,
highly conserved in sequence composition and relative expression to the mouse
homologues. Expression of Ikaros isoforms is highly restricted to the
lymphopoietic system and is particularly enriched in maturing thymocytes. The
Ikaros gene maps at a syntenic locus located on the short arm of human chromosome
7 and on mouse chromosome 11 next to the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr).
The high degree of conservation of the Ikaros gene at the genetic and expression 
levels strongly suggests that it plays a fundamental role in the ontogeny of the 
lymphopoietic system across species.

Granzyme B serine protease is found in the granules of activated cytotoxic T
cells and in natural and lymphokine-activated killer cells. This protease plays a
critical role in the rapid induction of target cell DNA fragmentation. The DNA
regulatory elements that are responsible for the specificity of granzyme B gene
transcription in activated T-cells reside between nt -148 and +60 (relative to
the transcription start point at +1) of the human granzyme B gene promoter. This 
region contains binding sites for the transcription factors Ikaros, CBF, Ets, and
AP-1. Mutational analysis of the human granzyme B promoter reveals that the
Ikaros binding site (-143 to -114) and the AP-1/CBF binding site (-103 to -77)
are essential for the activation of transcription in phytohemagglutinin-activated
peripheral blood lymphocytes, whereas mutation of the Ets binding site does not
affect promoter activity in these cells.
