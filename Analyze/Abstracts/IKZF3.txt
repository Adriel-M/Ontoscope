OBJECTIVES: To replicate the association of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
susceptibility loci in an independent European sample and to assess their
specificity with anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) status.
METHODS: A selection of 64 SNP previously associated with RA have been typed in a
cohort of 267 RA patients (169 ACPA-positive and 98 ACPA-negative) and 152
controls from the Rheumatology Units of the University Hospital of Pisa (Italy)
and the University of Pécs Medical Center (Hungary). Regression analyses were
performed first considering overall RA patients and secondly, taking both
serotype subgroups as different disease entities. The results have been adjusted 
for age, gender and origin of individuals.
RESULTS: The well-known CD2, REL, TNFAIP3, IRF5, PTPRC, and CCR6 have been
confirmed as RA disease associated loci together with recently discovered BACH2, 
RASGRP1, and IKZF3 loci, taking all RA patients as a unique phenotype. Results
from both serological subgroups separately reflect the specificity of these
susceptibility loci and show additional ACPA-positive specific associations for
variants at IL6R, IL2RA, BLK, DDX6, IL6, and TLE3 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from GAPAID project are consistent with previously
established RA disease associations for CD2, PTPRC, REL, CCR6, TNFAIP3, IRF5,
BLK, IL2RA, and DDX6 loci. In addition, IL6R, BACH2, RASGRP1, TLE3, and IKZF3 are
replicated for the first time in an independent European population and IL6
appears to be a suggestive new RA associated locus. The stratified analysis based
on ACPA status provides further support for distinct genetic aetiologies of RA
subsets, which might have therapeutic implications.

Pomalidomide is an IMiD(®) immunomodulatory agent, which has shown clinically
significant benefits in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM)
patients when combined with dexamethasone, regardless of refractory status to
lenalidomide or bortezomib. (Schey et al, ; San Miguel et al, 2013; Richardson
et al, 2014; Scott, ) In this work, we present preclinical data showing that the 
combination of pomalidomide with dexamethasone (PomDex) demonstrates potent
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in both lenalidomide-sensitive and 
lenalidomide-resistant MM cell lines. PomDex also synergistically inhibited
tumour growth compared with single-agent treatment in xenografts of
lenalidomide-resistant H929 R10-1 cells. Typical hallmarks of IMiD compound
activity, including IKZF3 (Aiolos) degradation, and the downregulation of
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 4 and MYC, seen in lenalidomide-sensitive H929
MM cell lines, were also observed in PomDex-treated lenalidomide-resistant H929
MM cells. Remarkably, this resulted in strong, synergistic effects on the
induction of apoptosis in both lenalidomide-sensitive and resistant MM cells.
Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed a unique differential gene
expression pattern in PomDex-treated samples, highlighted by the modulation of
pro-apoptotic pathways in lenalidomide-resistant cells. These results provide key
insights into molecular mechanisms of PomDex in the lenalidomide-resistant
setting.

Structural basis of lenalidomide-induced CK1a degradation by the CRL4(CRBN)
ubiquitin ligase.

Thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are immune
modulatory drugs (IMiDs) used in the treatment of haematologic malignancies.
IMiDs bind CRBN, the substrate receptor of the CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (also known as
CRL4(CRBN)) E3 ubiquitin ligase, and inhibit ubiquitination of endogenous
CRL4(CRBN) substrates. Unexpectedly, IMiDs also repurpose the ligase to target
new proteins for degradation. Lenalidomide induces degradation of the lymphoid
transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos (also known as IKZF1 and IKZF3), and
casein kinase 1a (CK1a), which contributes to its clinical efficacy in the
treatment of multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion associated myelodysplastic syndrome
(del(5q) MDS), respectively. How lenalidomide alters the specificity of the
ligase to degrade these proteins remains elusive. Here we present the 2.45 Å
crystal structure of DDB1-CRBN bound to lenalidomide and CK1a. CRBN and
lenalidomide jointly provide the binding interface for a CK1a ß-hairpin-loop
located in the kinase N-lobe. We show that CK1a binding to CRL4(CRBN) is strictly
dependent on the presence of an IMiD. Binding of IKZF1 to CRBN similarly requires
the compound and both, IKZF1 and CK1a, use a related binding mode. Our study
provides a mechanistic explanation for the selective efficacy of lenalidomide in 
del(5q) MDS therapy. We anticipate that high-affinity protein-protein
interactions induced by small molecules will provide opportunities for drug
development, particularly for targeted protein degradation.

Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and
pomalidomide are efficacious in the treatment of multiple myeloma and
significantly prolong their survival. However, the mechanisms of such effects of 
IMiDs have not been fully elucidated. Recently, cereblon has been identified as a
target binding protein of thalidomide. Lenalidomide-resistant myeloma cell lines 
often lose the expression of cereblon, suggesting that IMiDs act as an
anti-myeloma agent through interacting with cereblon. Cereblon binds to damaged
DNA-binding protein and functions as a ubiquitin ligase, inducing degradation of 
IKZF1 and IKZF3 that are essential transcription factors for B and T cell
development. Degradation of both IKZF1 and IKZF3 reportedly suppresses myeloma
cell growth. Here, we found that IMiDs act as inhibitors of DNA
methyltransferases (DMNTs). We previously reported that PU.1, which is an ETS
family transcription factor and essential for myeloid and lymphoid development,
functions as a tumor suppressor in myeloma cells. PU.1 induces growth arrest and 
apoptosis of myeloma cell lines. In this study, we found that low-dose
lenalidomide and pomalidomide up-regulate PU.1 expression through inducing
demethylation of the PU.1 promoter. In addition, IMiDs inhibited DNMT1, DNMT3a,
and DNMT3b activities in vitro. Furthermore, lenalidomide and pomalidomide
decreased the methylation status of the whole genome in myeloma cells.
Collectively, IMiDs exert demethylation activity through inhibiting DNMT1, 3a,
and 3b, and up-regulating PU.1 expression, which may be one of the mechanisms of 
the anti-myeloma activity of IMiDs.

PURPOSE: To investigate the genetic and epigenetic landscape of hypodiploid (<45 
chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphism array, whole exome sequencing, RNA
sequencing, and methylation array analyses were performed on eleven hypodiploid
ALL cases.
RESULTS: In line with previous studies, mutations in IKZF3 and FLT3 were detected
in near-haploid (25-30 chromosomes) cases. Low hypodiploidy (31-39 chromosomes)
was associated with somatic TP53 mutations. Notably, mutations of this gene were 
also found in 3/3 high hypodiploid (40-44 chromosomes) cases, suggesting that the
mutational patterns are similar in low hypodiploid and high hypodiploid ALL. The 
high hypodiploid ALLs frequently displayed substantial cell-to-cell variability
in chromosomal content, indicative of chromosomal instability; a rare phenomenon 
in ALL. Gene expression analysis showed that genes on heterodisomic chromosomes
were more highly expressed in hypodiploid cases. Cases clustered according to
hypodiploid subtype in the unsupervised methylation analyses, but there was no
association between chromosomal copy number and methylation levels. A comparison 
between samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse showed that the relapse did not
arise from the major diagnostic clone in 3/4 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data support the conclusion that near-haploid
and low hypodiploid ALL are different with regard to mutational profiles and also
suggest that ALL cases with high hypodiploidy may harbor chromosomal instability.

Eczema often precedes the development of asthma in a disease course called the
'atopic march'. To unravel the genes underlying this characteristic pattern of
allergic disease, we conduct a multi-stage genome-wide association study on
infantile eczema followed by childhood asthma in 12 populations including 2,428
cases and 17,034 controls. Here we report two novel loci specific for the
combined eczema plus asthma phenotype, which are associated with allergic disease
for the first time; rs9357733 located in EFHC1 on chromosome 6p12.3 (OR 1.27;
P=2.1 × 10(-8)) and rs993226 between TMTC2 and SLC6A15 on chromosome 12q21.3 (OR 
1.58; P=5.3 × 10(-9)). Additional susceptibility loci identified at genome-wide
significance are FLG (1q21.3), IL4/KIF3A (5q31.1), AP5B1/OVOL1 (11q13.1),
C11orf30/LRRC32 (11q13.5) and IKZF3 (17q21). We show that predominantly eczema
loci increase the risk for the atopic march. Our findings suggest that eczema may
play an important role in the development of asthma after eczema.

Lenalidomide and its related 'analogues' modulate the substrate specificity of
the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Polyubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 in multiple myeloma and CK1a in
del(5q) MDS has recently been linked to therapeutic efficacy of this class of
compounds. Harnessing ubiquitin ligase substrate specificity, may in time
facilitate the degradation of other 'undruggable' proteins and allow for
separation of detrimental side effects of IMiD compounds from those associated
with therapeutic efficacy.

To investigate the biological foundation of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, susceptibility locus rs2872507, we have
investigated the expression of 13 genes using ileal and colonic biopsies from
patients with IBD (inflamed and noninflamed mucosa) or from individuals without
IBD (noninflamed mucosa). The susceptibility allele was consistently associated
with reduced expression of GSDMB (P = 4.1 × 10(-3)-7.2 × 10(-10)). The
susceptibility allele was also associated with the increased expression of GSDMA 
(P = 1.6 × 10(-4)) and LRRC3C (P = 7.8 × 10(-6)) in colon tissue from individuals
without IBD and with the reduced expression of PGAP3 (IBD; P = 2.0 × 10(-3)) and 
ZPBP2 (Crohn's disease; P = 7.7 × 10(-4)) in noninflamed ileum. Inflammation
resulted in the reduced colonic expression of ERBB2, GRB7, MIEN1, and PGAP3 (P = 
1.0 × 10(-4)-1.0 × 10(-9)) and the increased colonic expression of IKZF3 and CSF3
(P = 2.4 × 10(-7)-3.5 × 10(-8)). Based on our results and published findings on
GSDMA, GSDMB, LRRC3C, and related proteins, we propose that this locus in part
affects IBD susceptibility via effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation and
believe this hypothesis warrants further experimental investigation.

Which genetic alterations drive tumorigenesis and how they evolve over the course
of disease and therapy are central questions in cancer biology. Here we identify 
44 recurrently mutated genes and 11 recurrent somatic copy number variations
through whole-exome sequencing of 538 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and
matched germline DNA samples, 278 of which were collected in a prospective
clinical trial. These include previously unrecognized putative cancer drivers
(RPS15, IKZF3), and collectively identify RNA processing and export, MYC
activity, and MAPK signalling as central pathways involved in CLL. Clonality
analysis of this large data set further enabled reconstruction of temporal
relationships between driver events. Direct comparison between matched
pre-treatment and relapse samples from 59 patients demonstrated highly frequent
clonal evolution. Thus, large sequencing data sets of clinically informative
samples enable the discovery of novel genes associated with cancer, the network
of relationships between the driver events, and their impact on disease relapse
and clinical outcome.

Lenalidomide acts by a novel drug mechanism-modulation of the substrate
specificity of the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase. In multiple myeloma,
lenalidomide induces the ubiquitination of IKZF1 and IKZF3 by CRL4(CRBN).
Subsequent proteasomal degradation of these transcription factors kills multiple 
myeloma cells. In del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome, lenalidomide induces the
degradation of CK1a, which preferentially affects del(5q) cells because they
express this gene at haploinsufficient levels. In the future, modulation of
ubiquitin ligase function may enable us to target previously "undruggable"
proteins.

Recent discoveries suggest that the critical events leading to the
anti-proliferative activity of the IMiD immunomodulatory agents lenalidomide and 
pomalidomide in multiple myeloma (MM) cells are initiated by Cereblon-dependent
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of substrate proteins Ikaros (IKZF1)
and Aiolos (IKZF3). By performing kinetic analyses, we found that the
downregulation or proteasomal degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos led to specific
and sequential downregulation of c-Myc followed by IRF4 and subsequent growth
inhibition and apoptosis. Notably, to ensure growth inhibition and cell death,
sustained downregulation of Ikaros and Aiolos, c-Myc or IRF4 expression was
required. In addition, we found that the half-maximal rate, rather than the final
extent of Ikaros and Aiolos degradation, correlated to the relative efficacy of
growth inhibition by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Finally, we observed that all 
four transcription factors were elevated in primary MM samples compared with
normal plasma cells. Taken together, our results suggest a functional link
between Ikaros and Aiolos, and the pathological dysregulation of c-Myc and IRF4, 
and provide a new mechanistic understanding of the relative efficacy of
lenalidomide and pomalidomide based on the kinetics of substrate degradation and 
downregulation of their downstream targets.

The cullin 4 subfamily of genes includes CUL4A and CUL4B, which share a mostly
identical amino acid sequence aside from the elongated N-terminal region in
CUL4B. Both act as scaffolding proteins for modular cullin RING ligase 4 (CRL4)
complexes which promote the ubiquitination of a variety of substrates. CRL4
function is vital to cells as loss of both genes or their shared substrate
adaptor protein DDB1 halts proliferation and eventually leads to cell death. Due 
to their high structural similarity, CUL4A and CUL4B share a substantial overlap 
in function. However, in some cases, differences in subcellular localization,
spatiotemporal expression patterns and stress-inducibility preclude functional
compensation. In this review, we highlight the most essential functions of the
CUL4 genes in: DNA repair and replication, chromatin-remodeling, cell cycle
regulation, embryogenesis, hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis. CUL4 genes are also
clinically relevant as dysregulation can contribute to the onset of cancer and
CRL4 complexes are often hijacked by certain viruses to promote viral replication
and survival. Also, mutations in CUL4B have been implicated in a subset of
patients suffering from syndromic X-linked intellectual disability (AKA mental
retardation). Interestingly, the antitumor effects of immunomodulatory drugs are 
caused by their binding to the CRL4CRBN complex and re-directing the E3 ligase
towards the Ikaros transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3. Because of their
influence over key cellular functions and relevance to human disease, CRL4s are
considered promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in
African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic
susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the 
number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution 
of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We
performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD
susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new
associated loci.
METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls) from 34 IBD centers
in the United States; additional controls were collected from 4 other Immunochip 
studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088 patients with
Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type unknown, and 1797 
controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed.
RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between ulcerative colitis and 
HLA rs9271366 (P = 7.5 × 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and 5p13.1 rs4286721 (P = 3.5 ×
10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P = 2.3 × 10(-6)). Additional suggestive
associations (P < 4.2 × 10(-5)) were observed between Crohn's disease and IBD and
African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3; between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, 
and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis and SNPs near HDAC11 and near
LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been previously associated with IBD, but
require replication. Established Caucasian associations were replicated in AAs (P
< 3.1 × 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3, and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P < 3.9
× 10(-4)) was observed for 17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3),
10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and 16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed
significant enrichment (false discovery rate <1 × 10(-5)) in genes that encode
members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well
those involved in pathogenesis of measles.
CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found
that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association
evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci
not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine
risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further
study.

Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have potent anti-tumor activities in multiple
myeloma (MM) and are able to enhance the cytotoxic function of natural killer
(NK) cells, important effectors of the immune response against MM. Here, we show 
that these drugs can enhance the expression of the NKG2D and DNAM-1 activating
receptor ligands MICA and PVR/CD155 in human MM cell lines and primary malignant 
plasma cells. Depletion of cereblon (CRBN) by shRNA interference strongly
impaired upregulation of these ligands and, more interestingly,
IMiDs/CRBN-mediated downregulation of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1),
Aiolos (IKZF3) and IRF4 was critical for these regulatory mechanisms. Indeed,
shRNA knockdown of IKZF1 or IKZF3 expression was both necessary and sufficient
for the upregulation of MICA and PVR/CD155 expression, suggesting that these
transcription factors can repress these genes; accordingly, the direct
interaction and the negative role of IKZF1 and IKZF3 proteins on MICA and
PVR/CD155 promoters were demonstrated. Finally, MICA expression was enhanced in
IRF4-silenced cells, indicating a specific suppressive role of this transcription
factor on MICA gene expression in MM cells.Taken together, these findings
describe novel molecular pathways involved in the regulation of MICA and
PVR/CD155 gene expression and identify the transcription factors IKZF-1/IKZF-3
and IRF4 as repressors of these genes in MM cells.

The production of mature eosinophils (Eos) is a tightly orchestrated process with
the aim to sustain normal Eos levels in tissues while also maintaining low
numbers of these complex and sensitive cells in the blood. To identify regulators
of homeostatic eosinophilopoiesis in mice, we took a global approach to identify 
genome-wide transcriptome and epigenome changes that occur during homeostasis at 
critical developmental stages, including Eos-lineage commitment and lineage
maturation. Our analyses revealed a markedly greater number of transcriptome
alterations associated with Eos maturation (1199 genes) than with Eos-lineage
commitment (490 genes), highlighting the greater transcriptional investment
necessary for differentiation. Eos-lineage-committed progenitors (EoPs) were
noted to express high levels of granule proteins and contain granules with an
ultrastructure distinct from that of mature resting Eos. Our analyses also
delineated a 976-gene Eos-lineage transcriptome that included a repertoire of 56 
transcription factors, many of which have never previously been associated with
Eos. EoPs and Eos, but not granulocyte-monocyte progenitors or neutrophils,
expressed Helios and Aiolos, members of the Ikaros family of transcription
factors, which regulate gene expression via modulation of chromatin structure and
DNA accessibility. Epigenetic studies revealed a distinct distribution of active 
chromatin marks between genes induced with lineage commitment and genes induced
with cell maturation during Eos development. In addition, Aiolos and Helios
binding sites were significantly enriched in genes expressed by EoPs and Eos with
active chromatin, highlighting a potential novel role for Helios and Aiolos in
regulating gene expression during Eos development.

BACKGROUND: Pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTIDs)
are rare lesions. The differential diagnosis and management strategy for PPTIDs
can be challenging because of the variable prognostic and pathologic
characteristics of these tumors.
METHODS: A 24-year-old man presented with progressive headaches, gait
abnormalities, and abulia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large
T1-hypointense, T2-isointense, contrast-enhancing, partially cystic mass of the
pineal and tectal region. Near-total resection was achieved in a 2-stage
operation followed by focal and craniospinal irradiation and adjuvant
chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis including use of pineal lineage marker
confirmed a diagnosis of PPTID. Targeted exome sequencing showed mutations in
TSC1(L388P) and IKZF3(F206C), whereas high-resolution array cytogenetics revealed
losses in chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 17, and 20, leading to single-copy loss
of PTEN and TP53.
CONCLUSIONS: Pineal parenchymal tumors reflect a broad spectrum of malignancy
potential and prognoses, which mandate better understanding of the disease
mechanism for rational therapeutic strategies. We present a case of PPTID and
report several mutations and chromosomal abnormalities previously unrecognized in
this tumor subtype. Review of the literature highlights a need for surgical
resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. Further investigation of these
novel variants may improve understanding of the pathogenesis underlying pineal
parenchymal tumors.

OBJECTIVES: Chromosomal ploidy is a major risk stratification tool for acute
B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Low hypodiploidy and near-haploidy are
thought to be confined to pediatric B-ALL and associated with a poor prognosis.
Doubling of either a low-hypodiploid or a near-haploid clone results in an
apparently high-hyperdiploid karyotype, which is often misclassified for risk.
METHODS: We studied four patients with B-ALL who had chromosome genomic array
testing (CGAT), along with fluorescence in situ hybridization and mutation
testing.
RESULTS: We identified a unique case of adult B-ALL with masked low hypodiploidy 
(mLH) by genomic duplication, along with a somatic deletion of the IKZF3 gene and
a somatic TP53 mutation. Three cases of pediatric B-ALL with mLH, two with TP53
mutations and one untested, were also identified and compared with the adult
patient.
CONCLUSIONS: CGAT was critical in the genotype clarification of these cases
through detection of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity and should be considered
performing for B-ALL with apparent hyperdiploidy for accurate prognostic risk
stratification and treatment planning.

Immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide
exhibit high responsive rates for newly identified or relapsed multiple myeloma
patients. However, their mechanisms of action are not completely understood. One 
mechanism involves the ubiquitination and degradation of two transcription
factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3. Whether there are other degradation pathways for IKZF1 
in myeloma cells remains unknown. Here, we found that although IKZF1
ubiquitination was reduced, its stability was also significantly reduced in MM1.S
and OPM2 cells treated with kinase inhibitors, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside
(DRB) or roscovitine. Through pharmacological inhibition and biochemical
approaches we demonstrated that instead of undergoing the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway, IKZF1 was degraded through apoptosis induced by kinase inhibition. This 
result may provide a new direction in developing therapeutic treatments for
myeloma patients.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
localized predominantly in body cavities. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes
virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of PEL. PEL is an incurable malignancy and
has extremely poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy.
Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lenalidomide and pomalidomide are Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of various ailments. IMiDs
display pronounced antiproliferative effect against majority of PEL cell lines
within their clinically achievable concentrations, by arresting cells at G0/G1
phase of cell cycle and without any induction of KSHV lytic cycle reactivation.
Although microarray examination of PEL cells treated with lenalidomide revealed
activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, blocking the IFN pathway did not block 
the anti-PEL activity of IMiDs. The anti-PEL effects of IMiDs involved
cereblon-dependent suppression of IRF4 and rapid degradation of IKZF1, but not
IKZF3. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYC enhanced the cytotoxicity of
IMiDs. Bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic 
readers, which perform a vital role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional
regulation. BRD4, a widely expressed transcriptional coactivator, belongs to the 
BET family of proteins, which has been shown to co-occupy the super enhancers
associated with MYC. Specific BRD4 inhibitors were developed, which suppress MYC 
transcriptionally. Lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with several
structurally distinct BRD4 inhibitors (JQ-1, IBET151 and PFI-1). Furthermore,
combined administration of lenalidomide and BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 significantly
increased the survival of PEL bearing NOD-SCID mice in an orthotopic xenograft
model as compared with either agent alone. These results provide compelling
evidence for clinical testing of IMiDs alone and in combination with BRD4
inhibitors for PEL.Oncogene advance online publication, 29 June 2015;

Human CRBN (cereblon) gene is located on chromosome 3 at 3p26 and its encoding
protein is a member of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (composed of CRBN, DDB1, CUL4A
and ROC1). The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome 
protein degradation pathway and attaches polyubiquitin chains to substrate
proteins for degradation via the protease complex. Currently, there are no
standardized assays for CRBN gene and protein measurement although quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry
and Western blot are widely used. CRBN has been identified as a direct target for
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) and plays a significant role in anti-proliferation,
pro-apoptotic effects, anti-angiogenic activities, immunomodulatory activities
and intervention of cell surface adhesion molecules between myeloma cells and
bone marrow stromal cells. Recently, clinical data show that majority of the
multiple myeloma patients treated with IMiD develop drug-resistance over time by 
unknown mechanisms. Fortunately, various in vivo and in vitro studies have
revealed that the decreased CRBN expression or CRBN deletion is associated with
resistance to IMiD in treating multiple myeloma, and CRBN expression levels may
have a prognostic significance. Furthermore, the most recently discovered protein
IKZF1, IKZF3, IRF4, C/EBPß and Wnt/catenin signaling pathways may also be closely
related to IMiD resistance in myeloma.

Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex, is the target of the immunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and
pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of these drugs to CRBN
promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of 2 common substrates,
transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that CC-122, a new
chemical entity termed pleiotropic pathway modifier, binds CRBN and promotes
degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T
cells in vitro, in vivo, and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as
well as immunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced
degradation or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Aiolos and Ikaros
correlates with increased transcription of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes
independent of IFN-a, -ß, and -<U+03B3> production and/or secretion and results in
apoptosis in both activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell DLBCL cell
lines. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the cell-of-origin
independent antilymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrast to the ABC subtype
selective activity of lenalidomide.

BACKGROUND: Overall, HER2-amplified female breast cancer (FBC) is associated with
a high grade, an aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. In male breast cancer
(MBC) amplification of HER2, located on chromosome 17, occurs at a lower
frequency than in FBC, where it is part of complex rearrangements. So far, only
few studies have addressed the occurrence of chromosome 17 alterations in small
MBC cohorts.
METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect and characterize copy number
changes on chromosome 17 in a cohort of 139 MBC. The results obtained were
compared to those in FBC, and were correlated with clinicopathological features
and patient outcome data.
RESULTS: We observed a lower frequency of chromosome 17 copy number changes with 
less complex rearrangement patterns in MBC compared to FBC. Chromosome 17 changes
in MBC included gains of 17q and losses of 17p. Whole chromosome 17 polyploidies 
were not encountered. Two recurrent chromosome 17 amplicons were detected: on
17q12 (encompassing the NEUROD2, HER2, GRB7 and IKZF3 gens) and on 17q23.1
(encompassing the MIR21 and RPS6KB1 genes). Whole arm copy number gains of 17q
were associated with decreased 5 year survival rates (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.010). Amplification
of HER2 was associated with a high tumor grade, but did not predict patient
survival. Although copy number gains of HER2 and NEUROD2 were associated with a
high tumor grade, a high mitotic count and a decreased 5 year survival rate
(p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015), only tumor size and NEUROD2 copy number gains emerged as independent
prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In MBC chromosome 17 shows less complex rearrangements and fewer
copy number changes compared to FBC. Frequent gains of 17q, encompassing two
distinct amplicons, and losses of 17p were observed, but no whole chromosome 17
polyploidies. Only NEUROD2 gains seem to have an independent prognostic impact.
These results suggest different roles of chromosome 17 aberrations in male versus
female breast carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies enabled us to discover a large number
of variants and genomic loci contributing to cardiovascular and metabolic
disorders. However, because the vast majority of the identified variants are
thought to merely be proxies for other functional variants, the causal mechanisms
remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that the part of the functional variants
involved in deregulating cardiometabolic genes is located in microRNA
(miRNA)-binding sites.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the largest genome-wide association studies available 
on glycemic indices, lipid traits, anthropometric measures, blood pressure,
coronary artery diseases, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, we identified 11,067
variants that are associated with cardiometabolic phenotypes. Of these, 230
variants are located within miRNA-binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region of 
155 cardiometabolic genes. Thirty-seven of 230 variants were found to fulfill our
predefined criteria for being functional in their genomic loci. Ten variants were
subsequently selected for experimental validation based on genome-wide
association studies results, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, 
and coexpression of their host genes and regulatory miRNAs in relevant tissues.
Luciferase reporter assays revealed an allele-specific regulation of genes
hosting the variants by miRNAs. These cotransfection experiments showed that
rs174545 (FADS1:miR-181a-2), rs1059611 (LPL:miR-136), rs13702 (LPL:miR-410),
rs1046875 (FN3KRP:miR-34a), rs7956 (MKRN2:miR-154), rs3217992
(CDKN2B:miR-138-2-3p), and rs11735092 (HSD17B13:miR-375) decrease or abrogate
miRNA-dependent regulation of the genes. Conversely, 2 variants, rs6857
(PVRL2:miR-320e) and rs907091 (IKZF3:miR-326), were shown to enhance the activity
of miRNAs on their host genes.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for a model in which polymorphisms in
miRNA-binding sites can both positively and negatively affect miRNA-mediated
regulation of cardiometabolic genes.

Lenalidomide and its analogs, thalidomide and pomalidomide, specifically inhibit 
growth of mature B-cell lymphomas, including multiple myeloma, and induce
interleukin-2 (IL-2) release from T cells. We recently found that this results
from activation of the CRBN-CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade the lymphoid
transcription factors IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos).

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Aiolos
in the regulation of B-cell leukaemia. A lentiviral system was used for
overexpression of the Aiolos gene in Nalm-6 cells to determine the effects of
Aiolos on proliferation, apoptosis and the cell cycle. The expression and
activation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and
Akt were also investigated. Upregulation of Aiolos inhibited cell growth and
arrested an increased number of Nalm-6 cells at the G0/G1 phase. The apoptotic
cell quantities were also significantly lower in the Aiolos-transfected Nalm-6
cells. In addition, Aiolos overexpression downregulated PTEN, but increased the
expression and phosphorylation of Akt in the Nalm-6 cells. The Akt inhibitor,
Akti-1/2, reduced the percentage of viable Aiolos-overexpressed Nalm-6 cells,
however, it had no effect on cell cycle arrest or proliferation. Aiolos
upregulation in the Nalm-6 cells inhibited cell proliferation, suppressed
apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Aiolos improved the
survival of Nalm-6 cells via PTEN- and Akt-dependent processes.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive neoplastic disorder 
of immature hematopoietic precursors committed to T-cell lineage. T-ALL accounts 
for ~15% of pediatric ALL cases and is prone to early relapse. With new and
improved treatment protocols, the prognosis of T-ALL has improved particularly in
children; however, the outcome of relapsed T-ALL cases remains poor. The AIOLOS
gene is necessary to control lymphocyte differentiation and may be a potential
target of T-ALL therapy. In the present study, Jurkat cells were divided into
three groups: untransfected (UT) control, lentiviral vector control (Lenti-Mock) 
and AIOLOS-overexpressing (Lenti-AIOLOS) groups. Lenti-AIOLOS Jurkat cells were
constructed by lentiviral transduction; cell cycle analysis, apoptosis and
cytotoxicity assays were then performed to evaluate the effects of AIOLOS on cell
cycle distribution, apoptosis and cell chemosensitivity to etoposide of Jurkat
cells in vitro. Moreover, the expression levels of genes associated with
apoptosis and cell cycle were investigated by quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that the percentage of
Jurkat cells in the G0/G1 phase increased from 71.5 (UT) to 85.4% (Lenti-AIOLOS; 
P<0.05), yet the percentage of cells in the S-phase decreased from 15.1 (UT) to
11.6% (Lenti-AIOLOS; P<0.05). The percentage of total apoptotic cells was
significantly increased in the AIOLOS-transfected Jurkat cells (21.93%) compared 
with this percentage in the Lenti-Mock (13.35%) or the UT group (13.30%; P<0.05).
Consistent with these results, AIOLOS overexpression induced P21 and P27
upregulation and CCND3 and SKP2 downregulation. Furthermore, AIOLOS
overexpression synergistically increased the cytotoxic effects of etoposide and
downregulated NF-<U+03BA>B expression. Our findings revealed that lentivirus-mediated
AIOLOS overexpression in Jurkat cells induced cell apoptosis, arrested the cell
cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and synergistically increased the sensitivity of Jurkat
cells to etoposide by inhibiting NF-<U+03BA>B activity.

IL4I1 encodes an L-phenylalanine oxidase that inhibits T-cell proliferation. It
has been recently reported that IL4I1 is expressed in TH17 cells as part of a
mechanism that limits their pathogenicity. We have previously identified a
population of human FOXP3(+) Treg cells that secrete IL-17 ex vivo; here, we
addressed the expression of IL4I1 in that Treg-cell population. We found that in 
ex vivo isolated circulating Treg cells, IL4I1 expression is induced by
activation. Moreover, IL4I1 expression is restricted to cells that do not express
Helios, a transcription factor that characterizes natural Treg cells, but that
express Aiolos, which is involved in the differentiation of TH17 and induced Treg
cells. We also showed that conversion of Treg cells under inflammatory conditions
increases IL4I1 expression, likely as part of a regulatory loop that attempts to 
limit the pathogenicity resulting from their conversion into TH17. The specific
expression of IL4I1 in TH17 and iTreg cells may provide insights into approaches 
that aim at modulating these populations in different pathological conditions
involving inflammation-mediated immunosuppression.

Natural killer (NK) cells are an innate lymphoid cell lineage characterized by
their capacity to provide rapid effector functions, including cytokine production
and cytotoxicity. Here, we identify the Ikaros family member, Aiolos, as a
regulator of NK-cell maturation. Aiolos expression is initiated at the point of
lineage commitment and maintained throughout NK-cell ontogeny. Analysis of cell
surface markers representative of distinct stages of peripheral NK-cell
maturation revealed that Aiolos was required for the maturation in the spleen of 
CD11b(high)CD27(-) NK cells. The differentiation block was intrinsic to the
NK-cell lineage and resembled that found in mice lacking either T-bet or Blimp1; 
however, genetic analysis revealed that Aiolos acted independently of all other
known regulators of NK-cell differentiation. NK cells lacking Aiolos were
strongly hyper-reactive to a variety of NK-cell-mediated tumor models, yet
impaired in controlling viral infection, suggesting a regulatory function for
CD27(-) NK cells in balancing these two arms of the immune response. These data
place Aiolos in the emerging gene regulatory network controlling NK-cell
maturation and function.

OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that IKAROS family of zinc finger 3
(IKZF3)-deficient mice spontaneously develop human systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE)-like phenotypes and produce anti-dsDNA Ab leading to immune
complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Polymorphism of the IKZF3 gene corresponds
with the susceptibility to several immune-related diseases. Our intention was to 
establish an association between polymorphisms in the IKZF3 gene and SLE in the
Chinese Han population.
METHODS: The study involved obtaining blood samples for DNA extraction and
genotyping the 4 selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IKZF3,
including rs12150079, rs9909593, rs907091, and rs2872507, by performing PCR
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). A group of 366 SLE 
patients were compared to 455 healthy controls.
RESULTS: A significant decrease in frequencies of the rs907091 CC genotype and C 
allele appeared in the SLE patients unlike that observed in the controls (p =
0.001 and 0.015, respectively). The frequencies of the rs12150079 genotype and
allele were different between the SLE patients and the control individuals,
although the significance was only marginal (p = 0.046 and 0.049, respectively). 
In addition, a significantly low frequency of the GGCG haplotype was observed in 
the SLE patients, suggesting that it may provide protection against SLE (p =
0.011).
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate 
an important association between polymorphisms in IKZF3 and SLE in the Chinese
Han population. A strong association between rs907091 in the IKZF3 gene and SLE
was identified.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSDMB (Gasdermin B) and ORMDL3 (ORMDL
sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3) are strongly associated with childhood
asthma, but the molecular alterations contributing to disease remain unknown. We 
investigated the effects of asthma-associated SNPs on DNA methylation and mRNA
levels of GSDMB and ORMDL3. Genetic association between GSDMB/ORMDL3 and
physician-diagnosed childhood asthma was confirmed in the Swedish birth-cohort
BAMSE. CpG-site SNPs (rs7216389 and rs4065275) showed differences in DNA
methylation depending on carrier status of the risk alleles, and were
significantly associated with methylation levels in two CpG sites in the 5' UTR
(untranslated region) of ORMDL3. In the Swedish Search study, we found
significant differences in DNA methylation between asthmatics and controls in
five CpG sites; after adjusting for lymphocyte and neutrophil cell counts, three 
remained significant: one in IKZF3 [IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos);
cg16293631] and two in the CpG island (CGI) of ORMDL3 (cg02305874 and
cg16638648). Also, cg16293631 and cg02305874 correlated with mRNA levels of
ORMDL3. The association between methylation and asthma was independent of the
genotype in rs7216389, rs4065275 and rs12603332. Both SNPs and CpG sites showed
significant associations with ORMDL3 mRNA levels. SNPs influenced expression
independently of methylation, and the residual association between methylation
and expression was not mediated by these SNPs. We found a differentially
methylated region in the CGI shore of ORMDL3 with six CpG sites less methylated
in CD8(+) T-cells. In summary, this study supports that there are differences in 
DNA methylation at this locus between asthmatics and controls; and both SNPs and 
CpG sites are independently associated with ORMDL3 expression.

MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci
implicated in disease susceptibility. Integration of GWAS summary statistics
(P-values) and functional genomic datasets should help to elucidate mechanisms.
RESULTS: We extended a non-parametric SNP set enrichment method to test for
enrichment of GWAS signals in functionally defined loci to a situation where only
GWAS P-values are available. The approach is implemented in VSEAMS, a freely
available software pipeline. We use VSEAMS to identify enrichment of type 1
diabetes (T1D) GWAS associations near genes that are targets for the
transcription factors IKZF3, BATF and ESRRA. IKZF3 lies in a known T1D
susceptibility region, while BATF and ESRRA overlap other immune disease
susceptibility regions, validating our approach and suggesting novel avenues of
research for T1D.

The evolving tale of immunomodulatory drugs and cereblon.

Holstein SA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.

The immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), of which thalidomide was the first in class, 
have had a complex therapeutic history. Although these drugs are now widely used 
to treat multiple myeloma, the precise molecular mechanism of action of these
agents has remained elusive. The finding that IMiDs bind cereblon, with
subsequent activation of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and degradation of the key 
transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3, has provided insight into these drugs but 
leaves many questions unanswered.

The Cul4-Rbx1-DDB1-Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is the target of
thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, therapeutically important drugs for
multiple myeloma and other B-cell malignancies. These drugs directly bind
Cereblon (CRBN) and promote the recruitment of substrates Ikaros (IKZF1) and
Aiolos (IKZF3) to the E3 complex, thus leading to substrate ubiquitination and
degradation. Here we present the crystal structure of human CRBN bound to DDB1
and the drug lenalidomide. A hydrophobic pocket in the thalidomide-binding domain
(TBD) of CRBN accommodates the glutarimide moiety of lenalidomide, whereas the
isoindolinone ring is exposed to solvent. We also solved the structures of the
mouse TBD in the apo state and with thalidomide or pomalidomide. Site-directed
mutagenesis in lentiviral-expression myeloma models showed that key drug-binding 
residues are critical for antiproliferative effects.

The development of resistance to therapy is unavoidable in the history of
multiple myeloma patients. Therefore, the study of its characteristics and
mechanisms is critical in the search for novel therapeutic approaches to overcome
it. This effort is hampered by the absence of appropriate preclinical models,
especially those mimicking acquired resistance. Here we present an in vivo model 
of acquired resistance based on the continuous treatment of mice bearing
subcutaneous MM1S plasmacytomas. Xenografts acquired resistance to two
generations of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs; lenalidomide and pomalidomide) in
combination with dexamethasone, that was reversible after a wash-out period.
Furthermore, lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LD) or pomalidomide-dexamethasone (PD)
did not display cross-resistance, which could be due to the differential
requirements of the key target Cereblon and its substrates Aiolos and Ikaros
observed in cells resistant to each combination. Differential gene expression
profiles of LD and PD could also explain the absence of cross-resistance. Onset
of resistance to both combinations was accompanied by upregulation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway and addition of selumetinib, a small-molecule MEK
inhibitor, could resensitize resistant cells. Our results provide insights into
the mechanisms of acquired resistance to LD and PD combinations and offer
possible therapeutic approaches to addressing IMiD resistance in the clinic.

Roquin-1, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions as a modulator of
inflammation; however, nothing is known about how Rc3h1 expression is regulated. 
Here, we describe an opposing relationship between Roquin-1 and the IL-17
proinflammatory cytokine by demonstrating that enforced expression of Rc3h1
restricts Il17a expression, and that exposure of T cells to IL-10, a cytokine
with immunosuppressive activity, increases Rc3h1 expression. Luciferase reporter 
assays conducted using eight transcription factor plasmids (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, 
GATA2, c-Rel, IKZF1, IKZF2, and IKZF3) demonstrated that STAT1, STAT3, GATA2, and
c-Rel increased Rc3h1 promoter activity, whereas IKZF2 decreased activity. Gene
expression of those five transcription factors increased in T cells exposed to
IL-10. Transcription factor-specific siRNAs suppressed the IL-10 effect on Rc3h1 
transcription. These findings identify a role for IL-10 in regulating Rc3h1
transcription, and they have implications for understanding how Roquin-1 controls
the immune response.

In the 1950s, the drug thalidomide, administered as a sedative to pregnant women,
led to the birth of thousands of children with multiple defects. Despite the
teratogenicity of thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and pomalidomide, 
these immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) recently emerged as effective treatments for
multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion-associated dysplasia. IMiDs target the E3
ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)) and promote the
ubiquitination of the IKAROS family transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 by
CRL4(CRBN). Here we present crystal structures of the DDB1-CRBN complex bound to 
thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide. The structure establishes that CRBN
is a substrate receptor within CRL4(CRBN) and enantioselectively binds IMiDs.
Using an unbiased screen, we identified the homeobox transcription factor MEIS2
as an endogenous substrate of CRL4(CRBN). Our studies suggest that IMiDs block
endogenous substrates (MEIS2) from binding to CRL4(CRBN) while the ligase complex
is recruiting IKZF1 or IKZF3 for degradation. This dual activity implies that
small molecules can modulate an E3 ubiquitin ligase and thereby upregulate or
downregulate the ubiquitination of proteins.

In a previous large-scale exome sequencing analysis for psoriasis, we discovered 
seven common and low-frequency missense variants within six genes with
genome-wide significance. Here we describe an in-depth analysis of noncoding
variants based on sequencing data (10,727 cases and 10,582 controls) with
replication in an independent cohort of Han Chinese individuals consisting of
4,480 cases and 6,521 controls to identify additional psoriasis susceptibility
loci. We confirmed four known psoriasis susceptibility loci (IL12B, IFIH1, ERAP1 
and RNF114; 2.30 × 10(-20)=P=2.41 × 10(-7)) and identified three new
susceptibility loci: 4q24 (NFKB1) at rs1020760 (P=2.19 × 10(-8)), 12p13.3
(CD27-LAG3) at rs758739 (P=4.08 × 10(-8)) and 17q12 (IKZF3) at rs10852936 (P=1.96
× 10(-8)). Two suggestive loci, 3p21.31 and 17q25, are also identified with
P<1.00 × 10(-6). The results of this study increase the number of confirmed
psoriasis risk loci and provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

Cereblon (CRBN) mediates immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) action in multiple myeloma 
(MM). Using 2 different methodologies, we identified 244 CRBN binding proteins
and established relevance to MM biology by changes in their abundance after
exposure to lenalidomide. Proteins most reproducibly binding CRBN (>fourfold vs
controls) included DDB1, CUL4A, IKZF1, KPNA2, LTF, PFKL, PRKAR2A, RANGAP1, and
SHMT2. After lenalidomide treatment, the abundance of 46 CRBN binding proteins
decreased. We focused attention on 2 of these-IKZF1 and IKZF3. IZKF expression is
similar across all MM stages or subtypes; however, IKZF1 is substantially lower
in 3 of 5 IMiD-resistant MM cell lines. The cell line (FR4) with the lowest IKZF1
levels also harbors a damaging mutation and a translocation that upregulates
IRF4, an IKZF target. Clinical relevance of CRBN-binding proteins was
demonstrated in 44 refractory MM patients treated with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone therapy in whom low IKZF1 gene expression predicted lack of
response (0/11 responses in the lowest expression quartile). CRBN, IKZF1, and
KPNA2 levels also correlate with significant differences in overall survival. Our
study identifies CRBN-binding proteins and demonstrates that in addition to CRBN,
IKZF1, and KPNA2, expression can predict survival outcomes.

New mechanism of lenalidomide activity.

Keevan J(1), Figg WD(1).

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Pharmacology Program; National Cancer Institute; Bethesda, MD USA.

Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) that has activity in hematologic
cancer (e.g., multiple myeloma). The immunomodulatory and apoptotic properties
are readily apparent in therapy. However, the exact mechanism of action has been 
difficult to quantify until recently when it was shown that another IMiD,
thalidomide, binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex constituent, CRBN. The
article by Kronke et al. demonstrates that, by binding to CRBN and altering its
selectivity, lenalidomide potentiates the ubiquitination and proteolysis of 2
specific proteins, IKZF1 and IKZF3. An article in the same issue, by Lu et al.,
supports these observations. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are transcription factors that are
necessary for multiple myeloma, and repression of these transcription factors is 
a likely mechanism for lenalidomide activity in this disease.

Comment in
    Cancer Cell. 2014 May 12;25(5):551-2.

Anchorage of tissue cells to their physical environment is an obligate
requirement for survival that is lost in mature hematopoietic and in transformed 
epithelial cells. Here we find that a lymphocyte lineage-restricted transcription
factor, Aiolos, is frequently expressed in lung cancers and predicts markedly
reduced patient survival. Aiolos decreases expression of a large set of
adhesion-related genes, disrupting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Aiolos
also reconfigures chromatin structure within the SHC1 gene, causing
isoform-specific silencing of the anchorage reporter p66(Shc) and blocking
anoikis in vitro and in vivo. In lung cancer tissues and single cells, p66(Shc)
expression inversely correlates with that of Aiolos. Together, these findings
suggest that Aiolos functions as an epigenetic driver of lymphocyte mimicry in
metastatic epithelial cancers.

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Li and colleagues demonstrate that the
hematopoietic transcription factor Aiolos (named after the Wind God of Greek
mythology) confers anoikis resistance in lung tumor cells through repression of
cell adhesion-related genes including the mechanosensor p66Shc.

IL-17+ CD4+ T (Th17) cells contribute to the pathogenesis of several human
inflammatory diseases. Here we demonstrate that TNF inhibitor (TNFi) drugs induce
the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in CD4+ T cells including IL-17+ CD4+ T
cells. TNFi-mediated induction of IL-10 in IL-17+ CD4+ T cells is
Treg-/Foxp3-independent, requires IL-10 and is overcome by IL-1ß. TNFi-exposed
IL-17+ CD4+ T cells are molecularly and functionally distinct, with a unique gene
signature characterized by expression of IL10 and IKZF3 (encoding Aiolos). We
show that Aiolos binds conserved regions in the IL10 locus in IL-17+ CD4+ T
cells. Furthermore, IKZF3 and IL10 expression levels correlate in primary CD4+ T 
cells and Aiolos overexpression is sufficient to drive IL10 in these cells. Our
data demonstrate that TNF-a blockade induces IL-10 in CD4+ T cells including Th17
cells and suggest a role for the transcription factor Aiolos in the regulation of
IL-10 in CD4+ T cells.

Thalidomide and related drugs are key drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma
(MM). These agents bind to cereblon, a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex,
altering the specificity of the complex to induce the ubiquitylation and
degradation of Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), transcription factors essential
for MM growth.

C/EBPa-mediated activation of microRNAs 34a and 223 inhibits Lef1 expression to
achieve efficient reprogramming into macrophages.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exert negative effects on gene expression and influence cell
lineage choice during hematopoiesis. C/EBPa-induced pre-B cell-to-macrophage
transdifferentiation provides an excellent model to investigate the contribution 
of miRNAs to hematopoietic cell identity, especially because the two cell types
involved fall into separate lymphoid and myeloid branches. In this process,
efficient repression of the B cell-specific program is essential to ensure
transdifferentation and macrophage function. miRNA profiling revealed that
upregulation of miRNAs is highly predominant compared with downregulation and
that C/EBPa directly regulates several upregulated miRNAs. We also determined
that miRNA 34a (miR-34a) and miR-223 sharply accelerate C/EBPa-mediated
transdifferentiation, whereas their depletion delays this process. These two
miRNAs affect the transdifferentiation efficiency and activity of macrophages,
including their lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent inflammatory response. miR-34a
and miR-223 directly target and downregulate the lymphoid transcription factor
Lef1, whose ectopic expression delays transdifferentiation to an extent similar
to that seen with miR-34a and miR-223 depletion. In addition, ectopic
introduction of Lef1 in macrophages causes upregulation of B cell markers,
including CD19, Pax5, and Ikzf3. Our report demonstrates the importance of these 
miRNAs in ensuring the erasure of key B cell transcription factors, such as Lef1,
and reinforces the notion of their essential role in fine-tuning the control
required for establishing cell identity.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental
causes. Genome-wide association studies of asthma have mostly involved European
populations, and replication of positive associations has been inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify asthma-associated genes in a large Latino
population with genome-wide association analysis and admixture mapping.
METHODS: Latino children with asthma (n = 1893) and healthy control subjects (n =
1881) were recruited from 5 sites in the United States: Puerto Rico, New York,
Chicago, Houston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Subjects were genotyped on an
Affymetrix World Array IV chip. We performed genome-wide association and
admixture mapping to identify asthma-associated loci.
RESULTS: We identified a significant association between ancestry and asthma at
6p21 (lowest P value: rs2523924, P < 5 × 10(-6)). This association replicates in 
a meta-analysis of the EVE Asthma Consortium (P = .01). Fine mapping of the
region in this study and the EVE Asthma Consortium suggests an association
between PSORS1C1 and asthma. We confirmed the strong allelic association between 
SNPs in the 17q21 region and asthma in Latinos (IKZF3, lowest P value: rs90792,
odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61-0.75; P = 6 × 10(-13)) and replicated associations
in several genes that had previously been associated with asthma in genome-wide
association studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Admixture mapping and genome-wide association are complementary
techniques that provide evidence for multiple asthma-associated loci in Latinos. 
Admixture mapping identifies a novel locus on 6p21 that replicates in a
meta-analysis of several Latino populations, whereas genome-wide association
confirms the previously identified locus on 17q21.

Nalm-6 cells.

The AIOLOS gene is important in the control of mature B-lymphocyte
differentiation and proliferation. Previous research has shown that deregulated
AIOLOS expression is associated with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in human patients. However, the function
of AIOLOS in childhood B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL is not fully understood. In the
present study, Nalm-6 cells were divided into three groups: the untransfected
control (UT), the lentiviral vector control (Lenti-Mock) and the
AIOLOS-overexpressing (Lenti-AIOLOS) group. Lenti-AIOLOS Nalm-6 cells were
constructed by lentiviral transduction, followed by cell proliferation assay,
cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis assay, to evaluate the effects of AIOLOS on
proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells in vitro.
Moreover, the expression levels of genes associated with apoptosis and the cell
cycle, as well as the transcription factors IKZF1 and NF-<U+03BA>B, were investigated by
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot
analysis. The results showed that the proliferation of Nalm-6 cells in the
Lenti-AIOLOS group was reduced by 16% on day 8 compared with cells in the UT
group (P>0.05). The reduction peaked at 29% on day 10 (P<0.05). The percentage of
Nalm-6 cells in the G0/G1 phase increased from 70.4 (UT) to 84.1% (Lenti-AIOLOS) 
(P<0.01), and the S-phase cells decreased from 20.3 (UT) to 11.7% (Lenti-AIOLOS) 
(P<0.01). Total apoptotic cells significantly decreased in AIOLOS-transfected
Nalm-6 cells (10.75%) compared with those in the Lenti-Mock (17.00%) or UT group 
(19.05%) (P<0.01). In particular, the difference between the groups in the
percentage of late apoptotic cells was significant (2.85 vs. 7.95%; P<0.01). In
addition, overexpression of AIOLOS resulted in upregulation of BCL-2 and
downregulation of CCND3, BAX, IKZF1 and NF-<U+03BA>B. No changes were detected on C-MYC 
and P27. Our findings indicate that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of AIOLOS 
in Nalm-6 cells could inhibit cell proliferation, suppress cell apoptosis and
arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in vitro.

Immunomodulatory agents lenalidomide and pomalidomide co-stimulate T cells by
inducing degradation of T cell repressors Ikaros and Aiolos via modulation of the
E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4(CRBN.).

Cereblon (CRBN), the molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, is a
substrate receptor of the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4(CRBN) . T
cell co-stimulation by lenalidomide or pomalidomide is cereblon dependent:
however, the CRL4(CRBN) substrates responsible for T cell co-stimulation have yet
to be identified. Here we demonstrate that interaction of the transcription
factors Ikaros (IKZF1, encoded by the IKZF1 gene) and Aiolos (IKZF3, encoded by
the IKZF3 gene) with CRL4(CRBN) is induced by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Each 
agent promotes Aiolos and Ikaros binding to CRL4(CRBN) with enhanced
ubiquitination leading to cereblon-dependent proteosomal degradation in T
lymphocytes. We confirm that Aiolos and Ikaros are transcriptional repressors of 
interleukin-2 expression. The findings link lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-induced
degradation of these transcriptional suppressors to well documented T cell
activation. Importantly, Aiolos could serve as a proximal pharmacodynamic marker 
for lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as healthy human subjects administered
lenalidomide demonstrated Aiolos degradation in their peripheral T cells. In
conclusion, we present a molecular model in which drug binding to cereblon
results in the interaction of Ikaros and Aiolos to CRL4(CRBN) , leading to their 
ubiquitination, subsequent proteasomal degradation and T cell activation.

Lenalidomide is a drug with clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma and other B
cell neoplasms, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Using quantitative
proteomics, we found that lenalidomide causes selective ubiquitination and
degradation of two lymphoid transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3, by the
CRBN-CRL4 ubiquitin ligase. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are essential transcription factors
in multiple myeloma. A single amino acid substitution of IKZF3 conferred
resistance to lenalidomide-induced degradation and rescued lenalidomide-induced
inhibition of cell growth. Similarly, we found that lenalidomide-induced
interleukin-2 production in T cells is due to depletion of IKZF1 and IKZF3. These
findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of action for a therapeutic agent:
alteration of the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to selective
degradation of specific targets.

Thalidomide-like drugs such as lenalidomide are clinically important treatments
for multiple myeloma and show promise for other B cell malignancies. The
biochemical mechanisms underlying their antitumor activity are unknown.
Thalidomide was recently shown to bind to, and inhibit, the cereblon ubiquitin
ligase. Cereblon loss in zebrafish causes fin defects reminiscent of the limb
defects seen in children exposed to thalidomide in utero. Here we show that
lenalidomide-bound cereblon acquires the ability to target for proteasomal
degradation two specific B cell transcription factors, Ikaros family zinc finger 
proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3). Analysis of myeloma cell lines revealed that 
loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 is both necessary and sufficient for lenalidomide's
therapeutic effect, suggesting that the antitumor and teratogenic activities of
thalidomide-like drugs are dissociable.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether risk of gastric cancer (GC) 
was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene cluster on
the chromosome 17q12-q21 (ERBB2 amplicon) in the Chinese Han population. We
detected twenty-six SNPs in this gene cluster containing steroidogenic acute
regulatory-related lipid transfer domain containing 3 (STARD3), protein
phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B (PPP1R1B/DARPP32), titin-cap (TCAP),
per1-like domain containing 1(PERLD1/CAB2), human epidermal growth factor
receptor-2 (ERBB2/HER2), zinc-finger protein subfamily 1A 3 (ZNFN1A3/IKZF3) and
DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) genes in 311 patients with GC and in 425
controls by Sequenom. We found no associations between genetic variations and GC 
risk. However, haplotype analysis implied that the haplotype CCCT of STARD3
(rs9972882, rs881844, rs11869286 and rs1877031) conferred a protective effect on 
the susceptibility to GC (P=0.043, odds ratio [OR]=0.805, 95% confidence
intervals [95% CI]=0.643-0.992). The STARD3 rs1877031 TC genotype endued
histogenesis of gastric mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma
(P=0.021, OR=2.882, 95% CI=1.173-7.084). We examined the expression of STARD3 in 
243 tumor tissues out of the 311 GC patients and 20 adjacent normal gastric
tissues using immumohistochemical (IHC) analysis and tissue microarrays (TMA).
The expression of STARD3 was observed in the gastric parietal cells and in
gastric tumor tissues and significantly correlated with gender (P=0.004), alcohol
drinking (P<0.001), tumor location (P=0.007), histological type (P=0.005) and
differentiation (P=0.023) in GC. We concluded that the combined effect of
haplotype CCCT of STARD3 might affect GC susceptibility. STARD3 expression might 
be related to the tumorigenesis of GC in the Chinese population.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether orosomucoid like 3 (ORMDL3)
and 17q21 variants are associated with susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis
(AS) in a Chinese population.
METHOD: A total of 753 unrelated AS patients and 1120 ethnically matched healthy 
controls were recruited. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs7216389, 
rs12603332, rs12936231, rs9303277, rs11557467, rs1007654, and rs17608925), which 
were selected from chromosome 17q21 containing the genes ORMDL3, GSDMB, ZPBP2,
and IKZF3, were genotyped by the Taqman SNP genotyping assay.
RESULTS: Five of the SNPs (rs7216389, rs12603332, rs12936231, rs9303277, and
rs11557467) were associated with AS (all p = 0.01), especially in males (all p < 
0.001). Of these, rs7216389, rs12603332, rs12936231, and rs11557467 were strongly
associated with severity of the disease based on radiographic findings (p <
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that variants in chromosome 17q21 are
significantly associated with AS in a Chinese Han population.

Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ) has recently emerged as a potential
therapeutic target in various malignant tumors because it plays vital roles in
cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and
genomic stability. Therefore, there is a significant interest in discovering its 
function in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Firstly, OAZ1 mRNA was measured by
qRT-PCR in 43 cases with CML and 23 controls, and we demonstrated that it is
significantly down-regulated in CML patients. To further understand its functions
in CML pathogenesis, OAZ1 was overexpressed, and the human leukemia PCR array
analysis was used to monitor the expression of key genes commonly involved in
leukemia development, classification and therapeutic response. We found several
favorable up-regulation factors including CXCL10, DAPK1 and IKZF3. In conclusion,
OAZ1 may be a useful therapeutic target in CML due to its potential ability to
induce erythroid differentiation and cell apoptosis. These functions were proven 
to be associated with several gene changes that were directly or indirectly
caused by OAZ1. The mechanism of how OAZ1 affects other genes remains to be
elucidated.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a very rare disease that 
currently lacks genomic and genetic biomarkers to assist in its clinical
management. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of three BPDCN cases. Based
on these data, we designed a resequencing approach to identify mutations in 38
selected genes in 25 BPDCN samples. WES revealed 37-99 deleterious gene mutations
per exome with no common affected genes between patients, but with clear overlap 
in terms of molecular and disease pathways (hematological and dermatological
disease). We identified for the first time deleterious mutations in IKZF3, HOXB9,
UBE2G2 and ZEB2 in human leukemia. Target sequencing identified 29 recurring
genes, ranging in prevalence from 36% for previously known genes, such as TET2,
to 12-16% for newly identified genes, such as IKZF3 or ZEB2. Half of the tumors
had mutations affecting either the DNA methylation or chromatin remodeling
pathways. The clinical analysis revealed that patients with mutations in DNA
methylation pathway had a significantly reduced overall survival (P=0.047). We
provide the first mutational profiling of BPDCN. The data support the current WHO
classification of the disease as a myeloid disorder and provide a biological
rationale for the incorporation of epigenetic therapies for its treatment.

Human memory Helios- FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) encompass induced Tregs
that express Aiolos and respond to IL-1ß by downregulating their suppressor
functions.

FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical regulators of self-tolerance and
immune homeostasis. In mice and humans, two subsets of FOXP3(+) Tregs have been
defined based on their differential expression of Helios, a transcription factor 
of the Ikaros family. Whereas the origin, specificity, and differential function 
of the two subsets are as yet a source of controversy, their characterization
thus far has been limited by the absence of surface markers to distinguish them. 
In this article, we show that human memory Helios(+) and Helios(-) Tregs are
phenotypically distinct and can be separated ex vivo based on their differential 
expression of IL-1RI, which is restricted to Helios(-) Tregs, in combination with
CCR7. The two populations isolated using this strategy are distinct with respect 
to the expression of other Ikaros family members. Namely, whereas Eos, which has 
been reported to mediate FOXP3-dependent gene silencing, is expressed in
Helios(+) Tregs, Aiolos, which is involved in the differentiation of TH17 and
induced Tregs, is instead expressed in Helios(-) Tregs. In addition, whereas both
subsets are suppressive ex vivo, Helios(-) Tregs display increased suppressive
capacity in comparison to Helios(+) Tregs, but respond to IL-1ß by downregulating
their suppressive activity. Together, these data support the concept that human
Helios(-) memory Tregs encompass induced Tregs that can readily respond to
changes in the environment by modulating their suppressive capacity.

The t(12;21) chromosomal translocation, targeting the gene encoding the RUNX1
transcription factor, is observed in 25% of pediatric acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) and is an initiating event in the disease. To elucidate the
mechanism by which RUNX1 disruption initiates leukemogenesis, we investigated its
normal role in murine B-cell development. This study revealed 2 critical
functions of Runx1: (1) to promote survival and development of progenitors
specified to the B-cell lineage, a function that can be substituted by ectopic
Bcl2 expression, and (2) to enable the developmental transition through the pre-B
stage triggered by the pre-B-cell antigen receptor (pre-BCR). Gene expression
analysis and genomewide Runx1 occupancy studies support the hypothesis that Runx1
reinforces the transcription factor network governing early B-cell survival and
development and specifically regulates genes encoding members of the Lyn kinase
subfamily (key integrators of interleukin-7 and pre-BCR signaling) and the
stage-specific transcription factors SpiB and Aiolos (critical downstream
effectors of pre-BCR signaling). Interrogation of expression databases of 257 ALL
samples demonstrated the specific down-regulation of the SPIB and IKZF3 genes
(the latter encoding AIOLOS) in t(12;21) ALL, providing novel insight into the
mechanism by which the translocation blocks B-cell development and promotes
leukemia.

BACKGROUND: 17q12-21 polymorphisms are associated with asthma presence and
severity across different populations.
OBJECTIVE: To extensively investigate the genes in this region among Croatian
schoolchildren in a case-control study, taking account of early-life
environmental exposures.
METHODS: We included 423 children with asthma and 414 controls aged 5 to 18
years. Fifty-one haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
genotyped (GSDMA, GSDMB, ORMDL3, IKZF3, ZPBP2, and TOP2). Data on exposure to
smoking and furry pet ownership were collected using a validated questionnaire.
Information on severe asthma exacerbations with hospital admission were retrieved
from hospital notes. All patients underwent spirometry.
RESULTS: We found 2 SNPs (1 novel rs9635726 in IKZF3) to be associated with
asthma. Among children with asthma, 4 SNPs (in ZPBP2, GSDMB, and GSDMA) were
associated with hospital admissions and 8 SNPs with lung function. One SNP
(rs9635726) remained significantly associated with a predicted forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second after false discovery rate correction. Nine markers across 5
genes showed interaction with early-life environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
exposure in relation to asthma and 2 with furry pet ownership. Among children
with asthma, we observed significant interactions between early-life ETS exposure
and 3 SNPs for lung function and among early-life ETS exposure, 3 SNPs (in ORMDL3
and GSDMA), and hospital admission with asthma exacerbation. Three SNPs (in
ORMDL3) interacted with current furry pet ownership in relation to hospital
admissions for asthma exacerbation.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that several genes in the 17q12-21 region may be
associated with asthma. This study confirms that environmental exposures may need
to be included into the genetic association studies.

Molecular abnormalities involved in the multistep leukemogenesis of adult T-cell 
leukemia (ATL) remain to be clarified. Based on our integrated database, we
focused on the expression patterns and levels of Ikaros family genes, Ikaros,
Helios, and Aiolos, in ATL patients and HTLV-1 carriers. The results revealed
profound deregulation of Helios expression, a pivotal regulator in the control of
T-cell differentiation and activation. The majority of ATL samples (32/37 cases) 
showed abnormal splicing of Helios expression, and four cases did not express
Helios. In addition, novel genomic loss in Helios locus was observed in 17/168
cases. We identified four ATL-specific short Helios isoforms and revealed their
dominant-negative function. Ectopic expression of ATL-type Helios isoform as well
as knockdown of normal Helios or Ikaros promoted T-cell growth. Global mRNA
profiling and pathway analysis showed activation of several signaling pathways
important for lymphocyte proliferation and survival. These data provide new
insights into the molecular involvement of Helios function in the leukemogenesis 
and phenotype of ATL cells, indicating that Helios deregulation is one of the
novel molecular hallmarks of ATL.

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) controls the activation of a subset of
AGC kinases. Using a conditional knockout of PDK1 in haematopoietic cells, we
demonstrate that PDK1 is essential for B cell development. B-cell progenitors
lacking PDK1 arrested at the transition of pro-B to pre-B cells, due to a cell
autonomous defect. Loss of PDK1 decreased the expression of the IgH chain in
pro-B cells due to impaired recombination of the IgH distal variable segments, a 
process coordinated by the transcription factor Pax5. The expression of Pax5 in
pre-B cells was decreased in PDK1 knockouts, which correlated with reduced
expression of the Pax5 target genes IRF4, IRF8 and Aiolos. As a result, Ccnd3 is 
upregulated in PDK1 knockout pre-B cells and they have an impaired ability to
undergo cell-cycle arrest, a necessary event for Ig light chain rearrangement.
Instead, these cells underwent apoptosis that correlated with diminished
expression of the pro-survival gene Bcl2A1. Reintroduction of both Pax5 and
Bcl2A1 together into PDK1 knockout pro-B cells restored their ability to
differentiate in vitro into mature B cells.

The genetic basis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a subtype of
ALL characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome, is unknown. Genomic profiling
of 124 hypodiploid ALL cases, including whole-genome and exome sequencing of 40
cases, identified two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy,
transcriptional profiles and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near-haploid ALL
with 24-31 chromosomes harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling and Ras signaling (71%) and the lymphoid transcription factor gene
IKZF3 (encoding AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low-hypodiploid ALL with 32-39
chromosomes are characterized by alterations in TP53 (91.2%) that are commonly
present in nontumor cells, IKZF2 (encoding HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both
near-haploid and low-hypodiploid leukemic cells show activation of Ras-signaling 
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathways and are sensitive to PI3K
inhibitors, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic
strategy for this aggressive form of leukemia.

Ikaros family DNA-binding proteins are critical regulators of B-cell development.
Because the current knowledge of Ikaros targets in B-cell progenitors is limited,
we have identified genes that are bound and regulated by Ikaros in pre-B cells.
To elucidate the role of Ikaros in B-cell lineage specification and
differentiation, we analyzed the differential expression of Ikaros targets during
the progression of multipotent to lymphoid-restricted progenitors, B- and T-cell 
lineage specification, and progression along the B-cell lineage. Ikaros targets
accounted for one-half of all genes up-regulated during B-cell lineage
specification in vivo, explaining the essential role of Ikaros in this process.
Expression of the Ikaros paralogs Ikzf1 and Ikzf3 increases incrementally during 
B-cell progenitor differentiation, and, remarkably, inducible Ikaros expression
in cycling pre-B cells was sufficient to drive transcriptional changes resembling
the differentiation of cycling to resting pre-Bcells in vivo. The data suggest
that Ikaros transcription factor dosage drives the progression of progenitors
along a predetermined lineage by regulating multiple targets in key pathways,
including pre-Bcell receptor signaling, cell cycle progression, and lymphocyte
receptor rearrangement.Our approachmay be of general use to map the contribution 
of transcription factors to cell lineage commitment and differentiation.

High concordance rate in monozygotic twins and familial clustering of patients
with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) indicate the involvement of strong genetic
factors in the development of PBC. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
and subsequent meta-analyses in European descent have identified HLA and 21
non-HLA susceptibility loci which are involved in IL12/IL12R signaling,
TNF/TLR-NFKB signaling and B cell differentiation in the development of PBC. To
identify susceptibility loci for PBC in Japanese population, a GWAS and
subsequent replication study was performed in a total of 1327 PBC cases and 1120 
healthy controls. In addition to the most significant susceptibility region at
HLA, two significant (p<5×10(-8)) susceptibility loci (TNFSF15 and POU2AF1) were 
identified. Although these susceptibility loci are different from those
identified in European descent (IL12A, IL12RB2, SPIB), these loci are involved in
the same signaling pathways, differentiation of T lymphocyte to Th1 cells and
differentiation of B lymphocyte to plasma cells. Among 21 non-HLA susceptibility 
loci for PBC identified in GWASs of European descent, 10 loci (CD80, IKZF3, IL7R,
NFKB1, STAT4, TNFAIP2, CXCR5, MAP3K7IP1, rs6974491, DENND1B) showed significant
associations in the Japanese population. The comparative analysis of
disease-susceptibility genes in multiple ethnicities may provide an important
clue for the dissection of disease-pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified associations of
genetic variants at 17q21 near ORMDL3 with childhood asthma.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether associations in this region are
specific to particular asthma phenotypes and specific to ORMDL3.
METHODS: We examined associations between 244 independent single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) plus 13 previously identified asthma-related SNPs in the
region between 34 and 36 Mb on chromosome 17 and early wheezing phenotypes,
doctor-diagnosed asthma and atopy at 7½ years, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness 
and lung function at 8½ years in 7045 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study
of Parents and Children birth cohort study. With this, cis expression
quantitative trait loci signals for the same SNPs were assessed in 875 samples
across genes in the same region.
RESULTS: The strongest evidence for phenotypic association was seen for
persistent wheezing (rs8076131 near ORMDL3: relative risk ratio [RRR], 1.60 [95% 
CI, 1.40-1.84], P = 1.4 × 10(-11); rs2305480 near GSDML: RRR, 1.60 [95% CI,
1.39-1.83], P = 1.5 × 10(-11); and rs9303277 near IKZF3: RRR, 1.57 [95% CI,
1.37-1.79], P = 4.4 × 10(-11)). Similar but less precisely estimated effects were
seen for intermediate-onset wheeze, but there was little evidence of associations
with other wheezing phenotypes. There was some evidence of associations with
bronchial hyperresponsiveness. SNPs across the whole region show strong evidence 
of association with differential levels of expression at GSDML, IKZF3, and MED24,
as well as ORMDL3.
CONCLUSIONS: Associations of SNPs in the 17q21 locus are specific to asthma and
specific wheezing phenotypes and are not explained by associations with
intermediate phenotypes, such as atopy or lung function.

For the identification of susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 963 Japanese
individuals (487 PBC cases and 476 healthy controls) and in a subsequent
replication study that included 1,402 other Japanese individuals (787 cases and
615 controls). In addition to the most significant susceptibility region, human
leukocyte antigen (HLA), we identified two significant susceptibility loci,
TNFSF15 (rs4979462) and POU2AF1 (rs4938534) (combined odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, p =
2.84 × 10(-14) for rs4979462, and combined OR = 1.39, p = 2.38 × 10(-8) for
rs4938534). Among 21 non-HLA susceptibility loci for PBC identified in GWASs of
individuals of European descent, three loci (IL7R, IKZF3, and CD80) showed
significant associations (combined p = 3.66 × 10(-8), 3.66 × 10(-9), and 3.04 ×
10(-9), respectively) and STAT4 and NFKB1 loci showed suggestive association with
PBC (combined p = 1.11 × 10(-6) and 1.42 × 10(-7), respectively) in the Japanese 
population. These observations indicated the existence of ethnic differences in
genetic susceptibility loci to PBC and the importance of TNF signaling and B cell
differentiation for the development of PBC in individuals of European descent and
Japanese individuals.

CD4(+) interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (T(H)17 cells) are
instrumental in the immune response to pathogens. However, an overactive T(H)17
response results in tissue inflammation and autoimmunity, and therefore it is
important to identify the molecular mechanisms that control the development of
T(H)17 cells. IL-2 suppresses such development, but how IL-2 production is
actively suppressed during T(H)7 differentiation is not understood. Here we
report that under T(H)17-polarizing conditions, the transcription factors STAT3
and AhR upregulated the expression of Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of
transcription factors. Using Aiolos-deficient mice, we demonstrated that Aiolos
silenced the Il2 locus, promoting T(H)17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo.
Thus, we have identified a module in the transcriptional program of T(H)17 cells 
that actively limits IL-2 production and promotes their differentiation.

BACKGROUND: Although an association between 17q12-21 and asthma has been
replicated across different populations, some inconsistencies have been found
between different studies.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between genetic variation in this
region with asthma, lung function, airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness
(AHR), and atopy in a case-control study of United Kingdom adults. The
interaction between genotype and smoking was also evaluated.
METHODS: Study subjects (n = 983) were carefully phenotyped using questionnaires,
measurement of lung function, AHR (methacholine challenge), exhaled nitric oxide 
(eNO), and assessment of atopic status. Blood/saliva/buccal swabs were collected,
and 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 17q12-21 were genotyped using
MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted LASER desorption/ionisation-time of flight) mass
spectrometry. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of 28 common SNPs within
6 genes of interest (IKZF3, ZPBP2, ORMDL3, GSDMA, GSDMB, TOP2A).
RESULTS: Sixteen SNPs were significantly associated with asthma after multiple
testing correction (P = .01), of which 5 (rs2290400, rs8079416, rs3894194,
rs7212938, and rs3859192) were strongly associated (FDR P = .0002), and one was
novel (IKZF3-rs1453559). For 3 of these SNPs, we found significant interaction
with smoking and asthma (rs12936231, rs2290400, and rs8079416). Smoking modified 
the associations between 8 SNPs and lung function (rs9911688, rs9900538,
rs1054609, rs8076131, rs3902025, rs3859192, rs11540720, and rs11650680). We
observed significant interaction between 5 SNPs and smoking on AHR, and 3
interacted with smoking in relation to asthma with AHR (rs4795404, rs4795408,
rs3859192).
CONCLUSION: We found 1 novel association and replicated several previously
reported associations between 17q12-21 polymorphisms and asthma. We demonstrated 
significant interactions between active smoking and polymorphisms in 17q12-21
with asthma, lung function, and AHR in adults. Our data confirm that 17q12-21 is 
an important asthma susceptibility locus.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic heterogeneous autoimmune disorder
characterized by the loss of tolerance to self-antigens and dysregulated
interferon responses. The etiology of SLE is complex, involving both heritable
and environmental factors. Candidate-gene studies and genome-wide association
(GWA) scans have been successful in identifying new loci that contribute to
disease susceptibility; however, much of the heritable risk has yet to be
identified. In this study, we sought to replicate 1,580 variants showing
suggestive association with SLE in a previously published GWA scan of European
Americans; we tested a multiethnic population consisting of 7,998 SLE cases and
7,492 controls of European, African American, Asian, Hispanic, Gullah, and
Amerindian ancestry to find association with the disease. Several genes relevant 
to immunological pathways showed association with SLE. Three loci exceeded the
genome-wide significance threshold: interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8;
rs11644034; p(meta-Euro) = 2.08 × 10(-10)), transmembrane protein 39A (TMEM39A;
rs1132200; p(meta-all) = 8.62 × 10(-9)), and 17q21 (rs1453560; p(meta-all) =
3.48 × 10(-10)) between IKAROS family of zinc finger 3 (AIOLOS; IKZF3) and zona
pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2). Fine mapping, resequencing, imputation, and 
haplotype analysis of IRF8 indicated that three independent effects tagged by
rs8046526, rs450443, and rs4843869, respectively, were required for risk in
individuals of European ancestry. Eleven additional replicated effects (5 ×
10(-8) < p(meta-Euro) < 9.99 × 10(-5)) were observed with CFHR1, CADM2,
LOC730109/IL12A, LPP, LOC63920, SLU7, ADAMTSL1, C10orf64, OR8D4, FAM19A2, and
STXBP6. The results of this study increase the number of confirmed SLE risk loci 
and identify others warranting further investigation.

We have previously shown that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk alleles overlap
between different ethnic groups. Here, we utilize a multiethnic approach to show 
that we can effectively discover RA risk alleles. Thirteen putatively associated 
SNPs that had not yet exceeded genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) in our
previous RA genome-wide association study (GWAS) were analyzed in independent
sample sets consisting of 4,366 cases and 17,765 controls of European, African
American, and East Asian ancestry. Additionally, we conducted an overall
association test across all 65,833 samples (a GWAS meta-analysis plus the
replication samples). Of the 13 SNPs investigated, four were significantly below 
the study-wide Bonferroni corrected p value threshold (p < 0.0038) in the
replication samples. Two SNPs (rs3890745 at the 1p36 locus [p = 2.3 × 10(-12)]
and rs2872507 at the 17q12 locus [p = 1.7 × 10(-9)]) surpassed genome-wide
significance in all 16,659 RA cases and 49,174 controls combined. We used
available GWAS data to fine map these two loci in Europeans and East Asians, and 
we found that the same allele conferred risk in both ethnic groups. A series of
bioinformatic analyses identified TNFRSF14-MMEL1 at the 1p36 locus and
IKZF3-ORMDL3-GSDMB at the 17q12 locus as the genes most likely associated with
RA. These findings demonstrate empirically that a multiethnic approach is an
effective strategy for discovering RA risk loci, and they suggest that combining 
GWASs across ethnic groups represents an efficient strategy for gaining
statistical power.

Chinese Han population.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies of asthma have identified a novel
region containing ORMDL3 at chromosome 17q21 that is strongly associated with
childhood-onset asthma and significantly linked to ORMDL3 transcript abundance.
These results have been successfully replicated in childhood-onset asthma cohorts
in several ethnic groups. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of 
polymorphisms in ORMDL3, GSDMB, ZPBP2 and IKZF3 and adult-onset asthma in a
Chinese Han population.
METHODS: We genotyped 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosome
17q21 in 1,366 Han Chinese people comprising 710 patients with adult-onset asthma
and 656 healthy controls. We compared the 2 groups in terms of allele and
haplotype frequencies. Transcript levels were measured in leukocytes from 61
asthma patients by quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: We found the 5 SNPs significantly associated with asthma (P<0.05), of
which 2, rs11557467 and rs9303277, were strongly associated (P<0.001). Subjects
carrying the G allele of rs11557467 or the C allele of rs9303277 showed increased
risk of asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.51, P =
0.006, and OR 1.27, 1.07-1.49, P = 0.005, respectively), even after adjusting for
age and sex. The risk of asthma was lower for carriers of the haplotype CTGTT (OR
0.81, 0.67-0.97, P = 0.02). The risk allele for each SNP was associated with
increased expression of ORMDL3 and GSDMB in leukocytes (all p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our replication study suggests that variants in 17q21 are
significantly associated with risk of adult-onset asthma and gene expression in a
Chinese Han population.

To examine the genetics of susceptibility to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),
genome-wide association studies GWAS have been performed in patients of European 
ancestry and have shown the significant associations of IL12-related pathways,
SPIB, IRF5-TNPO3, and 17q12-21. We tested whether these findings could be
extended to a Japanese cohort, 303 Japanese PBC and 298 controls. We failed to
detect significant associations at IL12A (rs574808, rs1075498) and IL12RB2
(rs3790567). There was no genetic variance at IRF5-TNPO3 (rs10488631) in
Japanese. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at SPIB (rs3745516) reached
nominal significance, but the corrected P value did not reach significance. For
the 17q12-21 region, two SNPs had nominally significant associations [GSDMB
(rs2305480, P = 0.022) and ZPBP2 (rs11557467, P = 0.021)] and we noted a
significant P value at a SNP in IKZF3 (rs939327, P = 0.0024, P(c) = 0.017) after 
correction for multiple comparisons. Thus, these results indicate a haplotype on 
17q12-21 with a similar association in Japanese and European PBC.

lymphoblastic leukemia protects against type 1 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: IKZF1 encoding Ikaros, an essential regulator of lymphopoiesis and
immune homeostasis, has been implicated in the development of childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL). Because recent genome-wide association (GWA)
studies have linked a region of the 3'-UTR of IKZF1 with C-ALL susceptibility, we
tested whether IKZF1 is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: rs10272724 (T>C) near IKZF1 at 7p12 was genotyped in
8,333 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 9,947 control subjects, and 3,997
families of European ancestry. Association was tested using logistic regression
in the case-control data and by the transmission disequilibrium test in the
families. Expression data for IKZF1 by rs10272724 genotype were obtained using
quantitative PCR of mRNA/cDNA generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from 88 individuals, whereas expression data for five other neighboring genes
were obtained from the online Genevar dataset.
RESULTS: The minor allele of rs10272724 (C) was found to be protective from type 
1 diabetes (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.83-0.91]; P = 1.1 × 10(-11)). rs10272724
was not correlated with levels of two transcripts of IKZF1 in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The major susceptibility genotype for C-ALL confers protection from 
type 1 diabetes. Our finding strengthens the link between autoimmunity and
lymphoid cancers. Further investigation is warranted for the genetic effect
marked by rs10272724, its impact on IKZF1, and the role of Ikaros and other
family members, Ailios (IKZF3) and Eos (IKZF4), in autoimmunity.

BACKGROUND: Until recently, chromosomal translocations and fusion genes have been
an underappreciated class of mutations in solid tumors. Next-generation
sequencing technologies provide an opportunity for systematic characterization of
cancer cell transcriptomes, including the discovery of expressed fusion genes
resulting from underlying genomic rearrangements.
RESULTS: We applied paired-end RNA-seq to identify 24 novel and 3 previously
known fusion genes in breast cancer cells. Supported by an improved bioinformatic
approach, we had a 95% success rate of validating gene fusions initially detected
by RNA-seq. Fusion partner genes were found to contribute promoters (5' UTR),
coding sequences and 3' UTRs. Most fusion genes were associated with copy number 
transitions and were particularly common in high-level DNA amplifications. This
suggests that fusion events may contribute to the selective advantage provided by
DNA amplifications and deletions. Some of the fusion partner genes, such as GSDMB
in the TATDN1-GSDMB fusion and IKZF3 in the VAPB-IKZF3 fusion, were only detected
as a fusion transcript, indicating activation of a dormant gene by the fusion
event. A number of fusion gene partners have either been previously observed in
oncogenic gene fusions, mostly in leukemias, or otherwise reported to be
oncogenic. RNA interference-mediated knock-down of the VAPB-IKZF3 fusion gene
indicated that it may be necessary for cancer cell growth and survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, using RNA-sequencing and improved bioinformatic
stratification, we have discovered a number of novel fusion genes in breast
cancer, and identified VAPB-IKZF3 as a potential fusion gene with importance for 
the growth and survival of breast cancer cells.

with epigenetic modifications.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a clonal accumulation of
mature neoplastic B cells that are resistant to apoptosis. Aiolos, a member of
the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcription factors, plays an important role
in the control of mature B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation. In this
study, we showed that Aiolos expression is up-regulated in B-CLL cells. This
overexpression does not implicate isoform imbalance or disturb Aiolos subcellular
localization. The chromatin status at the Aiolos promoter in CLL is defined by
the demethylation of DNA and an enrichment of euchromatin associated histone
markers, such as the dimethylation of the lysine 4 on histone H3. These
epigenetic modifications should allow its upstream effectors, such as nuclear
factor-<U+03BA>B, constitutively activated in CLL, to gain access to promoter, resulting
up-regulation of Aiolos. To determine the consequences of Aiolos deregulation in 
CLL, we analyzed the effects of Aiolos overexpression or down-regulation on
apoptosis. Aiolos is involved in cell survival by regulating the expression of
some Bcl-2 family members. Our results strongly suggest that Aiolos deregulation 
by epigenetic modifications may be a hallmark of CLL.

Department of Molecular Oncology, Marseille, France.

BACKGROUND: Around 20% of breast cancers (BC) show ERBB2 gene amplification and
overexpression of the ERBB2 tyrosine kinase receptor. They are associated with a 
poor prognosis but can benefit from targeted therapy. A better knowledge of these
BCs, genomically and biologically heterogeneous, may help understand their
behavior and design new therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: We defined the high resolution genome and gene expression profiles of 54
ERBB2-amplified BCs using 244K oligonucleotide array-comparative genomic
hybridization and whole-genome DNA microarrays. Expression of ERBB2,
phosphorylated ERBB2, EGFR, IGF1R and FOXA1 proteins was assessed by
immunohistochemistry to evaluate the functional ERBB2 status and identify
co-expressions.
RESULTS: First, we identified the ERBB2-C17orf37-GRB7 genomic segment as the
minimal common 17q12-q21 amplicon, and CRKRS and IKZF3 as the most frequent
centromeric and telomeric amplicon borders, respectively. Second, GISTIC analysis
identified 17 other genome regions affected by copy number aberration (CNA)
(amplifications, gains, losses). The expression of 37 genes of these regions was 
deregulated. Third, two types of heterogeneity were observed in ERBB2-amplified
BCs. The genomic profiles of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) 
ERBB2-amplified BCs were different. The WNT/ß-catenin signaling pathway was
involved in ER- ERBB2-amplified BCs, and PVT1 and TRPS1 were candidate oncogenes 
associated with ER+ ERBB2-amplified BCs. The size of the ERBB2 amplicon was
different in inflammatory (IBC) and non-inflammatory BCs. ERBB2-amplified IBCs
were characterized by the downregulated and upregulated mRNA expression of ten
and two genes in proportion to CNA, respectively. IHC results showed (i) a linear
relationship between ERBB2 gene amplification and its gene and protein
expressions with a good correlation between ERBB2 expression and phosphorylation 
status; (ii) a potential signaling cross-talk between EGFR or IGF1R and ERBB2,
which could influence response of ERBB2-positive BCs to inhibitors. FOXA1 was
frequently coexpressed with ERBB2 but its expression did not impact on the
outcome of patients with ERBB2-amplified tumors.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that ER+ and ER- ERBB2-amplified BCs are different,
distinguished ERBB2 amplicons in IBC and non-IBC, and identified genomic features
that may be useful in the design of alternative therapeutical strategies.

Ikaros and Aiolos inhibit pre-B-cell proliferation by directly suppressing c-Myc 
expression.

Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5805, USA.

Pre-B-cell expansion is driven by signals from the interleukin-7 receptor and the
pre-B-cell receptor and is dependent on cyclin D3 and c-Myc. We have shown
previously that interferon regulatory factors 4 and 8 induce the expression of
Ikaros and Aiolos to suppress pre-B-cell proliferation. However, the molecular
mechanisms through which Ikaros and Aiolos exert their growth inhibitory effect
remain to be determined. Here, we provide evidence that Aiolos and Ikaros bind to
the c-Myc promoter in vivo and directly suppress c-Myc expression in pre-B cells.
We further show that downregulation of c-Myc is critical for the
growth-inhibitory effect of Ikaros and Aiolos. Ikaros and Aiolos also induce
expression of p27 and downregulate cyclin D3 in pre-B cells, and the
growth-inhibitory effect of Ikaros and Aiolos is compromised in the absence of
p27. A time course analysis further reveals that downregulation of c-Myc by
Ikaros and Aiolos precedes p27 induction and cyclin D3 downregulation. Moreover, 
downregulation of c-Myc by Ikaros and Aiolos is necessary for the induction of
p27 and downregulation of cyclin D3. Collectively, our studies identify a
pre-B-cell receptor signaling induced inhibitory network, orchestrated by Ikaros 
and Aiolos, which functions to terminate pre-B-cell expansion.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Zagreb, Croatia.

Transcription factors from the Ikaros family are involved in lymphocyte
differentiation and have a critical role at specific check points of the
haemopoietic pathway. However, how developmentally regulated changes are
reflected in gene expression programs of lymphocyte differentiation is not well
understood. It has been suggested that disregulation of transcription factors
from the Ikaros family is associated with the development of different human
leukemias. In this work we analyzed the state of Ikaros family members in
different leukemic cells with the aim to explore the transcriptional control of
human hematopoietic lineages and shed some new light on our understanding of
transcription factor significance in human leukemias. By means of RT-PCR and
specific primers we investigated the expression of Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios
transcription factors and their splicing variants in seven leukemia cell lines
derived from different types of leukemia (ALL, CML, AML) and lymphoma
(histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma). In
all of the cell lines examined Ikaros was present in dominant Ik1 to Ik4 isoforms
and small Ik6 isoform was absent. Aiolos was expressed in the majority of the
cell lines, of both, B and T origin, in the form of the full length Aio1. Helios 
was also present only in two long isoforms Hel1 and Hel2, and was absent in one
third of the lines. Similar distribution of positive and negative expression of
Aiolos and Helios found in various types of leukemias could implicate common
pathways of their regulation.

Early B cell factor (EBF)1 is essential for B lineage specification. Previously, 
we demonstrated the synergistic activation of Cd79a (mb-1) genes by EBF1 and its 
functional partner, RUNX1. Here, we identified consequences of Ebf1
haploinsufficiency together with haploinsufficiency of Runx1 genes in mice.
Although numbers of "committed" pro-B cells were maintained in
Ebf1(+/-)Runx1(+/-) (ER(het)) mice, activation of B cell-specific gene
transcription was depressed in these cells. Expression of genes encoding Aiolos, 
kappa0 sterile transcripts, CD2 and CD25 were reduced and delayed in ER(het)
pro-B cells, whereas surface expression of BP-1 was increased on late pro-B cells
in ER(het) mice. Late pre-B and immature and mature B cells were decreased in the
bone marrow of Ebf1(+/-) (E(het)) mice and were nearly absent in ER(het) mice.
Although we did not observe significant effects of haploinsuficiencies on IgH or 
Igkappa rearrangements, a relative lack of Iglambda rearrangements was detected
in E(het) and ER(het) pre-B cells. Together, these observations suggest that B
cell lineage progression is impaired at multiple stages in the bone marrow of
E(het) and ER(het) mice. Furthermore, enforced expression of EBF1 and RUNX1 in
terminally differentiated plasmacytoma cells activated multiple early B
cell-specific genes synergistically. Collectively, these studies illuminate the
effects of reduced Ebf1 dosage and the compounding effects of reduced Runx1
dosage. Our data confirm and extend the importance of EBF1 in regulating target
genes and Ig gene rearrangements necessary for B cell lineage specification,
developmental progression, and homeostasis.

The Aiolos transcription factor plays a crucial role in the control of lymphocyte
differentiation and proliferation. The expression of Aiolos isoform has been
studied in lymphoid pathologies but nothing is known about its expression in
unaffected human hematopoietic subpopulations. In this manuscript we show for the
first time the differential Aiolos expression at the RNA and protein level in
hematopoietic cell subpopulations. B cells express higher levels of Aiolos than
NK and T cells while monocytes express almost undetectable levels of Aiolos.
Moreover, human CD34 (+) progenitors do not express Aiolos. We did not observe
significant difference when comparing naive to memory T and B cells, but we
observed an important difference between Bright and Dim NK cells. Furthermore, we
show that, in addition to hematopoietic cells, non hematopoietic cell lines such 
as MCF-7, SW480, HEK, PC3 and HeLa also express Aiolos.

Antigen binding to B cell receptor (BCR) of pre-mature B lymphocytes leads to
their apoptosis, while binding to BCR of mature B lymphocytes induces their
activation and proliferation. The former binding is believed to be a mechanism so
as to exclude B cell clones leading to protection from auto-immune diseases.
Cross-linking of BCR of pre-mature B cells, including chicken DT40 cells, with
anti-immunoglobulin antibody induces their apoptosis. The PMA/ionomycin
treatments, which mimic BCR stimulation, are used to study intracellular signal
transduction of B lymphocytes. Here, by analyzing the Aiolos-deficient DT40 cell 
line, Aiolos(-/-), we reveal that the lack of Aiolos accelerates apoptosis of
DT40 cells mediated by BCR signaling. Moreover, the Aiolos-deficiency and BCR
signaling cooperatively control this apoptosis through dramatically elevated
cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol and elevated caspase
(caspase-3, 8 and 9) activities, resulting in drastically diminished amounts of
ICAD followed by increased DNA fragmentation. Re-expression study reveals that
the shorter isoform of Aiolos (Aio-2) controls PMA/ionomycin-mediated apoptosis
via up-regulation and down-regulation of the PKCdelta and bak genes,
respectively. These findings could be a powerful trigger to resolve molecular
mechanisms of negative selection of B lymphocytes and also auto-immune diseases.

Plasma cells represent the end stage of B-cell development and play a key role in
providing an efficient antibody response, but they are also involved in numerous 
pathologies. Here we show that CD93, a receptor expressed during early B-cell
development, is reinduced during plasma-cell differentiation. High CD93/CD138
expression was restricted to antibody-secreting cells both in T-dependent and
T-independent responses as naive, memory, and germinal-center B cells remained
CD93-negative. CD93 was expressed on (pre)plasmablasts/plasma cells, including
long-lived plasma cells that showed decreased cell cycle activity, high levels of
isotype-switched Ig secretion, and modification of the transcriptional network.
T-independent and T-dependent stimuli led to re-expression of CD93 via 2
pathways, either before or after CD138 or Blimp-1 expression. Strikingly, while
humoral immune responses initially proceeded normally, CD93-deficient mice were
unable to maintain antibody secretion and bone-marrow plasma-cell numbers,
demonstrating that CD93 is important for the maintenance of plasma cells in bone 
marrow niches.

The chromatin regulator Aiolos and the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 have
been implicated in regulating aspects of B cell maturation and activation. Mice
lacking either of these factors have a largely normal early B cell development.
However, when both factors are eliminated simultaneously a block is uncovered at 
the transition between pre-B and immature B cells, indicating that these proteins
exert a critical function in developing B lymphocytes. In mice deficient for
Aiolos and OBF-1, the numbers of immature B cells are reduced, small pre-BII
cells are increased and a significant impairment in immunoglobulin light chain
DNA rearrangement is observed. We identified genes whose expression is
deregulated in the pre-B cell compartment of these mice. In particular, we found 
that components of the pre-BCR, such as the surrogate light chain genes lambda5
and VpreB, fail to be efficiently silenced in double-mutant mice. Strikingly,
developmentally regulated nuclear repositioning of the lambda5 gene is impaired
in pre-B cells lacking OBF-1 and Aiolos. These studies uncover a novel role for
OBF-1 and Aiolos in controlling the transcription and nuclear organization of
genes involved in pre-BCR function.

The transcription factor Pax5 is essential for B cell commitment in the mouse,
where it represses lineage-inappropriate gene expression while simultaneously
activating the B cell gene expression program. In this study we have performed a 
global gene expression screen of wild-type and Pax5-deficient pro-B cells in an
attempt to identify the crucial Pax5 targets in early B lymphopoiesis. These
studies have identified 109 Pax5 targets comprising 61% activated and 39%
repressed genes. Interestingly, Pax5 directly regulates the genes encoding a
number of transcription factors that are required at the pre-B cell stage of
differentiation, including Irf8, Spib, and Ikzf3 (Aiolos), suggesting that a key 
function of Pax5 is to activate secondary transcription factors that further
reinforce the B cell program. Pax5 is also required for the expression of many
genes known to be involved in adhesion and signaling, indicating that Pax5
modulates the homing and or migration properties of B cell progenitors. Finally, 
Pax5 also represses a cohort of genes that are involved in multiple biological
processes, many of which are not typically associated with B cells. These include
the repression of the adhesion molecule Embigin, which is expressed in bone
marrow progenitors, T cells, and myeloid cells but is specifically repressed by
Pax5 in B cells.

In order to investigate the epigenetic component of Aiolos regulation, we
analyzed the methylation status of its 5' CpG island in relation to histone
modifications. Inhibition of CpG methylation restores Aiolos expression, as well 
as euchromatin-associated markers, in U937 and 1106 mel cell lines. DNA
methylation and low levels of euchromatin-associated signatures are observed in
U937 and 1106 mel cell lines, while the opposite characterizes Daudi, Jurkat, T
and B cells. CpG methylation is not necessary to repress transcription in
monocytes and melanocytes where silencing mechanism involves
heterochromatin-associated signature. We show that DNA methylation directs Aiolos
silencing and chromatin status in tumor cell lines, while in primary cells is
mainly regulated by histone modifications.

The Aiolos transcription factor, member of the Ikaros family of zinc finger
proteins, plays an important role in the control of mature B lymphocyte
differentiation and proliferation, and its function appears to be modulated
through alternative splicing. To assess Aiolos isoform role in humans'
pathologies, we studied Aiolos variant distribution and expression in mature B
lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and other
B-cell lymphomas). We demonstrated that more than 80% of expressed Aiolos in
normal as well as in malignant B cells is of the hAio1 type, and we showed for
the first time a homogeneous overexpression of the total amounts of Aiolos
transcripts in the B cells of CLL patients, independently of ZAP-70 and IgV(H)
mutational status prognosis factors. This up-regulation of Aiolos, confirmed at
protein level, seems independent of Aiolos promoter H3K9 acetylation and H3K4
trimethylation.

Interferon regulatory factors 4 and 8 induce the expression of Ikaros and Aiolos 
to down-regulate pre-B-cell receptor and promote cell-cycle withdrawal in

Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5805, USA.

Pre-B lymphocytes consist of 2 distinct cell populations: large pre-B and small
pre-B. The large pre-B cells are newly generated pre-B cells that express
pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) on the surface and are highly proliferative; small 
pre-B cells are derived from large pre-B cells that have down-regulated pre-BCR
and withdrawn from cell cycle. The molecular events that mediate the transition
from cycling pre-B to small, resting pre-B have not been fully elucidated. Here, 
we show that interferon regulatory factors 4 and 8 (IRF4,8) suppress surrogate
light chain expression and down-regulate pre-BCR in pre-B cells. Our studies
further reveal that IRF4,8 induce the expression of Ikaros and Aiolos in pre-B
cells, and reconstitution of expression of either one is sufficient to suppress
surrogate light chain expression and down-regulate pre-BCR in pre-B cells lacking
IRF4,8. Interestingly, our results also indicate that pre-B cells undergo growth 
inhibition and cell-cycle arrest in the presence of IRF4,8. Moreover, we provide 
evidence that Ikaros and Aiolos are indispensable for the down-regulation of
pre-BCR and the cell-cycle withdrawal mediated by IRF4,8. Thus, IRF4,8
orchestrate the transition from large pre-B to small pre-B cells by inducing the 
expression of Ikaros and Aiolos.

The transcription factor Aiolos (also known as IKZF3), a member of the Ikaros
family of zinc-finger proteins, plays an important role in the control of B
lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation. Previously, multiple isoforms of
Ikaros family members arising from differential splicing have been described and 
we now report a number of novel isoforms of Aiolos. It has been demonstrated that
full-length Ikaros family isoforms localize to heterochromatin and that they can 
associate with complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC). In this study,
for the first time we directly investigate the cellular localization of various
Aiolos isoforms, their ability to heterodimerize with Ikaros and associate with
HDAC-containing complexes, and the effects on histone modification and binding to
putative targets. Our work demonstrates that the cellular activities of Aiolos
isoforms are dependent on combinations of various functional domains arising from
the differential splicing of mRNA transcripts. These data support the general
principle that the function of an individual protein is modulated through
alternative splicing, and highlight a number of potential implications for Aiolos
in normal and aberrant lymphocyte function.

Aiolos controls gene conversion and cell death in DT40 B cells.

The Ikaros family transcription factor Aiolos is important for B cell function,
since B cells of Aiolos-null mutant mice exhibit an activated phenotype, enhanced
B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling response and develop a systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) type autoimmune disease. Aiolos has also been reported to
interact with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) in T cells, but whether Aiolos
regulates cell death has not been studied in B cells. Here we show that the
disruption of Aiolos in the DT40 B cell line induces a cell death sensitive
phenotype, as the Aiolos(-/-) cells are more prone to apoptosis by nutritional
stress, BCR cross-linking, UV- or gamma-irradiation. Furthermore, the Aiolos(-/-)
cells have defective Ig gene conversion providing evidence that Aiolos is needed 
for the somatic diversification of the BCR repertoire. The re-expression of
DNA-binding isoform Aio-1 was able to restore the gene conversion defect of the
Aiolos-deficient cells, whereas the introduction of dominant negative isofom
Aio-2 had no effect on gene conversion, thus demonstrating the functional
importance of alternative splicing within Ikaros family. Although the Aiolos(-/-)
cells exhibit reduced expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), 
ectopic AID overexpression did not restore the gene conversion defect in the
Aiolos(-/-) cells. Our findings indicate that Aiolos may regulate gene conversion
in an AID independent manner.

To characterize the regulation of lymphoid Aiolos transcription factor, we have
cloned its promoter. Full promoter and nested deletions were expressed in
lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell lines. The minimal promoter activity could be
considered as a 172bp upstream from the ATG for Jurkat and HEK293 cells and as a 
370bp fragment for U937 cells. Moreover, we have mapped the transcription
initiation site. Retardation gels showed binding activity for Ikaros, NFkappaB
and AP4 transcription factors and mutations in their binding sites abolish Aiolos
promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Ikaros,
NFkappaB and AP4 are bound to Aiolos promoter. The important function of Ikaros
and NFkappaB is underlined by their over expression, which results in the
trans-activation of the promoter and drives Aiolos expression in cell lines and
in freshly isolated B and T cells, while over expression of a dominant negative
Ikaros isoform is able to block Aiolos expression.

Ikaros DNA-binding proteins are critical for the development of lymphocytes and
other hematopoietic lineages, but it remains unclear how they cooperate with
other regulators of signaling and transcription to achieve ordered gene
expression during development. Here, we show that Ikaros proteins regulate the
pre-BCR component lambda5 in a stage-specific manner. In pre-BI cells, Ikaros
modulated lambda5 expression in competition with the transcriptional activator
EBF. This required Ikaros binding to the Igll1 (lambda5) promoter and was
abolished either by mutation of the Ikaros DNA-binding domain or by deletion of a
single Ikaros site from the Igll1 promoter. At the transition from the pre-BI to 
pre-BII stage, the expression of the Ikaros family member Aiolos was upregulated 
and required for the efficient silencing of Igll1. Aiolos expression was
controlled by pre-BCR signals via the adaptor protein SLP-65. Thus, pre-BCR
signaling regulates Aiolos and the silencing of Igll1 via a
developmental-stage-specific feedback loop.

Chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but
alone fail to induce leukaemia. To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions, we
performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL
patients using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic
DNA sequencing. Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and
structural rearrangement in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene
was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of
cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted in reduced levels of PAX5 protein
or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions were also detected in TCF3
(also known as E2A), EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 (IKAROS) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS). These
findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell
development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis.
Moreover, these data demonstrate the power of high-resolution, genome-wide
approaches to identify new molecular lesions in cancer.

Paired box protein 5 (Pax5) is essential for early B cell commitment as well as
for B cell development, and continuous expression of Pax5 is required throughout 
the B cell lineage to maintain the functional identity of B cells. During B cell 
activation, Pax5 is downregulated before terminal differentiation into
antibody-secreting plasma cells, and enforced expression of Pax5 prevents
plasmacytic development. Recently, loss of Pax5 was shown to result in the
substantial transition to a plasma cell state, demonstrating a functionally
significant role for Pax5 in the regulation of terminal B cell differentiation.
Here we elucidate the current understanding about the function of Pax5 as a key
inhibitor of plasma cell differentiation.

Aiolos is required for the generation of high affinity bone marrow plasma cells
responsible for long-term immunity.

Cortés M(1), Georgopoulos K.

(1)Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

Antigenic encounter generates long-term immunity sustained by long-lived high
affinity plasma cells resident in the bone marrow (BM). Here we show that the
Ikaros family member, Aiolos, is specifically required for the generation of
these plasma cells. Failure to generate high affinity plasma cells in the BM and 
to sustain serum antibody titers is apparent after both primary and secondary
immunization of Aiolos(-)(/)(-) mice with a range of hapten concentrations.
Chimera reconstitutions demonstrate that the BM plasma cell defect is B cell
intrinsic. Lack of Aiolos does not alter expression of any of the previously
described factors required for general plasma cell differentiation. No defect in 
somatic hypermutation, the generation of memory B cells, or short-lived high
affinity plasma cells in the spleen was observed upon rechallenge. These studies 
support a model by which the high affinity plasma cell population in the BM

Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios: transcription regulators and lymphoid malignancies.

Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios encode zinc finger transcription factors that are
important regulators of lymphoid development and differentiation. These proteins 
are involved in the control of gene expression and when associated with nuclear
complexes, participate in nucleosome remodeling. Because differential splicing
produces multiple protein isoforms with potentially different functions, the
Ikaros protein family provides a useful model for the study of whether
post-transcriptional modifications are involved in tumoral transformation.
Several reports reinforce the hypothesis that Ikaros, Aiolos and Helios
expression is deregulated in human leukaemias. The direct involvement of aberrant
protein expression of Ikaros family members in human haematological malignancies 
is discussed.

Lack of the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 prevents the development of
systemic lupus erythematosus-like phenotypes in Aiolos mutant mice.

Foundation, Basel, Switzerland.

Here we show that mice lacking the zinc finger transcription factor Aiolos
develop the symptoms of human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is
characterized by the production of anti-dsDNA Ab and immune complex-mediated
glomerulonephritis. This finding indicates that normal Aiolos function is
necessary to maintain immune homeostasis and suppress the development of systemic
autoimmune disease and implicates Aiolos as a possible candidate gene for SLE.
Interestingly, Aiolos-null mice can no longer mount autoimmune reactions and
completely fail to develop SLE when they are deficient for the B cell-specific
transcription coactivator OBF-1. The lack of OBF-1 reverses several Aiolos mutant
mouse phenotypes, such as B cell hyperproliferation, high expression of
activation marker on B cells, and spontaneous germinal center formation.
Unexpectedly, B cell development at the immature B cell stage is severely
impaired in the bone marrow of Aiolos/OBF-1 double-deficient mice, demonstrating 
the key role of these factors in the transition from pre-B to immature B cells.
Our results indicate that B cells play a crucial role in the development of SLE
in Aiolos mutant mice and might be useful for the strategy of SLE treatment.

Aiolos is a transcriptional regulator of B cell development and belongs to the
Ikaros family of chromatin remodelling transcription factors. All the members of 
Ikaros family produce multiple isoforms via alternative mRNA splicing. Altered
expression of Ikaros isoforms has been found in patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia but it is not studied whether the altered expression of Aiolos isoforms 
also has a role in the development of leukemias or lymphomas. We developed a
quantitative real-time PCR application to detect the relative expression of
Aiolos splice variants. The method is based on fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET)-labelled isoform specific hybridisation probes used with the
LightCycler instrument. The isoform specificity is obtained by targeting the
probes at the edges of chosen exons. The probes are here shown to represent a
rapid, high throughput, specific and reproducible quantification method. We
designed and optimised the analysis for a dominant negative Aiolos isoform, but
the described method is applicable to any isoform-forming gene. This study shows 
that the real-time PCR with exon edge spanning probe pairs can be applied
generally to reveal the importance of alternative splicing and the role of
isoforms in normal development and diseases.

Aiolos and Ikaros: regulators of lymphocyte development, homeostasis and
lymphoproliferation.

Aiolos and Ikaros encode hemopoietic-specific zinc finger transcription factors
that are important regulators of lymphocyte differentiation. Aiolos and Ikaros
play a critical role in regulating B and T cell development. Gene targeting
studies in mice have shown that inactivation of Ikaros family proteins leads to a
complete absence of T, B, NK and dendritic cells, whereas a reduction of Ikaros
activity induce hyperproliferation and lymphomas. Aiolos knock-out mice have
quantitatively normal lymphoid cells but have chronically activated B cells
producing autoantibodies and develop lymphomas with increased frequency. These
proteins are involved in the control of gene expression and, associated to
nuclear complexes, participate in nucleosome remodeling. This protein family
governs cell fate decisions and regulates homeostasis through complex isoforms
expression and dimerization. Changes in this regulatory network may reflect
differentiation and proliferation adjustments made in lymphoid progenitors and
precursors. The direct involvement of aberrant Ikaros protein expression in human
hematological oncogenesis, although suggested by several studies, remains to be
settled at the genomic level. These points will be discussed in the present
review.

OBJECTIVE: In previous studies, we demonstrated overexpression of the
dominant-negative isoform of the transcription factor Ikaros, Ik-6, in patients
with blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia. In the present study, we analyzed expression of the Ikaros family genes
Ikaros, Aiolos, and Helios in a panel of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell
lines and bone marrow samples of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction, sequencing analysis, immunoblotting, and Southern blotting.
RESULTS: We found overexpression of novel short isoforms of Helios (Hel-5 and
Hel-6) in the HD-Mar cell line. Southern blot analysis suggested that there might
be a small deletion in the Helios locus of HD-Mar. In addition, we observed
decreased expression of more than one Ikaros family gene in 3 of 9 patients with 
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Moreover, one of the patients overexpressed 
novel short isoforms of Helios (Hel-7 and Hel-8).
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of an Ikaros family member
(other than Ikaros) of which novel short isoforms become overexpressed in human
leukemia.

Aiolos is a chromatin remodeling transcription regulator that plays an
antiproliferative role in B lymphocyte function. In contrast to the related
Ikaros factors, mammalian Aiolos has not been reported to generate splice
variants. In addition, although human leukemic lymphoblasts express
non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms with potential dominant negative effect on other 
interacting factors,the role of Aiolos in human lymphoid disorders has remained
obscure. To address the question, why Aiolos should delineate from Ikaros in such
a marked way, we have here analyzed whether also human Aiolos could generate
alternate isoforms. According to the results obtained, both normal and neoplastic
B lineage cells were found to express at least five novel Aiolos variants. Also
structurally dominant negative variants with less than three DNA-binding domains 
were identified. In conclusion, given the multiplicity of also human Aiolos
isoforms and thereby the evidently more intricate contribution of Aiolos to the
chromatin remodeling machinery, it is suggested, that not only Ikaros, but also
Aiolos could participate in a more versatile manner in the regulation of B
lymphocyte function.

The association of Aiolos transcription factor and Bcl-xL is involved in the
control of apoptosis.

We have analyzed the mechanism implicated in the control of the anti-apoptotic
role of Bcl-xL. We show that IL-4 deprivation induces apoptosis, but does not
modulate Bcl-xL expression. Because Bcl-xL does not promote cell survival in the 
absence of IL-4, we investigate the mechanism by which Bcl-xL was unable to
inhibit apoptosis. Using yeast two-hybrid system, coimmunoprecipitation, and
indirect immunofluorescence techniques, we found that Bcl-xL interacts with the
transcription factor Aiolos in IL-4-stimulated cells, increasing upon IL-4
deprivation. IL-4 does not promote translocation of Aiolos or Bcl-xL, but induces
tyrosine phosphorylation of Aiolos, which is required for dissociation from
Bcl-xL. Transfection experiments confirm that cells overexpressing Bcl-xL are
able to prevent apoptosis in the absence of IL-4. On the contrary, cells that
overexpress Bcl-xL and Aiolos are unable to block apoptosis in the absence of
IL-4. We propose a model for the regulation of the Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic role via
Aiolos.

The follicular versus marginal zone B lymphocyte cell fate decision is regulated

Most splenic B cells in mice that lack Aiolos are mature IgD(hi)IgM(lo)
follicular lymphocytes, suggesting that maturation signals delivered via the BCR 
are enhanced in the absence of Aiolos. The enhanced maturation of follicular B
cells is accompanied by the absence of MZ B lymphocytes and the downregulation of
CD21 expression in follicular B cells, all of which depend on the generation of
signals via Btk, which is in epistasis to Aiolos. The inverse relationship
between the strength of BCR signaling and MZ B cell development is supported by
an examination of MZ B cells in CD21 null mice. These data support the view that 
antigens (in contrast to "tonic" signals) drive the development of naive B cells.

The Ikaros gene undergoes bi-allelic changes at a high frequency in
gamma-ray-induced mouse thymic lymphomas, suggesting the relevance of Ikaros to
the lymphoma development. Here we test whether Helios and Aiolos, two other
members of the Ikaros gene family, are also involved in lymphomagenesis. Genetic 
mapping showed that Helios is located between D1Mit531 and D1Mit19 on chromosome 
1 and Aiolos is between D11Mit222 and D11Mit332 on chromosome 11. Analysis using 
polymorphic markers around the two regions revealed that neither locus exhibited 
allelic loss in the 78 lymphomas that were induced in p53 wild-type mice, whereas
in 102 p53(KO / + ) mouse-derived lymphomas Helios and Aiolos loci showed allelic
loss in 8% (8 / 102) and 33% (34 / 102), respectively. However, 33 of the 34
lymphomas showing allelic loss at Aiolos were p53(KO / - ) and were accompanied
by loss of the p53 wild-type allele on the same chromosome. Homozygous deletion
and mutation analyses failed to detect bi-allelic alterations. These results do
not suggest any obvious contribution of Helios or Aiolos to oncogenesis of the
mouse thymic lymphomas.

Over the past few years, the long-standing idea that covalent modification of
chromatin can play a role in determining states of gene activity has been
confirmed. Eukaryotic genes can be silenced by deacetylation of acetyl-lysine
moieties in the N-terminal tails of histones. Recent work links histone
deacetylases with an increasing number of repressors, suggesting that
deacetylation might be a rather pervasive feature of transcriptional repression
systems.

The Ikaros gene (symbol ZNFN1A1) encodes the hematopoietic zinc finger DNA
binding protein, which is now recognized as a central regulator of lymphoid
differentiation and has been implicated in leukemogenesis. Recently, an
Ikaros-related zinc finger protein, called Aiolos (ZNFN1A3), has been identified 
and characterized, thus establishing the presence of a gene family whose members 
may be hematopoietic transcription factors. Among Aiolos-mutant mice, development
of B-cell lymphoma was frequently seen. As an initial approach to examining the
possible involvement of Aiolos in the pathogenesis of human lymphoid
proliferative disease, we isolated cDNA clones for human Aiolos from a B-cell
cDNA library. The human Aiolos protein predicted from the cDNA sequence consists 
of 509 amino acid residues and shares 86% sequence identity with its mouse
counterpart. As in the case with mouse Aiolos, no isoform for human Aiolos has
been found. Northern blot analysis of various human tissues revealed that the
Aiolos transcripts are expressed most strongly in peripheral blood leukocytes,
the spleen, and the thymus, supporting the notion that Aiolos plays an important 
role in lymphoid lineages. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a BAC clone
established that the Aiolos gene is mapped to human chromosome band 17q11.2.

Aiolos is an Ikaros-related lymphoid regulatory protein involved in B cell
development and function. To evaluate the role of Aiolos in avian B
lymphopoiesis, we have cloned and characterized the first non-mammalian Aiolos
ortholog in the avian. In sharp contrast to the avian Ikaros, expressed already
at the multipotential stage and prior to the colonization of the lymphoid
rudiments, Aiolos transcripts were not expressed in early ontogeny and were first
detected in cells isolated from the embryonic bursa of Fabricius and thymus. In
accordance with Ikaros, the avian Aiolos is also highly related to the mammalian 
homolog, thus suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function in lymphocyte
development. Interestingly, in contrast to the mammalian Aiolos, at least one
alternatively spliced form of avian Aiolos is detected in addition to the primary
full-length transcript. Both of these alternate transcripts are expressed in
bursa, thymus and peripheral lymphoid cells, and no major differences in the
expression were detected during lymphocyte development. Furthermore, avian Aiolos
is clearly expressed at various stages of B cell development, thus supporting
recent evidence for the importance of Aiolos in B cell development and function.

We searched for proteins that interact with Ras in interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated 
or IL-2-deprived cells, and found that the transcription factor Aiolos interacts 
with Ras. The Ras-Aiolos interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by
co-immunoprecipitation. Indirect immunofluorescence shows that IL-2 controls the 
cellular distribution of Aiolos and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation,
required for dissociation from Ras. We also identified functional Aiolos-binding 
sites in the Bcl-2 promoter, which are able to activate the luciferase reporter
gene. Mutation of Aiolos-binding sites within the Bcl-2 promoter inhibits
transactivation of the reporter gene luciferase, suggesting direct control of
Bcl-2 expression by Aiolos. Co-transfection experiments confirm that Aiolos
induces Bcl-2 expression and prevents apoptosis in IL-2-deprived cells. We
propose a model for the regulation of Bcl-2 expression via Aiolos.

Repression by Ikaros and Aiolos is mediated through histone deacetylase
complexes.

Author information: 
(1)Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can 
function as strong transcriptional repressors. This function is mediated through 
two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type. 
Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones
at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors. Consistent
with these findings, Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and
in vitro with the mSin3 family of co-repressors which bind to histone
deacetylases. Based on these and our recent findings of associations between
Ikaros and Mi-2-HDAC, we propose that Ikaros family members modulate gene
expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone
deacetylase complexes to specific promoters.

Lymphoid cell differentiation relies on precisely orchestrated gene activation

the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos in regulating multiple stages of B

molecules exist within T cells in nuclear complexes that contain nucleosome
remodeling and histone deacetylase activities.

The Ikaros gene family encodes zinc finger DNA-binding proteins essential for
lineage determination and control of proliferation in the lymphoid system. Here, 
we report that, in the nucleus of a T cell, a major fraction of Ikaros and Aiolos
proteins associate with the DNA-dependent ATPase Mi-2 and histone deacetylases,
in a 2 MD complex. This Ikaros-NURD complex is active in chromatin remodeling and
histone deacetylation. Upon T cell activation, Ikaros recruits Mi-2/HDAC to
regions of heterochromatin. These studies reveal that Ikaros proteins are capable
of targeting chromatin remodeling and deacetylation complexes in vivo. We propose
that the restructuring of chromatin is a key aspect of Ikaros function in
lymphocyte differentiation.

Aiolos encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in
mature B cells and is homologous to Ikaros. In the periphery of mice homozygous
for an Aiolos-null mutation, B cells exhibit an activated cell surface phenotype 
and undergo augmented antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated in vitro proliferative
responses, even at limiting amounts of stimulant. In vivo, T cell-dependent B
cell responses, including the formation of germinal centers and elevated serum
IgG and IgE, are detected in Aiolos-deficient mice in the absence of
immunization. Auto-antibodies and development of B cell lymphomas are frequently 
seen among aging Aiolos mutants. In sharp contrast to conventional B cells, B
cells of the peritoneum, of the marginal zone, and the recirculating bone marrow 
population are greatly reduced.

Helios, a novel dimerization partner of Ikaros expressed in the earliest
hematopoietic progenitors.

BACKGROUND: Normal hematopoietic development depends on the activity of the
Ikaros transcription factor, which contains distinct zinc-finger domains that
mediate DNA binding and protein dimerization. Mice homozygous for a transgene
encoding a dominant-negative version of Ikaros that lacks the DNA-binding domain 
but not the dimerization domain have a more severe phenotype than Ikaros null
mice. This observation suggests the presence of factor(s) that can dimerize with 
Ikaros and partially complement its function. One previously identified factor,
Aiolos, probably serves this role in the lymphoid system; a related factor
involved in hematopoietic progenitors remains unknown, however.
RESULTS: Here, we describe the cloning of an Ikaros-related gene, Helios.
Analysis of the primary sequences of Helios, Ikaros and Aiolos revealed that the 
DNA-binding, transcriptional activation and dimerization domains are functionally
conserved. Helios activated transcription from Ikaros DNA-binding sites and could
dimerize with itself, Ikaros or Aiolos. Expression of Helios was detected in the 
earliest hematopoietic sites of the embryo, in hematopoietic stem cells in the
adult and was subsequently restricted to a subset of cells in the T cell lineage.
Helios co-localized with Ikaros and Aiolos proteins in macromolecular nuclear
structures and formed stable complexes in vivo with the dominant-negative version
of Ikaros.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct but overlapping expression patterns of members of the
Ikaros gene family during hematopoiesis might result in the formation of
different multimeric complexes that have specific roles in lineage progression.
The preferential expression of Helios in the earliest stages of hematopoiesis
suggests that this gene functions predominantly in early progenitors.

Aiolos, a lymphoid restricted transcription factor that interacts with Ikaros to 
regulate lymphocyte differentiation.

Development of the lymphoid system is dependent on the activity of zinc finger
transcription factors encoded by the Ikaros gene. Differences between the
phenotypes resulting from a dominant-negative and a null mutation in this gene
suggest that Ikaros proteins act in concert with another factor with which they
form heterodimers. Here we report the cloning of Aiolos, a gene which encodes an 
Ikaros homologue that heterodimerizes with Ikaros proteins. In contrast to
Ikaros--which is expressed from the pluripotent stem cell to the mature
lymphocyte--Aiolos is first detected in more committed progenitors with a
lymphoid potential and is strongly up-regulated as these differentiate into pre-T
and pre-B cell precursors. The expression patterns of Aiolos and Ikaros, the
relative transcriptional activity of their homo- and heteromeric complexes, and
the dominant interfering effect of mutant Ikaros isoforms on Aiolos activity all 
strongly suggest that Aiolos acts in concert with Ikaros during lymphocyte
development. We therefore propose that increasing levels of Ikaros and Aiolos
homo- and heteromeric complexes in differentiating lymphocytes are essential for 
normal progression to a mature and immunocompetent state.

The role of the Ikaros gene in lymphocyte development and homeostasis.

Georgopoulos K(1), Winandy S, Avitahl N.

Author information: 
(1)Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, Charlestown 02129, USA.

The Ikaros gene, which encodes a family of hemopoietic-specific zinc finger
proteins, is described as a central regulator of lymphocyte differentiation.
During fetal development, it is required at the earliest stage of T cell and B
cell specification. In the adult, however, lymphoid lineages rely on Ikaros at
distinct phases of their development. Its activity is essential for the
generation of B cell but not of T cell precursors, although the differentiation
of the latter is not normal. A significant increase in CD4 thymocytes and their
immediate precursors is detected, and because these cells lack markers that
correlate with positive selection, a deregulation in their maturation process is 
suggested. Furthermore, Ikaros-null thymocytes hyperproliferate in response to T 
cell receptor (TCR) signaling; within days after their appearance in the thymus, 
clonally expanding populations are detected. Deregulated TCR-mediated responses
and the fast kinetics of tumor development in these mutant thymocytes implicate
Ikaros as a central tumor suppressor gene for the T cell lineage. In addition,
lack of natural killer cells and selective defects in gamma delta T cells and
dendritic antigen-presenting cells point to Ikaros as an essential factor for the
establishment of early branchpoints of the T cell pathway. The dominant
interference activity of Ikaros isoforms unable to bind DNA and their effects in 
lymphocyte development suggest that Ikaros works in concert with other factors.
The role of Aiolos, a lymphoid-restricted and structurally related gene, in
lymphoid differentiation is discussed. A model is proposed that defines Ikaros as
the backbone of a complex regulatory protein network that controls cell fate
decisions and regulates homeostasis in the hemo-lymphoid system. Changes in this 
regulatory network may reflect differentiation and proliferation adjustments made
