Human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1), a predominant a defensin in the azurophilic
granules of human neutrophils, is an alarmin capable of inducing the migration
and maturation of human myeloid/conventional dendritic cells. However, it is not 
determined whether it can activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Herein,
we found that both human pDCs and CAL-1 cells, a pDC-like cell line, produced
IFNa upon treatment with HNP1. Additionally, HNP1 could promote CpG ODN-induced
pDC production of proinflammatory cytokines including IFNa. HNP1 triggered
activation of NF-<U+03BA>B and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) in CAL-1 cells. HNP1 upregulation of cytokine expression in pDCs was
inhibited by blockade of NF-<U+03BA>B activation or knockdown of IRF1, demonstrating the
importance of these two signaling events in HNP1-induced pDC activation. Using a 
human pDC-nude mouse model, HNP1 was shown to induce IFNa production by human
pDCs in vivo. Thus, HNP1 can activate human pDCs using NF-<U+03BA>B and IRF signaling
pathways, and HNP-induced IFN production may participate in the inflammatory
pathogenesis in certain authoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) can induce a host antiviral response to foot and mouth
disease virus (FMDV) in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of IFN-<U+03B3>
anti FMDV infection in host cells, high-throughput RNA sequencing was analyzed
for systemic changes in gene expression profiles in PK15 cells infected by FMDV
with or without IFN-<U+03B3> pretreatment. More than 25 million reads, covering 1.2-1.5 
Gb, were analyzed from each experiment panel. FMDV challenge altered the
transcription of genes involved in positively and negatively regulating cell
death or apoptosis; however, the expected immune suppression response was not
obvious. IFN-<U+03B3> pretreatment combined with FMDV infection normalized the increase 
in apoptosis. Furthermore, the transcription factors required for IFN-<U+03B3>
functioning, STAT1 and IRF1 were up-regulated by IFN-<U+03B3> pretreatment and
stimulated downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These induced ISGs are mainly 
responsible for antigen processing, antigen presentation or antiviral defense.
Interestingly, a synergistic effect on some ISGs, including OAS1, OAS2, MX1, MX2,
RIG-I and IFIT1, was observed in the combined treatment compared to the IFN-<U+03B3>
treatment alone. The suggested effects identified by RNA sequencing were
consistent with cellular morphology changes and confirmed by related protein
markers. This is the first report exploring transcriptome alterations introduced 
by FMDV infection with or without IFN-<U+03B3> pretreatment. The identified key host
genes that control cell survival in vitro broaden our comprehensive understanding
of how IFN-<U+03B3> inhibits FMDV infection and may shed light on developing improved
FMD control approaches.

Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is an orthomyxovirus, which may cause
multisystemic disease and high mortality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). This
suggests that ISAV encodes proteins that antagonize the type I interferon (IFN-I)
system, which is of crucial importance in innate antiviral immunity. To find out 
how ISAV might inhibit IFN-I synthesis, we have here studied whether the two ISAV
proteins s7ORF1 and s8ORF2 might interfere with activation of the IFNa1 promoter 
mediated by overexpression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) or by the IFN 
promoter activation protein IPS-1. The IRF tested were IRF1, IRF3, IRF7A and
IRF7B. Promoter activation was measured using a luciferase reporter assay where
Atlantic salmon TO cells were co-transfected with the IFNa1 promoter reporter
plasmid together with an IRF plasmid and the s7ORF1 or the s8ORF2 construct or a 
control plasmid. The results showed that s7ORF1 significantly inhibited IRF3 and 
IRF7B induced IFN promoter activity, while s8ORF2 significantly inhibited IRF1
and IRF3 induced promoter activity. Neither s7ORF1 nor s8ORF2 inhibited IPS-1
mediated promoter activation. Immunoprecipitation data suggest that both s7ORF1
and s8ORF2 can bind to all four IRFs. Taken together, this study thus shows that 
the ISAV proteins s7ORF1 and s8ORF2 antagonizes IFN-I transcription activation
mediated by the IRFs. As such this work provides further insight into the
pathogenic properties of ISAV.

Toxoplasma gondii remains a global public health problem. However, its
pathophysiology is still not-completely understood particularly the impact of
infection on host liver metabolism. We performed iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis
to evaluate early liver protein responses in BALB/c mice following infection with
T. gondii PYS strain (genotype ToxoDB#9) infection. Our data revealed
modification of protein expression in key metabolic pathways, as indicated by the
upregulation of immune response and downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory
chain, and the metabolism of fatty acids, lipids and xenobiotics. T. gondii seems
to hijack host PPAR signaling pathway to downregulate the metabolism of fatty
acids, lipids and energy in the liver. The metabolism of over 400 substances was 
affected by the downregulation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The
top 10 transcription factors used by upregulated genes were Stat2, Stat1, Irf2,
Irf1, Sp2, Egr1, Stat3, Klf4, Elf1 and Gabpa, while the top 10 transcription
factors of downregulated genes were Hnf4A, Ewsr1, Fli1, Hnf4g, Nr2f1, Pparg,
Rxra, Hnf1A, Foxa1 and Foxo1. These findings indicate global reprogramming of the
metabolism of the mouse liver after acute T. gondii infection. Functional
characterization of the altered proteins may enhance understanding of the host
responses to T. gondii infection and lead to the identification of new
therapeutic targets.

IRF8 and IRF1 are transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in the
development and function of myeloid cells, including activation of macrophages by
proinflammatory signals such as interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>). Loss of IRF8 or IRF1
function causes severe susceptibility to infections in mice and in humans. We
used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing in wild type and
in IRF8 and IRF1 mutant primary macrophages to systematically catalog all of the 
genes bound by (cistromes) and transcriptionally activated by (regulomes) IRF8,
IRF1, PU.1, and STAT1, including modulation of epigenetic histone marks. Of the
seven binding combinations identified, two (cluster 1 [IRF8/IRF1/STAT1/PU.1] and 
cluster 5 [IRF1/STAT1/PU.1]) were found to have a major role in controlling
macrophage transcriptional programs both at the basal level and after IFN-<U+03B3>
activation. They direct the expression of a set of genes, the IRF8/IRF1 regulome,
that play critical roles in host inflammatory and antimicrobial defenses in mouse
models of neuroinflammation and of pulmonary tuberculosis, respectively. In
addition, this IRF8/IRF1 regulome is enriched for genes mutated in human primary 
immunodeficiencies and with loci associated with several inflammatory diseases in
humans.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for opposing oncogenic and tumor-suppressor 
activities of NF-kB are obscure. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry of
primary breast tumors using antibodies to RelA, the pleiotropic NF-kB factor, and
Ki67 revealed a negative correlation between RelA levels and Ki67-index among
ER +/HER2 - tumors [1]. Similarly, expression of AURKA, a marker for
proliferation, negatively correlates with expression of NFKBIA, a surrogate for
RelA expression and activity, in ER +/HER2 - tumors analyzed by The Cancer Genome
Atlas [2], [3], [4]. Furthermore, conditional expression of RelA using a
Tetracycline-inducible system in Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HRA cells)
caused proliferation arrest while withdrawal of Doxycycline (Dox) and suppression
of RelA expression in arrested cells restored cell cycle progression [1]. To
identify genes responsible for the negative relationship between RelA levels and 
proliferation, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of HRA cells
under the following conditions: RelA un-induced, No Dox (ND); Dox induced for
24 h; Dox induced for 72 h; Dox induced for 24 h then Dox withdrawn for 48 h. The
expression data was submitted to Gene Expression Ominibus (GEO) and the accession
number is GSE65040. Analysis of the data identified cross-talk between basal RelA
activity and the Interferon pathway mediated by IRF1, a target of RelA [5].
Activation of the Interferon pathway lead to down-regulation of CDK4 expression
resulting in RB1 hypo-phosphorylation and suppression of cell cycle progression. 
The tumor-suppressor activity of NF-kB, specifically RelA, may stem from
cross-talk with the Interferon pathway.

In invertebrates, small interfering RNAs are at the vanguard of cell-autonomous
antiviral immunity. In contrast, antiviral mechanisms initiated by interferon
(IFN) signaling predominate in mammals. Whilst mammalian IFN-induced miRNA are
known to inhibit specific viruses, it is not known whether host-directed
microRNAs, downstream of IFN-signaling, have a role in mediating broad antiviral 
resistance. By performing an integrative, systematic, global analysis of RNA
turnover utilizing 4-thiouridine labeling of newly transcribed RNA and
pri/pre-miRNA in IFN-activated macrophages, we identify a new
post-transcriptional viral defense mechanism mediated by miR-342-5p. On the basis
of ChIP and site-directed promoter mutagenesis experiments, we find the synthesis
of miR-342-5p is coupled to the antiviral IFN response via the IFN-induced
transcription factor, IRF1. Strikingly, we find miR-342-5p targets
mevalonate-sterol biosynthesis using a multihit mechanism suppressing the pathway
at different functional levels: transcriptionally via SREBF2,
post-transcriptionally via miR-33, and enzymatically via IDI1 and SC4MOL. Mass
spectrometry-based lipidomics and enzymatic assays demonstrate the targeting
mechanisms reduce intermediate sterol pathway metabolites and total cholesterol
in macrophages. These results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which
IFN regulates the sterol pathway. The sterol pathway is known to be an integral
part of the macrophage IFN antiviral response, and we show that miR-342-5p exerts
broad antiviral effects against multiple, unrelated pathogenic viruses such
Cytomegalovirus and Influenza A (H1N1). Metabolic rescue experiments confirm the 
specificity of these effects and demonstrate that unrelated viruses have
differential mevalonate and sterol pathway requirements for their replication.
This study, therefore, advances the general concept of broad antiviral defense
through multihit targeting of a single host pathway.

Immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) is one of the highest induced genes in macrophages
under pro-inflammatory conditions. Its function has been recently described: it
codes for immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase
(IRG1/CAD), an enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid from
cis-aconitic acid, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. Itaconic acid
possesses specific antimicrobial properties inhibiting isocitrate lyase, the
first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, an anaplerotic pathway that bypasses the
TCA cycle and enables bacteria to survive on limited carbon conditions. To
elucidate the mechanisms underlying itaconic acid production through IRG1
induction in macrophages, we examined the transcriptional regulation of IRG1. To 
this end, we studied IRG1 expression in human immune cells under different
inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFa and IFN<U+03B3>, in addition to lipopolysaccharides. 
Under these conditions, as previously shown in mouse macrophages, IRG1/CAD
accumulates in mitochondria. Furthermore, using literature information and
transcription factor prediction models, we re-constructed raw gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) for IRG1 in mouse and human macrophages. We further implemented a
contextualization algorithm that relies on genome-wide gene expression data to
infer putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions in mouse and human
macrophages, which allowed us to predict potential transcriptional regulators of 
IRG1. Among the computationally identified regulators, siRNA-mediated gene
silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in macrophages significantly
decreased the expression of IRG1/CAD at the gene and protein level, which
correlated with a reduced production of itaconic acid. Using a synergistic
approach of both computational and experimental methods, we here shed more light 
on the transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression and could pave the way to
therapeutic approaches targeting itaconic acid levels.

The ratio of monocytes and lymphocytes (ML ratio) in peripheral blood is
associated with tuberculosis and malaria disease risk and cancer and
cardiovascular disease outcomes. We studied anti-mycobacterial function and the
transcriptome of monocytes in relation to the ML ratio. Mycobacterial growth
inhibition assays of whole or sorted blood were performed and mycobacteria were
enumerated by liquid culture. Transcriptomes of unstimulated CD14 + monocytes
isolated by magnetic bead sorting were characterised by microarray. Transcript
expression was tested for association with ML ratio calculated from leucocyte
differential counts by linear regression. The ML ratio was associated with
mycobacterial growth in vitro (ß = 2.23, SE 0.91, p = 0.02). Using sorted
monocytes and lymphocytes, in vivo ML ratio (% variance explained R(2) = 11%,
p = 0.02) dominated over in vitro ratios (R(2) = 5%, p = 0.10) in explaining
mycobacterial growth. Expression of 906 genes was associated with the ML ratio
and 53 with monocyte count alone. ML-ratio associated genes were enriched for
type-I and -II interferon signalling (p = 1.2 × 10(- 8)), and for genes under
transcriptional control of IRF1, IRF2, RUNX1, RELA and ESRRB. The
ML-ratio-associated gene set was enriched in TB disease (3.11-fold, 95% CI:
2.28-4.19, p = 5.7 × 10(- 12)) and other inflammatory diseases including atopy,
HIV, IBD and SLE. The ML ratio is associated with distinct transcriptional and
anti-mycobacterial profiles of monocytes that may explain the disease
associations of the ML ratio.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver cancer that could be induced by
hepatitis C virus genotype 2a Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1 (JFH-1) strain. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of HCC. The
microarray data GSE20948 includes 14 JFH-1- and 14 mock (equal volume of medium
[control])-infected Huh7 samples. The data were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus. After data processing, soft cluster analyses were performed
to identify co-regulated genes with similar temporal expression patterns.
Functional and pathway enrichment analyses, as well as functional annotation
analysis, were performed. Subsequently, combined networks of protein-protein
interaction network, microRNA regulatory network, and transcriptional regulatory 
network were constructed. Hub nodes, modules, and five clusters of co-regulated
genes were also identified. In total, 173 up and 207 down co-regulated genes were
separately identified in JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells compared with those of control
cells. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that up co-regulated genes were
related to skeletal system morphogenesis and neuron differentiation and down
co-regulated genes were related to steroid/cholesterol/sterol metabolisms. Hub
genes (such as IRF1, GBP1, ICAM1, Foxa1, DHCR7, HMGCS2, and MSMO1) were
identified. Transcription factors IRF1 and Foxa1 were the targets of miR-130a,
miR-17-5p, and miR-20a. PPARGC1A was targeted by miR-29 family, and MSMO1 was the
target of miR-23 family. Hub nodes (such as IRF1, GBP1, ICAM1, Foxa1, DHCR7,
HMGCS2, and MSMO1) and microRNAs might be used as candidate biomarkers of
JFH-1-infected HCC.

BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause the majority of colds and trigger
exacerbations of chronic lower airway diseases. Airway epithelial cells are the
primary site for HRV infection and replication, and the initiation of host
inflammatory responses. At present, the molecular mechanisms that underpin HRV
responses in airway epithelial cells are incompletely understood. The aim of this
study was to employ microarray profiling, upstream regulator analysis, and siRNA 
mediated gene silencing to further our understanding of the role of interferon
regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in this response.
METHODS: Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) where transfected with
siRNA that targets IRF7 or a non-silencing control (all-star control) using
Lipofectamine. The cells were allowed to recover, and then cultured in the
presence or absence of HRV-16 for 24 h. Global patterns of gene expression were
profiled on microarrays. A subset of genes identified in the microarray study
were validated at the mRNA and/or protein level using real time RT-qPCR, ELISA,
and western blots.
RESULTS: Hundreds of genes were upregulated in HBE during HRV infection. Pathways
analysis demonstrated that these genes were mainly involved in type I and II
interferon signaling, RIG-I/MDA5 signaling, antigen processing and presentation, 
and apoptosis. Upstream regulator analysis of these data suggested that IRF7 was 
a major molecular driver of this response. Knockdown of IRF7 reduced the
HRV-driven upregulation of genes involved in antiviral responses (interferon
signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, RIG-I/MDA5 
signaling), and increased the expression of genes that promote inflammation (e.g.
CXCL5, IL-33, IL1RL1) and the response to oxidative stress. However, the majority
of genes that were perturbed by HRV in HBE cells including those that are known
to be regulated by IRF7 were insensitive to IRF7 knockdown. Upstream regulator
analysis of the part of the response that was insensitive to IRF7 knockdown
suggested it was driven by NF-<U+03BA>B, STAT1, STAT3, and IRF1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that IRF7 regulates the expression of genes
involved in antiviral immunity, inflammation, and the response to oxidative
stress during HRV infections in HBE cells, and also suggests that other
transcription factors play a major role in this response.

Hepatocyte apoptosis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated
hepatitis. However, the detailed mechanisms of apoptosis signaling are still
unclear and effective therapeutic drugs for hepatitis have been explored. Here,
we show that tryptophan (Trp) suppressed IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated hepatic apoptosis in
vitro. Trp inhibited the downstream apoptotic events of mitochondria disruption, 
such as cell death and caspase-3 activation, while it did not influence upstream 
signaling including STAT1 activation and IRF1 expression. Trp suppressed reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation at the mitochondria. IFN-<U+03B3> induced ROS in
mitochondria by inhibiting complex I and III, but not II. This ROS generation by 
IFN-<U+03B3> required de novo protein synthesis. Trp showed relatively weak direct
scavenging activity but antagonized IFN-<U+03B3> against the suppression of complex I.
In addition, Trp increased the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes
NQO1, HO-1 and GCS in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the
administration of Trp in an acetaminophen-induced ROS-dependent hepatitis model
suppressed the liver injury in vivo. Thus, Trp protects hepatocytes from
ROS-dependent cell injury via multiple pathways. This study suggests Trp as a
therapeutic antioxidant drug for hepatitis and a regulator for Nrf2-dependent
genes.

BACKGROUND: Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 10 was first found in birds and is
present in the genome of other tetrapods (but not humans and mice), as well as in
teleost fish. The functional role of IRF10 in vertebrate immunity is relatively
unknown compared to IRF1-9. The target of this research was to clone and
characterize the IRF10 genes in three economically important fish species that
will facilitate future evaluation of this molecule in fish innate and adaptive
immunity.
MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF IRF10 IN THREE FISH SPECIES: In the present study, 
a single IRF10 gene was cloned in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella and Asian
swamp eel Monopterus albus, and two, named IRF10a and IRF10b, in rainbow trout
Oncorhynchus mykiss. The fish IRF10 molecules share highest identities to other
vertebrate IRF10s, and have a well conserved DNA binding domain, IRF-associated
domain, and an 8 exon/7 intron structure with conserved intron phase. The
presence of an upstream ATG or open reading frame (ORF) in the 5'-untranslated
region of different fish IRF10 cDNA sequences suggests potential regulation at
the translational level, and this has been verified by in vitro
transcription/translation experiments of the trout IRF10a cDNA, but would still
need to be validated in fish cells.
EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF IRF10 IN VIVO AND IN VITRO: Both trout IRF10 paralogues
are highly expressed in thymus, blood and spleen but are relatively low in head
kidney and caudal kidney. Trout IRF10b expression is significantly higher than
IRF10a in integumentary tissues i.e. gills, scales, skin, intestine, adipose fin 
and tail fins, suggesting that IRF10b may be more important in mucosal immunity. 
The expression of both trout IRF10 paralogues is up-regulated by recombinant
IFN-<U+03B3>. The expression of the IRF10 genes is highly induced by Poly I:C in vitro
and in vivo, and by viral infection, but is less responsive to peptidoglycan and 
bacterial infection, suggesting an important role of fish IRF10 in antiviral
defense.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease well treated by
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The aim was to identify genes with a
predictive value for relapse-free survival after TKI cessation in CML patients.
We performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from six CML patients in long-lasting 
deep molecular remission. Patients were divided into two groups with relapse
(n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3) and without relapse (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3) after TKI discontinuation. We found variants 
in genes CYP1B1, ALPK2, and IRF1 in group of patients with relapse and one
variant in gene PARP9 in group of patients without relapse. We verified
prognostic value of the found markers in a small group of patients with TKI
discontinuation and demonstrated their high sensitivity (77%), specificity (86%),
positive (85%), and negative (79%) predictive values. Thus we revealed genetic
variants, which are potential markers of outcome prediction in CML patients after
TKI discontinuation.

The Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) family consists of multiple transcription 
factors involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes.
Originally identified as transcriptional regulators of the type I interferon
system, IRFs play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, cell growth,
differentiation and tumorigenesis. Hence, understanding IRF biology has important
implications in the host response to cancer development and progression. Many
lines of evidence suggest that different IRFs are involved in the pathogenesis of
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder caused by the
BCR-ABL oncoprotein. BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that 
favors cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and allows cell survival even in
the absence of proper adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Different BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently available for CML treatment. These drugs
are able to generate eight year CML-specific overall survival rates >90%, only a 
minority of patients will achieve molecular responses compatible with drug
discontinuation. Thus, there is an unmet need for additional therapeutic targets 
that may lead to the cure of most patients diagnosed with CML. A growing body of 
evidence has suggested a role for both IRF4 and IRF8 in the pathogenesis of CML. 
Furthermore, IRF1 is consistently deleted at one or both alleles in patients with
leukemia and myelodysplasia. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that IRF5 is 
a target of BCR-ABL kinase activity and reduces CML cell proliferation. In this
article, we provide an update on the current knowledge of the role of the IRFs in
CML.

Preterm birth is the largest single cause of neonatal death and morbidity. By
activating cytokine- and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling pathways, infection
and/or inflammation are strongly associated with preterm delivery. Interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) is an important regulator of the inflammatory
response. The aims of this study were to establish the effect of 1) labor on IRF1
expression in human fetal membranes and myometrium, 2) prolabor mediators on IRF1
expression and activity, and 3) IRF1 small interfering RNA on the expression of
prolabor mediators. IRF1 expression was higher in fetal membranes and myometrium 
after spontaneous term labor and in preterm fetal membranes with infection. The
proinflammatory cytokine IL1B, the bacterial product fsl-1, and viral analog
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly [I:C]) significantly increased IRF1 mRNA
expression and transcriptional activity in human primary myometrial cells. In
addition, IL1B increased IRF1 activity in primary amnion cells. IRF1 silencing in
myometrial cells decreased IL1B-, fsl-1-, and poly (I:C)-induced cytokine (IL6,
TNF, IL1B) and chemokine (CXCL8, CCL2) mRNA expression and IL6, CXCL8, and CCL2
release. IL1B-, fsl-1-, and poly (I:C)-induced PTGS2 mRNA expression and
IL1B-induced prostaglandin release was also decreased by IRF1 silencing. In
conclusion, IRF1 upregulation in fetal membranes and myometrium after term labor 
indicates a proinflammatory role for IRF1 in human parturition. IRF1 is involved 
in TLR- and cytokine-mediated signaling in human myometrium. These data provide
new insights into the mechanisms associated with inflammation- and
infection-associated preterm birth. IRF1 inhibitors as therapeutics for the
management of spontaneous preterm birth warrants further investigation.

Discovering condition specific topological pattern changes in coexpression
network: an application to HIV1 progression.

Ray S, Bandyopadhyay S.

The natural progression of HIV-1 begins with a short acute retroviral syndrome
which typically transit to chronic and clinical latency stages and subsequently
progresses to a symptomatic, life-threatening immunodeficiency disease known as
AIDS. Microarray analysis based on gene coexpression is widely used to
investigate the coregulation pattern of a group (or cluster) of genes in a
specific phenotype. Moreover, an investigation on the topological patterns across
multiple phenotypes can facilitate the understanding of stage specific infection 
pattern of HIV-1 virus. Here, we develop a novel framework to identify
topological patterns of gene coexpression network and detect changes of modular
structure across different stages of HIV progression. This is achieved by
comparing the topological and intramodular properties of HIV infection modules.
To capture the diversity in modular structure, some topological, correlation
based and eigengene based measures are utilized here. We have applied a rank
aggregation scheme to rank all the modules to provide a good agreement between
these measures. Some novel transcription factors like 'FOXO1','GATA3',
'GFI1','IRF1', 'IRF7', 'MAX', 'STAT1', 'STAT3', 'XBP1' and 'YY1' that emerge from
the modules show significant change in expression pattern over HIV progression
stages. Moreover, we have performed an eigengene based analysis to reveal the
perturbation in modular structure across three stages of HIV-1 progression.

INTRODUCTION: The kidney biopsy is used to diagnose and guide initial therapy in 
patients with lupus nephritis (LN). Kidney histology does not correlate well with
clinical measurements of kidney injury or predict how patients will respond to
standard-of-care immunosuppression. We postulated that the gene expression
profile of kidney tissue at the time of biopsy may differentiate patients who
will from those who will not respond to treatment.
METHODS: The expression of 511 immune-response genes was measured in kidney
biopsies from 19 patients with proliferative LN and 4 normal controls. RNA was
extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded kidney biopsies done at flare.
After induction therapy, 5 patients achieved a complete clinical response (CR),
10 had a partial response (PR) and 4 patients were non-responders (NRs).
Transcript expression was compared with normal controls and between renal
response groups.
RESULTS: A principal component analysis showed that intrarenal transcript
expression from normal kidney, CR biopsies and NR biopsies segregated from each
other. The top genes responsible for CR clustering included several interferon
pathway genes (STAT1, IRF1, IRF7, MX1, STAT2, JAK2), while complement genes (C1R,
C1QB, C6, C9, C5, MASP2) were mainly responsible for NR clustering. Overall, 35
genes were uniquely expressed in NR compared with CR. Pathway analysis revealed
that interferon signalling and complement activation pathways were upregulated in
both groups, while BAFF, APRIL, nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B and interleukin-6 signalling
were increased in CR but suppressed in NR.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that molecular profiling of the kidney biopsy at 
LN flare may be useful in predicting treatment response to induction therapy.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), as an important transcription factor, is
abundantly induced upon virus infections and participates in host antiviral
immune responses. However, the roles of porcine IRF1 (poIRF1) in host antiviral
defense remain poorly understood. In this study, we determined that poIRF1 was
upregulated upon infection with viruses and distributed in nucleus in porcine
PK-15 cells. Subsequently, we tested the antiviral activities of poIRF1 against
several swine viruses in cells. Overexpression of poIRF1 can efficiently suppress
the replication of viruses, and knockdown of poIRF1 promotes moderately viral
replication. Interestingly, overexpression of poIRF1 enhances dsRNA-induced IFN-ß
and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activation, whereas knockdown
of poIRF1 cannot significantly affect the activation of IFN-ß promoter induced by
RNA viruses. This study suggests that poIRF1 plays a significant role in cellular
antiviral response against swine viruses, but might be dispensable for IFN-ß
induction triggered by RNA viruses in PK-15 cells. Given these results, poIRF1
plays potential roles in cellular antiviral responses against swine viruses.

Distal regulatory element of the STAT1 gene potentially mediates positive
feedback control of STAT1 expression.

(1)Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical
Science, Faculty of Pharmacy, Musashino University, Nishitokyo, Tokyo, 202-8585, 
Japan.

We previously identified a distal regulatory element located approximately 5.5-kb
upstream of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gene, 
thereafter designating it as 5.5-kb upstream regulatory region (5.5URR). In this 
study, we investigated the functional roles of 5.5URR in the transcriptional
regulation of STAT1 gene. A chromosome conformation capture assay indicated
physical interaction of 5.5URR with the STAT1 core promoter. In luciferase
reporter assays, 5.5URR-combined STAT1 core promoter exhibited significant
increase in reporter activity enhanced by forced STAT1 expression or interferon
(IFN) treatment, but STAT1 core promoter alone did not. The 5.5URR contained
IFN-stimulated response element and GAS sites, which bound STAT1 complexes in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistently, chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays of HEK293 cells with Halo-tagged STAT1
expression indicated the association of Halo-tagged STAT1 with 5.5URR. ChIP
assays with IFN treatment demonstrated that IFNs promoted the recruitment of
Halo-tagged STAT1 to 5.5URR. Forced STAT1 expression or IFN treatment increased
the expression of endogenous STAT1 and other IFN signaling pathway components,
such as STAT2, IRF9 and IRF1, besides IFN-responsive genes. Collectively, the
results suggest that 5.5URR may provide a regulatory platform for positive
feedback control of STAT1 expression possibly to amplify or sustain the
intracellular IFN signals.

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome
(pSS) are typically characterized by the presence of autoantibodies and an
IFN-signature. The strength of the IFN-signature positively correlates with
disease severity, suggesting that type I IFNs are active players in these
diseases. BAFF is a cytokine critical for development and proper selection of B
cells, and the targeting of BAFF has emerged as a successful treatment strategy
of SLE. Previous reports have suggested that BAFF expression is directly induced 
by type I IFNs, but the precise mechanism for this remains unknown. In this
article, we demonstrate that BAFF is a bona fide ISG and that IFN regulatory
factors (IRFs) control the expression of BAFF. We identify IRF1 and IRF2 as
positive regulators of BAFF transcription and IRF4 and IRF8 as potent repressors;
in addition, we have mapped the precise binding site for these factors in the
BAFF promoter. IFN-ß injections induced BAFF expression mainly in neutrophils and
monocytes, and BAFF expression in neutrophils from pSS patients strongly
correlated with the strength of the IFN-signature. In summary, we show that BAFF 
expression is directly induced by type I IFNs via IRF1 and IRF2, whereas IRF4 and
IRF8 are negative regulators of BAFF expression. These data suggest that type I
IFN blockade in SLE and pSS patients will lead to downregulation of BAFF and a
consequential reduction of autoreactive B cell clones and autoantibodies.

Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), also called IPS-1/VISA/Cardif, 
is an important molecule involved in host defense and triggers a signal for
producing type I IFN. Currently the function of MAVS in ducks (duMAVS) remains
largely unclear while significant progress has been made in mammals. In this
study, the full-length duMAVS cDNA was cloned from duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs)
for the first time. Tissue specificity analysis showed duMAVS was universally
expressed in all detected tissues. DEFs transfected with duMAVS were able to
induce interferon-ß (IFN-ß) expression through activating interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B). Both the CARD-like domain and
transmembrane domain were required for duMAVS signaling via deletion mutant
analysis. In addition, poly(I:C)- or Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-ß expression 
in DEFs were significantly decreased by knock-down of duMAVS with siRNA.
Altogether, these results indicate that MAVS is a critical immunoregulator in
duck innate immune system.

The IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family encodes transcription factors that play
important roles in immune defense, stress response, reproduction, development,
and carcinogenesis. Although the origin of the IRF family has been dated back to 
multicellular organisms, invertebrate IRFs differ from vertebrate IRFs in genomic
structure and gene synteny, and little is known about their functions. Through
comparison of multiple amphioxus genomes, in this study we suggested that
amphioxus contains nine IRF members, whose orthologs are supposed to be shared
among three amphioxus species. As the orthologs to the vertebrate IRF1 and IRF4
subgroups, Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense (bbt)IRF1 and bbtIRF8 bind the
IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and were upregulated when amphioxus
intestinal cells were stimulated with poly(I:C). As amphioxus-specific IRFs, both
bbtIRF3 and bbtIRF7 bind ISRE. When activated, they can be phosphorylated by
bbtTBK1 and then translocate into nucleus for target gene transcription. As
transcriptional repressors, bbtIRF2 and bbtIRF4 can inhibit the transcriptional
activities of bbtIRF1, 3, 7, and 8 by competing for the binding of ISRE.
Interestingly, amphioxus IRF2, IRF8, and Rel were identified as target genes of
bbtIRF1, bbtIRF7, and bbtIRF3, respectively, suggesting a dynamic feedback
regulation among amphioxus IRF and NF-<U+03BA>B. Collectively, to our knowledge we
present for the first time an archaic IRF signaling framework in a basal
chordate, shedding new insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrate
IFN-based antiviral networks.

Genome-wide association studies have previously identified 23 genetic loci
associated with circulating fibrinogen concentration. These studies used HapMap
imputation and did not examine the X-chromosome. 1000 Genomes imputation provides
better coverage of uncommon variants, and includes indels. We conducted a
genome-wide association analysis of 34 studies imputed to the 1000 Genomes
Project reference panel and including ~120 000 participants of European ancestry 
(95 806 participants with data on the X-chromosome). Approximately 10.7 million
single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 1.2 million indels were examined. We
identified 41 genome-wide significant fibrinogen loci; of which, 18 were newly
identified. There were no genome-wide significant signals on the X-chromosome.
The lead variants of five significant loci were indels. We further identified six
additional independent signals, including three rare variants, at two previously 
characterized loci: FGB and IRF1. Together the 41 loci explain 3% of the variance
in plasma fibrinogen concentration.

BACKGROUND: Viral infection causes multiple forms of human cancer, and HPV
infection is the primary factor in cervical carcinomas. Recent single-cell
RNA-seq studies highlight the tumor heterogeneity present in most cancers, but
virally induced tumors have not been studied. HeLa is a well characterized HPV+
cervical cancer cell line.
RESULT: We developed a new high throughput platform to prepare single-cell RNA on
a nanoliter scale based on a customized microwell chip. Using this method, we
successfully amplified full-length transcripts of 669 single HeLa S3 cells and 40
of them were randomly selected to perform single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on
these data, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity of
HeLa S3 cells in gene expression, alternative splicing and fusions. Furthermore, 
we identified a high diversity of HPV-18 expression and splicing at the
single-cell level. By co-expression analysis we identified 283 E6, E7
co-regulated genes, including CDC25, PCNA, PLK4, BUB1B and IRF1 known to interact
with HPV viral proteins.
CONCLUSION: Our results reveal the heterogeneity of a virus-infected cell line.
It not only provides a transcriptome characterization of HeLa S3 cells at the
single cell level, but is a demonstration of the power of single cell RNA-seq
analysis of virally infected cells and cancers.

Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) belong to a family of transcription factor
involved in transcriptional regulation of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes
(ISG) in cells. In the present study, an IRF3 full-length cDNA (termed CiIRF3,
JX999055) and its promoter sequence were cloned by homology cloning strategy and 
genome walking from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The full-length cDNA
sequence of CiIRF3 is comprised of a 5'UTR (195 bp), a 3'UTR (269 bp) and a
largest open reading frame (ORF) of 1377 bp encoding a polypeptide of 458 amino
acids. CiIRF3 has a conservative DNA-binding domain (DBD) at N-terminal and a
relatively conserved interferon regulatory factors association domain (IAD).
Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that CiIRF3 gathers together with other
IRF-3 from higher vertebrates in the same branch. The promoter sequence of CiIRF3
(596 bp) consists of three IRF-E, a C/EBP beta, a NF-kappa B and a TATA-BOX.
CiIRF3 was constitutively expressed at low level in different grass carp tissues 
but was rapidly up-regulated with Poly I:C stimulation. To study the molecular
mechanism of CiIRF3 regulating the transcription of IRFs, CiIRF3 was expressed in
Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA
His-Bind Resin. Gel mobility shift assays revealed the affinity of CiIRF3 protein
with promoters of CiIRF1, CiIRF2, CiIRF3 and CiIRF7 respectively. Then, CIK cells
were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-CiIRF3, pGL3-promotor (pGL3-CiIRF1,
pGL3-CiIRF2, pGL3-CiIRF3, pGL3-CiIRF7) and luciferase reporter vector
respectively. The cotransfection experiment showed that CiIRF3 increased the
promoter activity of CiIRF1, CiIRF2, CiIRF3 and CiIRF7. Furthermore,
overexpression of CiIRF3 in CIK cells also up-regulated the expressions of
CiIRF1, CiIRF2, CiIRF3 and CiIRF7. So, CiIRF3 can improve the transcriptional
level of CiIRF1, CiIRF2, CiIRF3 and CiIRF7.

Macrophages are actively involved in inflammatory responses during the
progression of cardiac injury, including myocardial infarction (MI). A previous
study showed that 5-azacytidine (5AZ), a DNA methylation inhibitor, can
ameliorate cardiac injury by shifting macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory
phenotype via iNOS inhibition. Here, we show that the beneficial effect of 5AZ is
associated with sumoylation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) in
macrophages. IRF1 is a critical transcription factor for iNOS induction and is
antagonized by IRF2. In the stimulated macrophages, IRF1 accumulated in the
nucleus without degradation by 5AZ treatment. In animal study, 5AZ administration
resulted in significant improvements in cardiac function and fibrosis.
IRF1-expressing macrophages were more abundant in the 5AZ-treated MI group than
in the PBS-treated MI group. Because sumoylated IRF1 is known to mimic IRF2, we
examined the IRF1 sumoylation. Sumoylated IRF1 was resistant to degradation and
significantly increased in the 5AZ-treated MI group. Collectively, 5AZ had a
protective effect after MI by potentiation of IRF1 sumoylation and is suggested
as a novel therapeutic intervention for cardiac repair.

BACKGROUND: Francisella infection attenuates immune cell infiltration and
expression of selected pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to endogenous LPS, 
suggesting the bacteria is actively antagonizing at least some part of the
response to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) engagement. The ability of different
Francisella strains to inhibit the ability of E. coli LPS to induce a pulmonary
inflammatory response, as measured by gene expression profiling, was examined to 
define the scope of modulation and identify of inflammatory genes/pathways that
are specifically antagonized by a virulent F. tularensis infection.
RESULTS: Prior aerosol exposure to F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, but not the
live attenuated strain (LVS) of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica or F. novicida,
significantly antagonized the transcriptional response in the lungs of infected
mice exposed to aerosolized E. coli LPS. The response to E. coli LPS was not
completely inhibited, suggesting that the bacteria is targeting further
downstream of the TLR4 molecule. Analysis of the promotors of LPS-responsive
genes that were perturbed by Type A Francisella infection identified candidate
transcription factors that were potentially modulated by the bacteria, including 
multiple members of the forkhead transcription factor family (FoxA1, Foxa2,
FoxD1, Foxd3, Foxf2, FoxI1, Fox03, Foxq1), IRF1, CEBPA, and Mef2. The annotated
functional roles of the affected genes suggested that virulent Francisella
infection suppressed cellular processes including mRNA processing, antiviral
responses, intracellular trafficking, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
Surprisingly, despite the broad overall suppression of LPS-induced genes by
virulent Francisella, and contrary to what was anticipated from prior studies,
Type A Francisella did not inhibit the expression of the majority of LPS-induced 
cytokines, nor the expression of many classic annotated inflammatory genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this analysis demonstrates clear differences in the
ability of different Francisella strains to modulate TLR4 signaling and
identifies genes/pathways that are specifically targeted by virulent Type A
Francisella.

Three inactivated EV71 whole-virus vaccines have completed Phase III clinical
trials in mainland China, with high efficacy, satisfactory safety, and sustained 
immunogenicity. However, the molecular mechanisms how this new vaccine elicit
potent immune response remain poorly understood. To characterize the primary and 
recall responses to EV71 vaccines, PBMC from 19 recipients before and after
vaccination with EV71 vaccine are collected and their gene expression signatures 
after stimulation with EV71 antigen were compared. The results showed that
primary and recall response to EV71 antigen have both activated an IRF7
regulating type I interferon and antiviral immune response network. However,
up-regulated genes involved in T cell activation regulated by IRF1, inflammatory 
response, B-cell activation and humoral immune response were only observed in
recall response. The specific secretion of IL-10 in primary response and
IL-2,IP-10,CCL14a, CCL21 in recall response was consistent with the activation of
immune response process found in genes. Furthermore, the expression of MX1 and
secretion of IP-10 in recall response were strongly correlated with NTAb level at
180d after vaccination (r = 0.81 and 0.99). In summary, inflammatory response,
adaptive immune response and a stronger antiviral response were indentified in
recall response.

Human (Homo sapiens) micro-RNAs (hsa-miRNAs) regulate virus and host-gene
translation, but the biological impact in patients with human cytomegalovirus
(hCMV) infection is not well defined in a clinically relevant model. First, we
compared hsa-miRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
35 transplant recipients with and without CMV viremia by using a microarray chip 
covering 847 hsa-miRNAs. This approach demonstrated a set of 142 differentially
expressed hsa-miRNAs. Next, we examined the effect of each of these miRNAs on
viral growth by using human fibroblasts (human foreskin fibroblast-1) infected
with the hCMV Towne strain, identifying a subset of proviral and antiviral
hsa-miRNAs. miRNA-target prediction software indicated potential binding sites
within the hCMV genome (e.g., hCMV-UL52 and -UL100 [UL<U+2009>=<U+2009>unique long]) and
host-genes (e.g., interleukin-1 receptor, IRF1). Luciferase-expressing plasmid
constructs and immunoblotting confirmed several predicted miRNA targets. Finally,
we determined the expression of selected proviral and antiviral hsa-miRNAs in 242
transplant recipients with hCMV-viremia. We measured hsa-miRNAs before and after 
antiviral therapy and correlated hsa-miRNA expression levels to hCMV-replication 
dynamics. One of six antiviral hsa-miRNAs showed a significant increase during
treatment, concurrent with viral decline. In contrast, six of eight proviral
hsa-miRNAs showed a decrease during viral decline. Our results indicate that a
complex and multitargeted hsa-miRNA response occurs during CMV replication in
immunosuppressed patients. This study provides mechanistic insight and potential 
novel biomarkers for CMV replication.

Both oncogenic and tumor-suppressor activities are attributed to the Nuclear
Factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, NF-kB may positively or negatively
regulate proliferation. The molecular determinants of these opposing roles of
NF-kB are unclear. Using primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) as a
model, we show that increased RelA levels and consequent increase in basal
transcriptional activity of RelA induces IRF1, a target gene. Induced IRF1
upregulates STAT1 and IRF7, and in consort, these factors induce the expression
of interferon response genes. Activation of the interferon pathway down-regulates
CDK4 and up-regulates p27 resulting in Rb hypo-phosphorylation and cell cycle
arrest. Stimulation of HMEC with IFN-<U+03B3> elicits similar phenotypic and molecular
changes suggesting that basal activity of RelA and IFN-<U+03B3> converge on IRF1 to
regulate proliferation. The anti-proliferative RelA-IRF1-CDK4 signaling axis is
retained in ER+/HER2- breast tumors analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Using immuno-histochemical analysis of breast tumors, we confirm the negative
correlation between RelA levels and proliferation rate in ER+/HER2- breast
tumors. These findings attribute an anti-proliferative tumor-suppressor role to
basal RelA activity. Inactivation of Rb, down-regulation of RelA or IRF1, or
upregulation of CDK4 or IRF2 rescues the RelA-IRF1-CDK4 induced proliferation
arrest in HMEC and are points of disruption in aggressive tumors. Activity of the
RelA-IRF1-CDK4 axis may explain favorable response to CDK4/6 inhibition observed 
in patients with ER+ Rb competent tumors.

Catalyzing the deamination of adenosine to inosine in RNA, ADAR1 (adenosine
deaminase that act on RNA 1) belongs to ADAR family. In our previous work, we
have cloned the complete genomic sequence of ADAR1 from grass carp
(Ctenopharyngodon idella), named CiADAR1. In the process, we found a splicing
isoform of CiADAR1 (CiADAR1-like). CiADAR1 and CiADAR1-like are possessed by
different promoters but share a common exon 2. The complete genomic CiADAR1-like 
has 9 exons and 8 introns. Its full-length cDNA is comprised of a 5' UTR (417
bp), a 3' UTR (118 bp) and a 3324 bp-long ORF encoding a polypeptide of 1107
amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of CiADAR1-like contains two Z-DNA
binding domains, three dsRNA binding motifs and a truncate catalytic domain.
CiADAR1-like shared higher homology with Danio rerio ADAR1 and lower homology
with HsADAR1-like in phylogenetic tree. qRT-PCR showed that CiADAR1-like were
ubiquitously expressed and significantly up-regulated after stimulation with Poly
I:C. Its mRNA reached the peak at 12 h post-stimulation in all tested tissues.
Western-blotting experiment proved CiADAR1-like was factually expressed in C.
idella kidney (CIK) cells. To further study the transcriptional regulatory
mechanism of CiADAR1-like, we cloned its promoter sequence. CiADAR1-like promoter
is 1173 bp in length containing 3 ISRE and 8 IRF-E. Subsequently, grass carp IRF1
(CiIRF1) and IRF3 (CiIRF3) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified
by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin. In vitro, CiIRF1 and
CiIRF3 were able to bind to CiADAR1-like promoter with high affinity in gel
mobility shift assays, revealing that IRF1 and IRF3 could be the potential
transcriptional regulatory factors for CiADAR1-like. In vivo, Co-transfection of 
pcDNA3.1-IRF1 (or pcDNA3.1-IRF3) with pGL3-CiADAR1-like promoter into CIK cells
showed that both IRF1 and IRF3 significantly increased the luciferase activity,
suggesting that they play a positive role in CiADAR1-like transcription.

OBJECTIVE: Histone modifications set transcriptional competency and can
perpetuate pathologic expression patterns. We defined systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE)-specific changes in H3K4me3 and K3K27me3, histone marks of
gene activation and repression, respectively.
METHODS: We used ChIP-seq to define histone modifications in monocytes from SLE
patients and controls.
RESULTS: Both promoters and enhancers exhibited significant changes in histone
methylation in SLE. Regions with differential H3K4me3 in SLE were significantly
enriched in potential interferon-related transcription factor binding sites and
pioneer transcription factor sites.
CONCLUSION: Enhancer activation defines the character of the cell and our data
support extensive disease effects in monocytes, a particularly plastic lineage.
Type I interferons not only drive altered gene expression but may also alter the 
character of the cell through chromatin modifications.

Super-enhancers (SEs), which are composed of large clusters of enhancers densely 
loaded with the Mediator complex, transcription factors and chromatin regulators,
drive high expression of genes implicated in cell identity and disease, such as
lineage-controlling transcription factors and oncogenes. BRD4 and CDK7 are
positive regulators of SE-mediated transcription. By contrast, negative
regulators of SE-associated genes have not been well described. Here we show that
the Mediator-associated kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and CDK19
restrain increased activation of key SE-associated genes in acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) cells. We report that the natural product cortistatin A (CA)
selectively inhibits Mediator kinases, has anti-leukaemic activity in vitro and
in vivo, and disproportionately induces upregulation of SE-associated genes in
CA-sensitive AML cell lines but not in CA-insensitive cell lines. In AML cells,
CA upregulated SE-associated genes with tumour suppressor and lineage-controlling
functions, including the transcription factors CEBPA, IRF8, IRF1 and ETV6 (refs
6-8). The BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 downregulated these SE-associated genes, yet
also has anti-leukaemic activity. Individually increasing or decreasing the
expression of these transcription factors suppressed AML cell growth, providing
evidence that leukaemia cells are sensitive to the dosage of SE-associated genes.
Our results demonstrate that Mediator kinases can negatively regulate
SE-associated gene expression in specific cell types, and can be
pharmacologically targeted as a therapeutic approach to AML.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is functionally diverse in the regulation
of immune response and is considered to be an important candidate gene for
studying disease susceptibility in mammals. In this paper, we characterized the
whole sequence of the IRF1 gene in river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and compared
genomic and the amino acid sequences between different species. The buffalo IRF1 
gene was 7099 bp long and organized into 10 exons and nine introns. Its molecular
structure showed exactly the same number of exons (10) and introns (nine) in
bovids, mice, horses, humans, and chickens. However, rats did not have exon 5,
but had the largest exon 4, which suggests that exon 5 was incorporated into exon
4. The coding and the amino acid sequences of the gene showed that identity
varied from 73 to 99% at the coding sequence level and from 61 to 100% at the
amino acid level when compared with other mammals and chickens. Comparative
analysis of the gene sequence between two different buffalo breeds, Murrah and
Mediterranean, revealed six potential SNPs that are primarily located in the 5'
and 3'UTRs.

BACKGROUND: Cancers adapt to immune-surveillance through evasion. Immune
responses against carcinoma and melanoma converge on cytotoxic effectors and
IFN<U+03B3>-STAT1-IRF1 signalling. Local IFN-driven immune checkpoint expression can
mediate feedback inhibition and adaptive immune resistance. Whether such coupled 
immune polarization and adaptive resistance is generalisable to lymphoid
malignancies is incompletely defined. The host response in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL), the commonest aggressive lymphoid malignancy, provides an
empirical model.
METHODS: Using ten publicly available gene expression data sets encompassing 2030
cases we explore the nature of host response in DLBCL. Starting from the "cell of
origin" paradigm for DLBCL classification, we use the consistency of differential
expression to define polarized patterns of immune response genes in DLBCL, and
derive a linear classifier of immune response gene expression. We validate and
extend the results in an approach independent of "cell of origin" classification 
based on gene expression correlations across all data sets.
RESULTS: T-cell and cytotoxic gene expression with polarization along the
IFN<U+03B3>-STAT1-IRF1 axis provides a defining feature of the immune response in DLBCL.
This response is associated with improved outcome, particularly in the germinal
centre B-cell subsets of DLBCL. Analysis of gene correlations across all data
sets, independent of "cell of origin" class, demonstrates a consistent
association with a hierarchy of immune-regulatory gene expression that places
IDO1, LAG3 and FGL2 ahead of PD1-ligands CD274 and PDCD1LG2.
CONCLUSION: Immune responses in DLBCL converge onto the IFN<U+03B3>-STAT1-IRF1 axis and 
link to diverse potential mediators of adaptive immune resistance identifying
future therapeutic targets.

PURPOSE: Antiangiogenic therapy is commonly being used for the treatment of
glioblastoma. However, the benefits of angiogenesis inhibitors are typically
transient and resistance often develops. Determining the mechanism of treatment
failure of the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab for malignant glioma would
provide insight into approaches to overcome therapeutic resistance.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we evaluated the effects of bevacizumab on
the autophagy of glioma cells and determined target genes involving in the
regulation of bevacizumab-induced autophagy.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that bevacizumab treatment increased expression of
autophagy markers and autophagosome formation in cell culture experiments as well
as in in vivo studies. Gene expression profile analysis performed on murine
xenograft models of glioblastoma showed increased transcriptional levels of
STAT1/IRF1 signaling in bevacizumab resistant tumors compared to control tumors. 
In vitro experiments showed that bevacizumab treatment increased IRF1 expression 
in a dose and time dependent manner, which was coincident with
bevacizumab-mediated autophagy. Down regulation of IRF1 by shRNA blocked
autophagy and increased AIF-dependent apoptosis in bevacizumab-treated glioma
cells. Consistently, IRF1 depletion increased the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy
in a glioma xenograft model, which was due to less bevacizumab-promoted autophagy
and increased apoptosis in tumors with down-regulated IRF1.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that IRF1 may regulate bevacizumab-induced
autophagy, and may be one important mediator of glioblastoma resistant to
bevacizumab.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe respiratory
illness in children and susceptible adults. RSV blocks the development of the
innate antiviral immune response and can grow to high titers in the respiratory
tract. Here we demonstrate that immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (iDVGs)
that are naturally generated during RSV replication are strong inducers of the
innate antiviral response to RSV in mice and humans. In mice, RSV iDVGs
stimulated the expression of antiviral genes, restricted viral replication, and
prevented weight loss and lung inflammation. In human cells, the antiviral
response to RSV iDVGs was dominated by the expression of IFN-<U+03BB>1 over IFN-ß and
was driven by rapid intranuclear accumulation of the transcription factor IRF1.
RSV iDVGs were detected in respiratory secretions of hospitalized patients, and
their amount positively correlated with the level of expression of antiviral
genes in the samples. Infection of explanted human lung tissue from different
donors revealed that most humans can respond to RSV iDVGs and that the rate of
accumulation of iDVGs during infection directly correlates with the quality of
the antiviral response. Taken together, our data establish iDVGs as primary
triggers of robust antiviral responses to RSV and provide the first evidence for 
an important biological role for naturally occurring iDVGs during a paramyxovirus
infection in humans.

Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) plays a crucial role in the transformation 
of microglia to a reactive state by regulating the expression of various genes.
In the present study, we show that IRF1 is required for IRF8-induced gene
expression in microglia. Peripheral nerve injury induced IRF1 gene upregulation
in the spinal microglia in an IRF8-dependent manner. IRF8 transduction in
cultured microglia induced de novo gene expression of IRF1. Importantly,
knockdown of the IRF1 gene in IRF8-transduced microglia prevented upregulation of
interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). Therefore, our findings suggest that expression of IL-1ß 
is dependent on IRF1 in IRF8-expressing reactive microglia.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, 
is still a threat to mankind due to treatment failure, drug resistance and
coinfection with HIV. The limitations of first-line drugs have led to the
development of new strategies to combat this dreaded disease. Recently, we have
shown the immunomodulatory property of Ara-LAM, a TLR2 ligand, against
leishmanial pathogenesis. In this study, we have extended our study to the effect
of Ara-LAM on regulatory T cells in a murine model of VL. We observed that
Ara-LAM-treated infected BALB/c mice showed a strong host-protective Th1 immune
response due to reduced IL-10 and TGF-ß production, along with marked decrease in
CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) GITR(+) CTLA4(+) regulatory T cell (Treg) generation and 
activation. The reduction in Foxp3 expression was due to effective modulation of 
TGF-ß-induced SMAD signaling in Treg cells by Ara-LAM. Moreover, we demonstrated 
that Ara-LAM-induced IRF1 expression in the Treg cells, which negatively
regulated foxp3 gene transcription, resulting in the reduced immunosuppressive
activity of Treg cells. Interestingly, irf1 gene knockdown completely abrogated
the effect of Ara-LAM on Treg cells. Thus, these findings provide detailed
mechanistic insight into Ara-LAM-mediated modulation of Treg cells, which might
be helpful in combating VL.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Uterine leiomyosarcoma (Ut-LMS) is a highly metastatic smooth
muscle neoplasm. We have previously reported that low molecular mass protein2
Lmp2-deficient mice spontaneously developed Ut-LMS, which implicated this protein
as an anti-oncogenic candidate. We also suggested that LMP2 may negatively
regulate Ut-LMS independently of its role in the proteasome. Initially described 
as a transcription factor able to activate the expression of interferon-gamma
(IFN-<U+03B3>)-responsive genes, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) has been shown to
play roles in the immune response, and tumor suppression. The aim of this study
was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of sarcomagenesis of Ut-LMS using human 
and mouse uterine tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of the IFN-<U+03B3> signal molecules, IRF1 and -2,
STAT1, and LMP2, -3, -7 and -10 were examined by western blot analysis,
electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemistry in human and mouse 
uterine tissues. Physiological significance of IRF1 in sarcomagenesis of Ut-LMS
was demonstrated by xenograft studies.
RESULTS: In the present study, several lines of evidence indicated that although 
treatment with IFN-<U+03B3> strongly induced the activation of STAT1 as a
transcriptional activator, its target molecule, IRF1, was not clearly produced in
Lmp2-deficient uterine smooth muscle cells (Ut-SMCs).
CONCLUSION: Defective expression of IRF1 in the IFN-<U+03B3>-induced signaling molecules
may result in the malignant transformation of Ut-SMCs. The modulation of LMP2 may
lead to new therapeutic approaches in human Ut-LMS.

neuronal disorders.

Pandemic influenza remains as a substantial threat to humans with a widespread
panic worldwide. In contrast, seasonal (non-pandemic) has a mild non-lethal
infection each year. The underlying mechanisms governing the detrimental effects 
of pandemic influenza are yet to be known. Transcriptomic-based network discovery
and gene ontology (GO) analysis of host response to pandemic influenza, compared 
to seasonal influenza, can shed light on the differential mechanisms which
pandemic influenza is employed during evolution. Here, using microarray data of
infected ferrets with pandemic and seasonal influenza (as a model), we evaluated 
the possible link between altered genes after pandemic infection with activation 
of neuronal disorders. To this end, we utilized novel computational biology
techniques including differential transcriptome analysis, network construction,
GO enrichment, and GO network to investigate the underlying mechanisms of
pandemic influenza infection and host interaction. In comparison to seasonal
influenza, pandemic influenza differentially altered the expression of 31 genes
with direct involvement in activity of central nervous system (CNS). Network
topology highlighted the high interactions of IRF1, NKX2-1 and NR5A1 as well as
MIR27A, MIR19A, and MIR17. TGFB2, NCOA3 and SP1 were the central transcription
factors in the networks. Pandemic influenza remarkably downregulated GPM6A and
GTPase. GO network demonstrated the key roles of GPM6A and GTPase in regulation
of important functions such as synapse assembly and neuron projection. For the
first time, we showed that besides interference with cytokine/chemokine storm and
neuraminidase enzyme, H1N1 pandemic influenza is able to directly affect neuronal
gene networks. The possibility of application of some key regulators such as
GPM6A protein, MIR128, and MIR367 as candidate therapeutic agents is discussed.
The presented approach established a new way to unravel unknown pathways in
virus-associated CNS dysfunction by utilizing global transcriptomic data, network
and GO analysis.

The concept of interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) having a central role in cell-mediated immune
defence to Mycobacterium tuberculosis has long been proposed. Observations made
through early candidate gene studies of constituents of the IFN-<U+03B3> pathway have
identified moderately associated variants associated with resistance or
susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). By analysing 20 major genes whose proteins
contribute to IFN-<U+03B3> signalling we have assessed a large fraction of the
variability in genes that might contribute to susceptibility to TB. Genetic
variants were identified by sequencing the promoter regions and all exons of
IFNG, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IRF1, IL12A, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL12RB2, IL23A, IL23R, IL27,
EBI3, IL27RA, IL6ST, SOCS1, STAT1, STAT4, JAK2, TYK2 and TBX21 in 69 DNA samples 
from Ghana. In addition, we screened all exons of IFNGR1 in a Ghanaian study
group comprising 1999 TB cases and 2589 controls by high-resolution melting point
analysis. The fine-mapping approach allows for a detailed screening of all
variants, common and rare. Statistical comparisons of cases and controls,
however, did not yield significant results after correction for multiple testing 
with any of the 246 variants selected for genotyping in this investigation.
Gene-wise haplotype tests and analysis of rare variants did not reveal any
significant association with susceptibility to TB in our investigation as well.
Although this analysis was applied on a plausible set of IFN-<U+03B3> pathway genes in
the largest African TB cohort available so far, the lack of significant results
challenges the view that genetic marker of the IFN-<U+03B3> pathway have an important
impact on susceptibility to TB.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online

Endotoxin tolerance is characterized by diminished expression of inflammatory
cytokines after sequential exposure to Toll-like receptor stimuli. Many
mechanisms contribute to tolerance; however, chromatin remodeling appears to be
the most significant regulator. The type II interferon, IFN-<U+03B3>, has been
recognized as being able to reverse or abrogate the establishment of tolerance.
Type I interferons have not been investigated previously, and they bind a
distinct receptor. We found that a2-interferon was able to abrogate or diminish
tolerance by endotoxin, as defined by measuring mRNA levels at recognized
tolerance targets. We also found that a2-interferon treatment during tolerization
was associated with increased H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 levels at promoters of
tolerance targets in THP1 cells. These marks were normalized after exposure of
the cells to a2-interferon. Interferon regulatory factor 1 is a transcription
factor activated and induced by types I and II interferons. We found recruitment 
of this transcription factor paralleled tolerance and inhibition of tolerance at 
target genes. Therefore, there are at least 2 distinct pathways by which
endotoxin tolerance may be mitigated. A type I interferon, in spite of binding to
a different receptor, was just as able to inhibit tolerance as the type II
interferon and also appeared to act by modifying chromatin at tolerance target
genes.

Aging deteriorates immunity. However, if aging affects immunity in an asymmetric 
or symmetric way remains largely unknown. In this study we clearly demonstrate
that compared with adult fish, the anti-viral responses of aged annual fish
Nothobranchius guentheri, as reflected by the expression levels of
virus-responsive genes, including lgp2 and mda5 encoding sensor molecules, ifn-i 
and viperin encoding the effector molecules and irf1, irf7, stat1 and atf3
encoding the regulation elements, are either reduced remarkably or elevated
markedly or show little difference depending upon the different tissues.
Moreover, although challenge with poly(I:C) results in a significant decrease in 
the expression of virus-responsive genes in most tissues of aged N. guentheri, it
also causes a considerable increase in the expression of the genes in other
tissues of aged fish. Collectively, these data suggest that the anti-viral
responses of the annual fish N. guentheri generally reduces with age in an
asymmetric way among the most tissues.

Infection of cells with DNA viruses triggers innate immune responses mediated by 
DNA sensors. cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a key DNA sensor that produces the
cyclic dinucleotide cGMP-AMP (cGAMP) upon activation, which binds to and
activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING), leading to IFN production and
an antiviral response. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a DNA
virus that is linked to several human malignancies. We report that KSHV infection
activates the cGAS-STING pathway, and that cGAS and STING also play an important 
role in regulating KSHV reactivation from latency. We screened KSHV proteins for 
their ability to inhibit this pathway and identified six viral proteins that
block IFN-ß activation through this pathway. This study is the first report
identifying multiple viral proteins encoded by a human DNA virus that inhibit the
cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway. One such protein, viral interferon regulatory
factor 1 (vIRF1), targets STING by preventing it from interacting with TANK
binding kinase 1 (TBK1), thereby inhibiting STING's phosphorylation and
concomitant activation, resulting in an inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway.
Our data provide a unique mechanism for the negative regulation of STING-mediated
DNA sensing. Moreover, the depletion of vIRF1 in the context of KSHV infection
prevented efficient viral reactivation and replication, and increased the host
IFN response to KSHV. The vIRF1-expressing cells also inhibited IFN-ß production 
following infection with DNA pathogens. Collectively, our results demonstrate
that gammaherpesviruses encode inhibitors that block cGAS-STING-mediated
antiviral immunity, and that modulation of this pathway is important for viral
transmission and the lifelong persistence of herpesviruses in the human
population.

Several mechanisms are involved in controlling intracellular survival of
pathogenic mycobacteria in host macrophages, but how these mechanisms are
regulated remains poorly understood. We report a role for Kelch-like
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), an oxidative stress sensor, in regulating
inflammation induced by infection with Mycobacterium avium in human primary
macrophages. By using confocal microscopy, we found that Keap1 associated with
mycobacterial phagosomes in a time-dependent manner, whereas siRNA-mediated
knockdown of Keap1 increased M. avium-induced expression of inflammatory
cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). We show evidence of a mechanism whereby 
Keap1, as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with Cul3 and Rbx1, facilitates 
ubiquitination and degradation of I<U+03BA>B kinase (IKK)-ß thus terminating IKK
activity. Keap1 knockdown led to increased nuclear translocation of transcription
factors NF-<U+03BA>B, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 1, and IRF5 driving the expression of 
inflammatory cytokines and IFN-ß. Furthermore, knockdown of other members of the 
Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex also led to increased cytokine expression, further 
implicating this ligase complex in the regulation of the IKK family. Finally,
increased inflammatory responses in Keap1-silenced cells contributed to decreased
intracellular growth of M. avium in primary human macrophages that was
reconstituted with inhibitors of IKKß or TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Taken
together, we propose that Keap1 acts as a negative regulator for the control of
inflammatory signaling in M. avium-infected human primary macrophages. Although
this might be important to avoid sustained or overwhelming inflammation, our data
suggest that a negative consequence could be facilitated growth of pathogens like
M. avium inside macrophages.

Noradrenaline (NA) has marked anti-inflammatory effects on activated microglial
cells. The present study was conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
NA effects using rat primary cultured microglial cells. NA, an a1 agonist,
phenylephrine (Phe) and a ß2 agonist, terbutaline (Ter) suppressed
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) release by microglia and
prevented neuronal degeneration in LPS-treated neuron-microglia coculture. The
agents suppressed expression of mRNA encoding proinflammatory mediators. Both an 
a1-selective blocker terazocine and a ß2-selective blocker butoxamine overcame
the suppressive effects of NA. cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) inhibitors did not
abolish the suppressive NA effects. LPS decreased I<U+03BA>B leading to NF<U+03BA>B
translocation into nuclei, then induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and expression of interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF1). NA inhibited LPS-induced these changes. When NF<U+03BA>B expression was
knocked down with siRNA, LPS-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression
was abolished. NA did not suppress IL-6 induced STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1
expression. These results suggest that one of the critical mechanisms underlying 
the anti-inflammatory effects of NA is the inhibition of NF<U+03BA>B translocation.
Although inhibitory effects of NA on STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression
may contribute to the overall suppressive effects of NA, these may be the
downstream events of inhibitory effects on NF<U+03BA>B. Since NA, Phe and Ter exerted
almost the same effects and PKA inhibitors did not show significant antagonistic 
effects, the suppression by NA might not be dependent on specific adrenergic
receptors and cAMP-dependent signaling pathway.

The interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF2 of the IRF1 subfamily play
essential roles in immune responses against viruses. IRF11 is a novel IRF gene of
the IRF1 subfamily; IRF11 genes share almost the same evolutionary distance with 
IRF1 and IRF2 genes. However, the structure and characteristics of IRF11 gene in 
fish have been rarely reported. In our study, IRF1, IRF2 and IRF11 genes were
identified and characterized from miiuy croaker genome. Results showed that the
IRF1, IRF2 and IRF11 genes contain the same domains; each of these genes is
composed of conserved gene organizations and characterized by gene synteny with
the orthologous genes. Interestingly, IRF11 was likely found only in fish (but
not specific to teleost fish). Evolutionary analysis results showed that IRF1
gene in mammals, IRF2 and IRF11 gene in fish underwent positive selection. IRF1, 
IRF2 and IRF11 were expressed in a wide range of miiuy croaker tissues. These
genes also exhibited the same expression patterns after miiuy croaker was
infected with poly(I:C). Therefore, our data enhanced our understanding of the
functions and evolution of IRF11 in fish.

BACKGROUND: Resident macrophages in the CNS microglia become activated and
produce proinflammatory molecules upon encountering bacteria or viruses. TLRs are
a phylogenetically conserved diverse family of sensors that drive innate immune
responses following interactions with PAMPs. TLR3 and TLR4 recognize viral dsRNA 
Poly (I:C) and bacterial endotoxin LPS, respectively. Importantly, these
receptors differ in their downstream adaptor molecules. Thus far, only a few
studies have investigated the effects of TLR3 and TLR4 in macrophages. However, a
genome-wide search for the effects of these TLRs has not been performed in
microglia using RNA-seq. Gene expression patterns were determined for the BV-2
microglial cell line when stimulated with viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) or bacterial
endotoxin LPS to identify novel transcribed genes, as well as investigate how
differences in downstream signaling could influence gene expression in innate
immunity.
RESULTS: Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation revealed that common and
unique patterns of proinflammatory genes were significantly up-regulated in
response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. However, the IFN/viral response gene
showed a stronger response to TLR3 stimulation than to TLR4 stimulation.
Unexpectedly, TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation did not activate IFN-ß and IRF3 in BV-2
microglia. Most importantly, we observed that previously unidentified
transcription factors (TFs) (i.e., IRF1, IRF7, and IRF9) and the epigenetic
regulators KDM4A and DNMT3L were significantly up-regulated in both TLR3- and
TLR4-stimulated microglia. We also identified 29 previously unidentified genes
that are important in immune regulation. In addition, we confirmed the
expressions of key inflammatory genes as well as pro-inflammatory mediators in
the supernatants were significantly induced in TLR3-and TLR4-stimulated primary
microglial cells. Moreover, transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and isoforms, as
well as differential promoter usage, revealed a complex pattern of
transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation upon infection with TLR3
and TLR4. Furthermore, TF motif analysis (-950 to +50 bp of the 5' upstream
promoters) revealed that the DNA sequences for NF-<U+03BA>B, IRF1, and STAT1 were
significantly enriched in TLR3- and TLR4-stimulated microglia.
CONCLUSIONS: These unprecedented findings not only permit a comparison of
TLR3-and TLR4-stimulated genes but also identify new genes that have not been
previously implicated in innate immunity.

during Postnatal Intestinal Maturation.

The neonatal intestine is a very complex and dynamic organ that must rapidly
adapt and remodel in response to a barrage of environmental stimuli during the
first few postnatal weeks. Recent studies demonstrate that the zinc finger
transcriptional repressor Blimp1/Prdm1 plays an essential role governing
postnatal reprogramming of intestinal enterocytes during this period. Functional 
loss results in global changes in gene expression patterns, particularly in genes
associated with metabolic function. Here we engineered a knock-in allele
expressing an eGFP-tagged fusion protein under control of the endogenous
regulatory elements and performed genome wide ChIP-seq analysis to identify
direct Blimp1 targets and further elucidate the function of Blimp1 in intestinal 
development. Comparison with published human and mouse datasets revealed a highly
conserved core set of genes including interferon-inducible promoters. Here we
show that the interferon-inducible transcriptional activator Irf1 is
constitutively expressed throughout fetal and postnatal intestinal epithelium
development. ChIP-seq demonstrates closely overlapping Blimp1 and Irf1 peaks at
key components of the MHC class I pathway in fetal enterocytes. The onset of MHC 
class I expression coincides with down-regulated Blimp1 expression during the
suckling to weaning transition. Collectively, these experiments strongly suggest 
that in addition to regulating the enterocyte metabolic switch, Blimp1 functions 
as a gatekeeper in opposition to Irf1 to prevent premature activation of the MHC 
class I pathway in villus epithelium to maintain tolerance in the neonatal
intestine.

Classically or alternatively activated macrophages (M1 and M2, respectively) play
distinct and important roles for microbiocidal activity, regulation of
inflammation and tissue homeostasis. Despite this, their transcriptional
regulatory dynamics are poorly understood. Using promoter-level expression
profiling by non-biased deepCAGE we have studied the transcriptional dynamics of 
classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Transcription factor (TF)
binding motif activity analysis revealed four motifs, NFKB1_REL_RELA, IRF1,2,
IRF7 and TBP that are commonly activated but have distinct activity dynamics in
M1 and M2 activation. We observe matching changes in the expression profiles of
the corresponding TFs and show that only a restricted set of TFs change
expression. There is an overall drastic and transient up-regulation in M1 and a
weaker and more sustainable up-regulation in M2. Novel TFs, such as Thap6, Maff, 
(M1) and Hivep1, Nfil3, Prdm1, (M2) among others, were suggested to be involved
in the activation processes. Additionally, 52 (M1) and 67 (M2) novel
differentially expressed genes and, for the first time, several differentially
expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptome markers were identified. In 
conclusion, the finding of novel motifs, TFs and protein-coding and lncRNA genes 
is an important step forward to fully understand the transcriptional machinery of
macrophage activation.

Delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) is a noncanonical ligand that inhibits NOTCH1
receptor activity and regulates multiple differentiation processes. In
macrophages, NOTCH signaling increases TLR-induced expression of key
pro-inflammatory mediators. We have investigated the role of DLK1 in macrophage
activation and inflammation using Dlk1-deficient mice and Raw 264.7 cells
overexpressing Dlk1. In the absence of Dlk1, NOTCH1 expression is increased and
the activation of macrophages with TLR3 or TLR4 agonists leads to higher
production of IFN-ß and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-12,
and IL-23. The expression of key proteins involved in IFN-ß signaling, such as
IRF3, IRF7, IRF1, or STAT1, as well as cRel, or RelB, which are responsible for
the generation of IL-12 and IL-23, is enhanced in Dlk1 KO macrophages.
Consistently, Dlk1 KO mice are more sensitive to LPS-induced endotoxic shock.
These effects seem to be mediated through the modulation of NOTCH1 signaling.
TLR4 activation reduces DLK1 expression, whereas increases NOTCH1 levels. In
addition, DLK1 expression diminishes during differentiation of human U937 cells
to macrophages. Overall, these results reveal a novel role for DLK1 as a
regulator of NOTCH-mediated, pro-inflammatory macrophage activation, which could 
help to ensure a baseline level preventing constant tissue inflammation.

Multiple pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced TLR pathway cross-talk
provokes proinflammatory cytokine synergy in macrophages, which is important for 
pathogen resistance and immune homeostasis. However, the detailed mechanisms are 
unclear. In this article, we demonstrate viral RNA analog-induced transcription
synergy of Il6 and Il12b via IFN regulatory factor (IRF)1 (TLR3-TIR
domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-ß [TRIF] responsive), C/EBPß (TLR7-MyD88
responsive), and JunB (all responsive). Coactivation of the TLR3 and TLR7
pathways synchronizes the interaction of IRF1, JunB, and C/EBPß with the Il6 and 
Il12b promoters, facilitating maximal gene expression. MyD88 pathway activation
suppresses TRIF-induced IRF1 in a delayed manner, controlling the magnitude and
timing of cytokine expression. Our findings provide novel mechanisms of
cooperation of different TLR pathways to achieve optimal immune responses, with
the potential for immunomodulatory strategies.

Experimental models of colitis in mice have been used extensively for analyzing
the molecular events that occur during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
development. However, it is uncertain to what extent the experimental models
reproduce features of human IBD. This is largely due to the lack of precise
methods for direct and comprehensive comparison of mouse and human inflamed colon
tissue at the molecular level. Here, we use global gene expression patterns of
two sets of pediatric IBD and two mouse models of colitis to obtain a direct
comparison of the genome signatures of mouse and human IBD. By comparing the two 
sets of pediatric IBD microarray data, we found 83 genes were differentially
expressed in a similar manner between pediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis. Up-regulation of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) gene that
maps to 17q12, a confirmed IBD susceptibility loci, indicates that our comparison
study can reveal known genetic associations with IBD. In comparing pediatric IBD 
and experimental colitis microarray data, we found common signatures amongst them
including: (1) up-regulation of CXCL9 and S100A8; (2) cytokine-cytokine receptor 
pathway dysregulation; and (3) over-represented IRF1 and IRF2 transcription
binding sites in the promoter region of up-regulated genes, and HNF1A and Lhx3
binding sites were over-represented in the promoter region of the down-regulated 
genes. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive view of transcriptome
changes between different pediatric IBD populations in comparison with different 
colitis models. These findings reveal several new molecular targets for further
study in the regulation of colitis.

MS is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration in the CNS,
leading to cumulative disability. IFN-ß, used clinically in RR-MS reduces lesion 
formation and rates of relapse. Although the molecular mechanisms are not
entirely elucidated, myeloid cells appear to be a major target for the
therapeutic effects of IFN-ß. DCs have a critical role in experimental models of 
MS through their effect on encephalitogenic Th1/Th17 cell differentiation and
expansion. Here we focused on the effects of IFN-ß on DC expression of cytokines 
involved in the control of Th1/Th17 differentiation and expansion. Administration
of IFN-ß to mice immunized with MOG35-55 inhibited IL-12 and IL-23 expression in 
splenic DC and reduced in vivo differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells. IFN-ß affected 
cytokine expression in TLR-stimulated DC in a similar manner in vitro, inhibiting
IL-12 and IL-23 and stimulating IL-10 at both mRNA and protein levels, by
signaling through IFNAR. We investigated the role of the signaling molecules
STAT1/STAT2, IRF-1 and IRF-7, and of the PI3K<U+2192>GSK3 pathway. IFN-ß inhibition of
the IL-12 subunits p40 and p35 was mediated through STAT1/STAT2, whereas
inhibition of IL-23 was STAT1 dependent, and the stimulatory effect on IL-10
expression was mediated through STAT2. IFN-ß induces IRF-7 and, to a lesser
degree, IRF-1. However, neither IRF mediated the effects of IFN-ß on IL-12,
IL-23, or IL-10. We found that the PI3K pathway mediated IL-12 inhibition but did
not interfere with the inhibition of IL-23 or stimulation of IL-10.

BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNAs that do not code
protein but play important roles in diverse biological processes. In recent
years, with the application of high-throughput sequencing, a great deal of
lncRNAs associated with virus infections have been discovered and intensively
studied, but there are few studies about the relationship between lncRNAs and HCV
replication.
METHODS: We identify that several lncRNAs can be upregulated and downregulated by
phosphorylated STAT3 by using human PCR array method. And among these lncRNAs,
lnc-Lethe was involved in the HCV replication. Transfection of siRNA Lethe
partially blocked the replication of HCV in Huh7 cells.
RESULTS: In the present study, we have established that phosphorylated STAT3 can 
promote the HCV replication. Data also indicated that when transfected with siRNA
Lethe, the expression levels of PKR, OAS and IRF1, which were all ISGs, were all 
up regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings from Lethe knockdown, we have identified that 
Lethe, which was upregulated by activated STAT3, may promoting the replication of
HCV through a negative regulatory mechanism of type I IFN response.

Differential Expression Profile of Chicken Embryo Fibroblast DF-1 Cells Infected 
with Cell-Adapted Infectious Bursal Disease Virus.

RNA-Seq was used to unveil the transcriptional profile of DF-1 cells at the early
stage of caIBDV infection. Total RNAs were extracted from virus-infected cells at
0, 6 and 12 hpi. RNA-Seq datasets of respective samples mapped to 56.5-57.6% of
isoforms in the reference genome Galgal4.73. At 6 hpi, 23 isoforms underwent an
elevated expression, while 128 isoforms were up-regulated and 5 were
down-regulated at 12 hpi in the virus-infected group. Besides, 10 isoforms were
exclusively expressed in the virus-infected cells. Though no significant change
was detected in cytokine and interferon expression levels at the first 12 hours
of infection, modulations of the upstream regulators were observed. In addition
to the reported regulatory factors including EIF2AK2, MX, OAS*A, GBP7 and IFIT,
IBDV infection also triggered a IFIT5-IRF1/3-RSAD5 pathway in the DF-1 cells
which potentially restricted the viral replication cycle in the early infection
stage. Over-expression of LIPA and CH25H, together with the suppression of
STARD4, LSS and AACS genes implied a modulation of membrane fluidity and lipid
raft arrangement in the infected cells. Alternative splicing of the EFR3 homolog 
A gene was also through to be involved in the lipid membrane regulation, and
these cumulative responses projected an inhibition of viral endocytosis.
Recognition of viral RNA genomes and intermediates was presumably enhanced by the
elevated levels of IFIH1, DHX58 and TRIM25 genes which possess properties on
detecting viral dsRNA. On the other hand, the caIBDV arrested the host's
apoptotic process by inducing the expression of apoptosis inhibitors including
NFKBIA/Z, TNFAIP2/3 and ITA at the first 12 hours of infection. In conclusion,
the differential expression landscape demonstrated with RNA-Seq provides a
comprehensive picture on the molecular interactions between host cells and virus 
at the early stage of infection.

Previous studies revealed that thymus is a targeted immune organ in malnutrition,
and high-boron stress is harmful for immune organs. African ostrich is the living
fossil of ancient birds and the food animals in modern life. There is no report
about the effect of boron intake on thymus of ostrich. The purpose of present
study was to evaluate the effect of excessive boron stress on ostrich thymus and 
the potential role of TLR3/4 signals in this process. Histological analysis
demonstrated that long-term boron stress (640 mg/L for 90 days) did not disrupt
ostrich thymic structure during postnatal development. However, the numbers of
apoptotic cells showed an increased tendency, and the expression of autophagy and
proliferation markers increased significantly in ostrich thymus after boron
treatment. Next, we examined the expression of TLR3 and TLR4 with their
downstream molecular in thymus under boron stress. Since ostrich genome was not
available when we started the research, we first cloned ostrich TLR3 TLR4 cDNA
from thymus. Ostrich TLR4 was close to white-throated Tinamou. Whole avian TLR4
codons were under purify selection during evolution, whereas 80 codons were under
positive selection. TLR3 and TLR4 were expressed in ostrich thymus and bursa of
fabricius as was revealed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). TLR4
expression increased with age but significantly decreased after boron treatment, 
whereas TLR3 expression showed the similar tendency. Their downstream molecular
factors (IRF1, JNK, ERK, p38, IL-6 and IFN) did not change significantly in
thymus, except that p100 was significantly increased under boron stress when
analyzed by qRT-PCR or western blot. Taken together, these results suggest that
ostrich thymus developed resistance against long-term excessive boron stress,
possibly by accelerating intrathymic cell death and proliferation, which may
bypass the TLR3/4 pathway. In addition, attenuated TLRs activity may explain the 
reduced inflammatory response to pathogens under boron stress.

Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause several different leukemia-like
proliferative diseases in the hemopoietic system of chickens. Here, we
investigated the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of
ALV-J-infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify the genes and miRNAs
related to ALV-J invasion. In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially
expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens.
miR-23b expression was up-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared with the
control spleens, and transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was down-regulated in ALV-J-infected
spleens compared to uninfected spleens. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed
that IRF1 was a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression significantly (P
= 0.0022) decreased IRF1 mRNA levels and repressed IRF1-3'-UTR reporter activity.
In vitro experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression strengthened ALV-J
replication, whereas miR-23b loss of function inhibited ALV-J replication. IRF1
overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication, and IRF1 knockdown enhanced ALV-J
replication. Moreover, IRF1 overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased
IFN-ß expression. In conclusion, these results suggested that miR-23b may play an
important role in ALV-J replication by targeting IRF1.

Bats are important reservoirs for several viruses, many of which cause lethal
infections in humans but have reduced pathogenicity in bats. As the innate immune
response is critical for controlling viruses, the nature of this response in bats
and how it may differ from that in other mammals are of great interest. Using
next-generation transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq), we profiled the
transcriptional response of Pteropus vampyrus bat kidney (PVK) cells to Newcastle
disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus known to elicit a strong innate
immune response in mammalian cells. The Pteropus genus is a known reservoir of
Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Analysis of the 200 to 300 regulated
genes showed that genes for interferon (IFN) and antiviral pathways are highly
upregulated in NDV-infected PVK cells, including genes for beta IFN, RIG-I, MDA5,
ISG15, and IRF1. NDV-infected cells also upregulated several genes not previously
characterized to be antiviral, such as RND1, SERTAD1, CHAC1, and MORC3. In fact, 
we show that MORC3 is induced by both IFN and NDV infection in PVK cells but is
not induced by either stimulus in human A549 cells. In contrast to NDV infection,
HeV and NiV infection of PVK cells failed to induce these innate immune response 
genes. Likewise, an attenuated response was observed in PVK cells infected with
recombinant NDVs expressing the NiV IFN antagonist proteins V and W. This study
provides the first global profile of a robust virus-induced innate immune
response in bats and indicates that henipavirus IFN antagonist mechanisms are
likely active in bat cells.IMPORTANCE: Bats are the reservoir host for many
highly pathogenic human viruses, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses, and many other viruses
have also been isolated from bats. Viral infections are reportedly asymptomatic
or heavily attenuated in bat populations. Despite their ecological importance to 
viral maintenance, research into their immune system and mechanisms for viral
control has only recently begun. Nipah virus and Hendra virus are two
paramyxoviruses associated with high mortality rates in humans and whose
reservoir is the Pteropus genus of bats. Greater knowledge of the innate immune
response of P. vampyrus bats to viral infection may elucidate how bats serve as a
reservoir for so many viruses.

Resistance to radiation therapy constitutes a significant challenge in the
treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Alteration in DNA
methylation is thought to play a role in this resistance. Here, we analyzed DNA
methylation changes in a matched model of radiation resistance for HNSCC using
the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our results show that compared to
radiation-sensitive cells (SCC-61), radiation-resistant cells (rSCC-61) had a
significant increase in DNA methylation. After combining these results with
microarray gene expression data, we identified 84 differentially methylated and
expressed genes between these 2 cell lines. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed
ILK signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, fatty acid a-oxidation, and
cell cycle regulation as top canonical pathways associated with radiation
resistance. Validation studies focused on CCND2, a protein involved in cell cycle
regulation, which was identified as hypermethylated in the promoter region and
downregulated in rSCC-61 relative to SCC-61 cells. Treatment of rSCC-61 and
SCC-61 with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'deoxycitidine increased CCND2
levels only in rSCC-61 cells, while treatment with the control reagent cytosine
arabinoside did not influence the expression of this gene. Further analysis of
HNSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas found increased methylation in
radiation-resistant tumors, consistent with the cell culture data. Our findings
point to global DNA methylation status as a biomarker of radiation resistance in 
HNSCC, and suggest a need for targeted manipulation of DNA methylation to
increase radiation response in HNSCC.

BACKGROUND: Cellular antiviral activities are critically controlled by
transcriptional activation of interferon-inducible genes, involving interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs). Previous data suggested that IRF1 is an activator and 
IRF2 is a repressor, which functionally antagonize each other in transcriptional 
regulation. However, it is not clear how these two factors function to regulate
cellular antiviral activities.
RESULTS: We show that IRF2 is critically required for the induction of the TLR3
and other interferon-inducible genes in a chromatin environment. While both IRF1 
and IRF2 directly interact with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, IRF2 is
associated with the TLR3 promoter in the unstimulated state and IRF1 binding to
the promoter is strongly induced by stimulation with interferon, suggesting that 
these two factors may function at different stages of gene induction in the
recruitment of the BAF complex. IRF2 acts to maintain the basal level expression,
an open chromatin structure, and active histone modification marks (H3K9, K14
acetylation and H3K4 tri-methylation) of the TLR3 promoter in the unstimulated
state, while IRF1 serves to rapidly activate the promoter upon stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF1 and IRF2 of the IRF family of transcription factors play
distinct roles in cellular response to viral infection. IRF2 binds to TLR3 and
other IFN-inducible gene promoters and maintains an active chromatin structure in
the unstimulated state, which is required for their induction, while IRF1 binding
to these promoters activates their transcription upon viral infection. Thus, the 
division of labor between the IRF transcription factor family members plays a
pivotal role in coordinating the transcriptional activation in the cellular
antiviral response.

Basic leucine zipper transcription factor Batf2 is poorly described, whereas Batf
and Batf3 have been shown to play essential roles in dendritic cell, T cell, and 
B cell development and regulation. Batf2 was drastically induced in
IFN-<U+03B3>-activated classical macrophages (M1) compared with unstimulated or
IL-4-activated alternative macrophages (M2). Batf2 knockdown experiments from
IFN-<U+03B3>-activated macrophages and subsequent expression profiling demonstrated
important roles for regulation of immune responses, inducing inflammatory and
host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, and Nos2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Beijing
strain HN878)-infected macrophages further induced Batf2 and augmented
host-protective Batf2-dependent genes, particularly in M1, whose mechanism was
suggested to be mediated through both TLR2 and TLR4 by LPS and heat-killed HN878 
(HKTB) stimulation experiments. Irf1 binding motif was enriched in the promoters 
of Batf2-regulated genes. Coimmunoprecipitation study demonstrated Batf2
association with Irf1. Furthermore, Irf1 knockdown showed downregulation of
IFN-<U+03B3>- or LPS/HKTB-activated host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, Il12b, and Nos2.
Conclusively, Batf2 is an activation marker gene for M1 involved in gene
regulation of IFN-<U+03B3>-activated classical macrophages, as well as LPS/HKTB-induced 
macrophage stimulation, possibly by Batf2/Irf1 gene induction. Taken together,
these results underline the role of Batf2/Irf1 in inducing inflammatory responses
in M. tuberculosis infection.

Late stage cancer is often associated with reduced immune recognition and a
highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The presence of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and specific gene-signatures prior to treatment
are linked to good prognosis, while the opposite is true for extensive
immunosuppression. The use of adenoviruses as cancer vaccines is a form of active
immunotherapy to initialise a tumor-specific immune response that targets the
patient's unique tumor antigen repertoire. We report a case of a 68-year-old male
with asbestos-related malignant pleural mesothelioma who was treated in a Phase I
study with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing
oncolytic adenovirus, Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF (ONCOS-102). The treatment resulted in
prominent infiltration of CD8(+) lymphocytes to tumor, marked induction of
systemic antitumor CD8(+) T-cells and induction of Th1-type polarization in the
tumor. These results indicate that ONCOS-102 treatment sensitizes tumors to other
immunotherapies by inducing a T-cell positive phenotype to an initially T-cell
negative tumor.

Inhibition of Janus-activated kinase-1 (JAK1) is a promising clinical concept for
post-transplant immunosuppression and autoimmunity. However, it also raises
concerns regarding possible immunosuppressive side effects. Our study
investigates JAK1 signalling in the context of CD40L and bacterially activated
human MoDC using siRNA and biological inhibitors. We demonstrate that strong
stimuli (e.g. intact Escherichia coli or LPS in addition to IL-1ß) induce
IL-12p70 via a ROS/RELA/CDK9 pathway that is inhibited by simultaneous JAK1/STAT3
signalling. Transcription is effective if RELA recruits the positive
transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) component CDK9 to a combined
RELA/STAT3 binding site -50 to -20bp upstream of the start site of the IL-12p35
promoter. STAT3 simultaneously attaches to this site and inhibits CDK9 binding.
In the presence of IFN<U+03B3>, JAK1/2 inhibitors block STAT1/IRF1/IRF8-dependent
activation and simultaneously enhance CDK9-dependent activation signals. This
inverse regulation of IFN<U+03B3>- vs. E. coli-induced cytokine production by JAK
inhibitors including Ruxolitinib was similarly observed for IL-6 and TNF-a
production, but not for IL-10 production. Thus, JAK1 inhibition enhances IL-12p70
production in this context by increased DNA binding of CDK9. In contrast, weak
RELA-activation signals (CD40L, LPS) depended on IFN-<U+03B3> induced STAT1/IRF1/IRF8
co-signalling, which was completely blocked by JAK inhibitors as reported before.
Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism of how cytokine responses to
invading pathogens are separable from IFN<U+03B3>-dependent autoimmunity by targeting
JAK1/STAT3 activation.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection causes severe mortality involving multiple
possible mechanisms, including cytokine storm, brain stem encephalitis, and
fulminant pulmonary edema. Gamma interferon (IFN-<U+03B3>) may confer anti-EV71
activity; however, the claim that disease severity is highly correlated to an
increase in IFN-<U+03B3> is controversial and would indicate an immune escape initiated 
by EV71. This study, investigating the role of IFN-<U+03B3> in EV71 infection using a
murine model, showed that IFN-<U+03B3> was elevated. Moreover, IFN-<U+03B3> receptor-deficient 
mice showed higher mortality rates and more severe disease progression with
slower viral clearance than wild-type mice. In vitro results showed that IFN-<U+03B3>
pretreatment reduced EV71 yield, whereas EV71 infection caused IFN-<U+03B3> resistance
with attenuated IFN-<U+03B3> signaling in IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) gene
transactivation. To study the immunoediting ability of EV71 proteins in IFN-<U+03B3>
signaling, 11 viral proteins were stably expressed in cells without cytotoxicity;
however, viral proteins 2A and 3D blocked IFN-<U+03B3>-induced IRF1 transactivation
following a loss of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
nuclear translocation. Viral 3D attenuated IFN-<U+03B3> signaling accompanied by a STAT1
decrease without interfering with IFN-<U+03B3> receptor expression. Restoration of STAT1
or blocking 3D activity was able to rescue IFN-<U+03B3> signaling. Interestingly, viral 
2A attenuated IFN-<U+03B3> signaling using another mechanism by reducing the serine
phosphorylation of STAT1 following the inactivation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase without affecting STAT1 expression. These results
demonstrate the anti-EV71 ability of IFN-<U+03B3> and the immunoediting ability by EV71 
2A and 3D, which attenuate IFN-<U+03B3> signaling through different
mechanisms.IMPORTANCE: Immunosurveillance by gamma interferon (IFN-<U+03B3>) may confer 
anti-enterovirus 71 (anti-EV71) activity; however, the claim that disease
severity is highly correlated to an increase in IFN-<U+03B3> is controversial and would 
indicate an immune escape initiated by EV71. IFN-<U+03B3> receptor-deficient mice showed
higher mortality and more severe disease progression, indicating the anti-EV71
property of IFN-<U+03B3>. However, EV71 infection caused cellular insusceptibility in
response to IFN-<U+03B3> stimulation. We used an in vitro system with viral protein
expression to explore the novel IFN-<U+03B3> inhibitory properties of the EV71 2A and 3D
proteins through the different mechanisms. According to this study, targeting
either 2A or 3D pharmacologically and/or genetically may sustain a cellular
susceptibility in response to IFN-<U+03B3>, particularly for IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated anti-EV71
activity.

Preclinical models of human conditions including asthma showed the therapeutic
potential of Compound A (CpdA), a dissociated glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GRa) 
ligand. Whether CpdA inhibits GC resistance, a central feature of severe asthma, 
has not been addressed. We investigated whether CpdA modulates cytokine-induced
GC resistance in human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Healthy and asthmatic
ASM cells were treated with TNF-a/IFN-<U+03B3> for 24 hours in the presence or absence
of CpdA. ELISA and quantitative PCR assays were used to assess the effect of CpdA
on chemokine expression. Activation of GRa by CpdA was assessed by quantitative
PCR, immunostaining, and receptor antagonism using RU486. An effect of CpdA on
the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) was investigated 
using immunoblot, immunostaining, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown.
CpdA inhibited production of fluticasone-resistant chemokines CCL5, CX3CL1, and
CXCL10 at protein and mRNA levels in both asthmatic and healthy cells. CpdA
failed to induce expression of GC-induced Leucine Zipper while transiently
inducing mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) at both mRNA and 
protein levels. CpdA inhibitory action was not associated with GRa nuclear
translocation, nor was it prevented by RU486 antagonism. Activation of IRF-1 by
TNF-a/IFN-<U+03B3> was inhibited by CpdA. IRF-1 siRNA knockdown reduced cytokine-induced
CCL5 and CX3CL1 production. siRNA MKP-1 prevented the inhibitory effect of CpdA
on cytokine-induced CXCL10 production. For the first time, we show that CpdA
inhibits the production of GC-resistant chemokines via GRa-independent mechanisms
involving the inhibition of IRF-1 and up-regulation of MKP-1. Thus, targeting
CpdA-sensitive pathways in ASM cells represents an alternative therapeutic
approach to treat GC resistance in asthma.

Psoriasis drug development and GWAS interpretation through in silico analysis of 
transcription factor binding sites.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a cytokine-mediated skin disease that can be treated
effectively with immunosuppressive biologic agents. These medications, however,
are not equally effective in all patients and are poorly suited for treating mild
psoriasis. To develop more targeted therapies, interfering with transcription
factor (TF) activity is a promising strategy.
METHODS: Meta-analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
in the lesional skin from psoriasis patients (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>237). We compiled a dictionary 
of 2935 binding sites representing empirically-determined binding affinities of
TFs and unconventional DNA-binding proteins (uDBPs). This dictionary was screened
to identify "psoriasis response elements" (PREs) overrepresented in sequences
upstream of psoriasis DEGs.
RESULTS: PREs are recognized by IRF1, ISGF3, NF-kappaB and multiple TFs with
helix-turn-helix (homeo) or other all-alpha-helical (high-mobility group)
DNA-binding domains. We identified a limited set of DEGs that encode proteins
interacting with PRE motifs, including TFs (GATA3, EHF, FOXM1, SOX5) and uDBPs
(AVEN, RBM8A, GPAM, WISP2). PREs were prominent within enhancer regions near
cytokine-encoding DEGs (IL17A, IL19 and IL1B), suggesting that PREs might be
incorporated into complex decoy oligonucleotides (cdODNs). To illustrate this
idea, we designed a cdODN to concomitantly target psoriasis-activated TFs (i.e., 
FOXM1, ISGF3, IRF1 and NF-kappaB). Finally, we screened psoriasis-associated SNPs
to identify risk alleles that disrupt or engender PRE motifs. This identified
possible sites of allele-specific TF/uDBP binding and showed that PREs are
disproportionately disrupted by psoriasis risk alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified new TF/uDBP candidates and developed an approach that 
(i) connects transcriptome informatics to cdODN drug development and (ii)
enhances our ability to interpret GWAS findings. Disruption of PRE motifs by
psoriasis risk alleles may contribute to disease susceptibility.

Microglial cells become rapidly activated through interactions with pathogens,
and the persistent activation of these cells is associated with various
neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have investigated the transcriptomic
signatures in microglia or macrophages using microarray technologies. However,
this method has numerous restrictions, such as spatial biases, uneven probe
properties, low sensitivity, and dependency on the probes spotted. To overcome
this limitation and identify novel transcribed genes in response to LPS, we used 
RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to determine the novel transcriptomic signatures in BV-2
microglial cells. Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation showed that
approximately 263 and 319 genes (= 1.5 log2-fold), such as cytokines and
chemokines, were strongly induced after 2 and 4 h, respectively, and the
induction of several genes with unknown immunological functions was also
observed. Importantly, we observed that previously unidentified transcription
factors (TFs) (irf1, irf7, and irf9), histone demethylases (kdm4a) and DNA
methyltransferases (dnmt3l) were significantly and selectively expressed in BV-2 
microglial cells. The gene expression levels, transcription start sites (TSS),
isoforms, and differential promoter usage revealed a complex pattern of
transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation upon infection with LPS.
In addition, gene ontology, molecular networks and pathway analyses identified
the top significantly regulated functional classification, canonical pathways and
network functions at each activation status. Moreover, we further analyzed
differentially expressed genes to identify transcription factor (TF) motifs (-950
to +50 bp of the 5' upstream promoters) and epigenetic mechanisms. Furthermore,
we confirmed that the expressions of key inflammatory genes as well as
pro-inflammatory mediators in the supernatants were significantly induced in LPS 
treated primary microglial cells. This transcriptomic analysis is the first to
show a comparison of the family-wide differential expression of most known immune
genes and also reveal transcription evidence of multiple gene families in BV-2
microglial cells. Collectively, these findings reveal unique transcriptomic
signatures in BV-2 microglial cells required for homeostasis and effective immune
responses.

In patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, enhanced activity of
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO) has been reported. IDO - a
tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme - has been considered as both an innate defence
mechanism and an important regulator of the immune response. The molecular
mechanism of IDO induction in HCV infection and its role in the antiviral immune 
response remain unknown. Using primary human hepatocytes, we show that HCV
infection stimulates IDO expression. IDO gene induction was transient and
coincided with the expression of types I and III interferons (IFNs) and
IFN-stimulated genes in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Overexpression of hepatic IDO
prior to HCV infection markedly impaired HCV replication in hepatocytes,
suggesting that IDO limits the spread of HCV within the liver. siRNA-mediated IDO
knock-down revealed that IDO functions as an IFN-mediated anti-HCV effector.
Hepatic IDO was most potently induced by IFN-x03B3;, and ongoing HCV replication 
could significantly upregulate IDO expression. IRF1 (IFN-regulatory factor 1) and
STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) regulated hepatic IDO 
expression. Hepatic IDO expression also had a significant inhibitory effect on
CD4+ T-cell proliferation. Our data suggest that hepatic IDO plays a dual role
during HCV infection by slowing down viral replication and also regulating host
immune responses.

Inflammasomes are critical for mounting host defense against pathogens. The
molecular mechanisms that control activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in response
to different cytosolic pathogens remain unclear. Here we found that the
transcription factor IRF1 was required for activation of the AIM2 inflammasome
during infection with the Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida (F.
novicida), whereas engagement of the AIM2 inflammasome by mouse cytomegalovirus
(MCMV) or transfected double-stranded DNA did not require IRF1. Infection of F.
novicida detected by the DNA sensor cGAS and its adaptor STING induced type I
interferon-dependent expression of IRF1, which drove the expression of
guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs); this led to intracellular killing of bacteria 
and DNA release. Our results reveal a specific requirement for IRF1 and GBPs in
the liberation of DNA for sensing by AIM2 depending on the pathogen encountered
by the cell.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) act as transcription mediators in virus-,
bacteria-, and interferon (IFN)-induced signaling pathways and play diverse
functions in antimicrobial defense, immune modulation, hematopoietic
differentiation, and cell apoptosis. In this study, we described for the first
time eleven IRFs (IRF1, IRF1L, IRF2X1, IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, IRF5, IRF6, IRF7,
IRF8, and IRF9) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and
examined their tissue distributions and expression patterns under different
conditions. The deduced protein sequences of these IRFs (except IRF1) share high 
identities (71.8-86.6%) with other corresponding IRFs in other teleosts, whereas 
the sequence identity of IRF1 with the corresponding IRF1 in other teleosts is
only 58.1%. A conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD), which is
characterized by a winged type helix-loop-helix motif with four to six tryptophan
repeats, is present in all IRFs. Another conserved IRF associated domain (IAD),
which mediates the interactions in the C-terminal part of the protein, is present
in all IRFs except IRF1 and IRF2X1, which instead contain the IAD2 domain.
Several special domains also were found, including a serine-rich domain (SRD) in 
IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, and IRF7; a proline-rich domain (PRD) in IRF9; nuclear
localization signals (NLSs) in IRF5, IRF8, and IRF9; and a virus activated domain
(VAD) in IRF5. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that
expression of all IRFs occurred in multiple tissues. IRF1, IRF2X1, IRF4a, IRF5,
IRF7, and IRF8 exhibited relatively high levels of expression in immune organs,
whereas the other five IRFs displayed high levels of expression in non-immune
organs. Infection with extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and
virus upregulated the expression of IRFs in a manner that depended on tissue
type, pathogen, and infection stage. Specifically, IRF1 and IRF2X1 were highly
induced by bacterial and viral pathogens; IRF1L and IRF6 responded mainly to
extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens; IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, IRF8, and 
IRF9 were markedly induced by intracellular bacterial pathogen and virus; IRF4a
and IRF4b were mainly induced by virus and intracellular bacterial pathogen
respectively. These results indicate that the IRFs of C. semilaevis can be
categorized into several groups which exhibit different expression patterns in
response to the infection of different microbial pathogens. These results provide
new insights into the roles of teleost IRFs in antimicrobial immunity.

Variability in the developing antibody repertoire is focused on the third
complementarity determining region of the H chain (CDR-H3), which lies at the
center of the antigen binding site where it often plays a decisive role in
antigen binding. The power of VDJ recombination and N nucleotide addition has led
to the common conception that the sequence of CDR-H3 is unrestricted in its
variability and random in its composition. Under this view, the immune response
is solely controlled by somatic positive and negative clonal selection mechanisms
that act on individual B cells to promote production of protective antibodies and
prevent the production of self-reactive antibodies. This concept of a repertoire 
of random antigen binding sites is inconsistent with the observation that
diversity (DH) gene segment sequence content by reading frame (RF) is
evolutionarily conserved, creating biases in the prevalence and distribution of
individual amino acids in CDR-H3. For example, arginine, which is often found in 
the CDR-H3 of dsDNA binding autoantibodies, is under-represented in the commonly 
used DH RFs rearranged by deletion, but is a frequent component of rarely used
inverted RF1 (iRF1), which is rearranged by inversion. To determine the effect of
altering this germline bias in DH gene segment sequence on autoantibody
production, we generated mice that by genetic manipulation are forced to utilize 
an iRF1 sequence encoding two arginines. Over a one year period we collected
serial serum samples from these unimmunized, specific pathogen-free mice and
found that more than one-fifth of them contained elevated levels of dsDNA-binding
IgG, but not IgM; whereas mice with a wild type DH sequence did not. Thus,
germline bias against the use of arginine enriched DH sequence helps to reduce
the likelihood of producing self-reactive antibodies.

The levels of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver are
associated with response to treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus
ribavirin (RBV). However, associations between the responses of ISGs to IFN-based
therapy and treatment efficacy or interleukin-28B (IL28B) genotype have not yet
been determined. Therefore, we investigated the early responses of ISGs and
interferon-lambdas (IFN-<U+03BB>s) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during 
PEG-IFN/RBV plus NS3/4 protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. We prospectively enrolled
50 chronic hepatitis C patients with HCV genotype 1, and collected PBMCs at
baseline, 8 and 24 h after the initial administration of PEG-IFN/RBV/PI. Levels
of mRNAs for selected ISGs and IFN-<U+03BB>s were evaluated by real-time PCR. All 31
patients with a favorable IL28B genotype and 13 of 19 with an unfavorable
genotype achieved sustained virological responses (SVR). Levels of mRNA for A20, 
SOCS1, and SOCS3, known to suppress antiviral activity by interfering with the
IFN signaling pathway, as well as IRF1 were significantly higher at 8 h in
patients with an unfavorable IL28B genotype than in those with a favorable one (P
= 0.007, 0.026, 0.0004, 0.0006, respectively), especially in the non-SVR group.
Particularly, the fold-change of IRF1 at 8 h relative to baseline was
significantly higher in non-SVR than in SVR cases with an unfavorable IL28B
genotype (P = 0.035). In conclusion, levels of several mRNAs of genes suppressing
antiviral activity in PBMCs during PEG-IFN/RBV/PI differed according to IL28B
genotypes, paralleling treatment efficacy.

ADAR1, involved in A-to-I RNA editing, belongs to adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA (ADAR) family. A-to-I RNA editing is the most widespread editing phenomenon
in higher eukaryotes. In the present study, we cloned and identified the
full-length cDNA, complete genomic sequence and the promoter sequence of grass
carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) ADAR1 (CiADAR1) by homology cloning strategy and
genome walking. CiADAR1 full-length cDNA is comprised of a 5'UTR (43 <U+2009>bp), a
3'UTR (229 bp) and a 4179 bp ORF encoding a polypeptide of 1392 amino acids. The 
deduced amino acid sequence of CiADAR1 contains two Z-DNA binding domains, three 
dsRNA binding motifs and a conserved catalytic domain. The complete genomic
CiADAR1 has 16 exons and 15 introns. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that
CiADAR1 shared high homology with Danio rerio ADAR1 (DrADAR1). RT-PCR showed that
CiADAR1 were ubiquitously expressed and significantly up-regulated after
stimulation with poly I:C. In spleen and liver, CiADAR1 mRNA reached the peak at 
12 h and maintained the highest level during 12-24 h post-injection. CiADAR1
promoter was found to be 1102<U+2009>bp in length and divided into two distinct regions,
the proximal region containing three putative interferon regulatory factor
binding elements (IRF-E) and the distal region containing only one IRF-E. To
further study the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CiADAR1, grass carp
IRF1 (CiIRF1) and IRF3 (CiIRF3) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and
purified by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA His-Bind resin. Then, gel
mobility shift assay was employed to analyze the affinity of CiADAR1 promoter
sequence with CiIRF1 and CiIRF3 in vitro. The result revealed that CiIRF1 and
CiIRF3 bound to CiADAR1 promoter with high affinity, indicating that IRF1 and
IRF3 could be the potential transcriptional regulatory factor for CiADAR1.
Co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-IRF1 (or pcDNA3.1-IRF3) with pGL3-CiADAR1 into
C.<U+2009>idella kidney (CIK) cells showed that both IRF1 and IRF3 played a positive
role in CiADAR1 transcription. In addition, the mutant assay revealed that the
proximal region of CiADAR1 promoter is the main regulatory region in CiADAR1
transcription.

The polysaccharide from the roots of Actinidia eriantha (AEPS), a potent
antitumor agent and immunological adjuvant, was investigated for the
immunomodulatory effects on RAW264.7 macrophages and its molecular mechanisms.
AEPS could significantly enhance the pinocytic and phagocytic activity, induce
the production of NO, TNF-a, IL-10, IL-1ß and IL-6, and promote the expression of
accessory and costimulatory molecules in RAW264.7 cells. PCR array assay revealed
that AEPS up-regulated 28 genes including TLRs (TLR2, TLR8, TLR9),
proinflammatory factors (IL-1ß, G-CSF, IL-1a, GM-CSF, IL-6, COX-2, TNF-a, IFN-ß, 
CXCL10, CCL2, TNF-ß, IL-10), and the genes involved in NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway,
and down-regulated 6 genes such as TLR3, TLR4, PGLYRP1, EIF2aK2, MAP3K1 and IRF1.
AEPS was further showed to promote cytoplasmic I<U+03BA>B-a degradation and increase
nuclear NF-<U+03BA>B p65 levels in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggested that AEPS
activated RAW264.7 macrophages and elicited a M1 and M2 response through
TLRs/NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway.

Macrophage tumoricidal activity relies, mainly, on the release of Tumor Necrosis 
Factor alpha (TNFa) and/or on reactive oxygen or nitrogen intermediates. In the
present work, we investigated the cytotoxic activity of resident peritoneal
macrophages against L929 fibrosarcoma cell line in vitro and in vivo. Resident
macrophages lysed L929 cells in a mechanism independent of TNFa and cell-to-cell 
contact. The cytotoxic activity was largely dependent on nitric oxide (NO)
release since treatment with L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) inhibited L929 cells killing.
Macrophages from mice with targeted deletion of inducible NO synthase (iNOS)
together with L929 cells produced less NO and displayed lower, but still
significant, tumoricidal activity. Notably, NO production and tumor lysis were
abolished in co-cultures with macrophages deficient in Interferon Regulatory
Factor, IRF-1. Importantly, the in vitro findings were reproduced in vivo as
IRF-1 deficient animals inoculated i.p with L929 cells were extremely susceptible
to tumor growth and their macrophages did not produce NO, while WT mice killed
L929 tumor cells and their macrophages produced high levels of NO. Our results
indicate that IRF-1 is a master regulator of bi-directional interaction between
macrophages and tumor cells. Overall, IRF-1 was essential for NO production by
co-cultures and macrophage tumoricidal activity in vitro as well as for the
control of tumor growth in vivo.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes and are
closely associated with the development of cancer. In fact, aberrant expression
of miRNAs has been implicated in numerous cancers. In cervical cancer, miR-203
levels are decreased, although the cause of this aberrant expression remains
unclear. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating
miR-203 gene transcription. We identify the miR-203 transcription start site by
5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and subsequently identify the miR-203
promoter region. Promoter analysis revealed that IRF1, a transcription factor,
regulates miR-203 transcription by binding to the miR-203 promoter. We also
demonstrate that miR-203 targets the 3' untranslated region of BANF1, thus
downregulating its expression, whereas miR-203 expression is driven by IRF1.
MiR-203 is involved in cell cycle regulation and overexpression of miR-203
suppresses cervical cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and
invasion. The inhibitory effect of miR-203 on the cancer cells is partially
mediated by downregulating its target, BANF1, since knockdown of BANF1 also
suppresses colony formation, migration and invasion.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Thyroid hormone (T3) and its receptor (TR) are involved in
cell growth and cancer progression. Although deregulation of microRNA (miRNA)
expression has been detected in many tumor types, the mechanisms underlying
functional impairment and specific involvement of miRNAs in tumor metastasis
remain unclear. In the current study, we aimed to elucidate the involvement of
deregulated miRNA-130b (miR-130b) and its target genes mediated by T3/TR in
cancer progression.
METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, luciferase and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays were performed to identify the miR-130b transcript and
the mechanisms implicated in its regulation. The effects of miR-130b on
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion were further examined in vitro and in
vivo. Clinical correlations among miR-130b, TRs and interferon regulatory factor 
1 (IRF1) were examined in HCC samples using Spearman correlation analysis.
RESULTS: Our experiments disclosed negative regulation of miR-130b expression by 
T3/TR. Overexpression of miR-130b led to marked inhibition of cell migration and 
invasion, which was mediated via suppression of IRF1. Cell migration ability was 
promoted by T3, but partially suppressed upon miR-130b overexpression.
Furthermore, miR-130b suppressed expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related genes, matrix metalloproteinase-9, phosphorylated mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR), p-ERK1/2, p-AKT and p-signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT)-3. Notably, miR-130b was downregulated in hepatoma samples
and its expression patterns were inversely correlated with those of TRa1 and
IRF1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data collectively highlight a novel pathway interlinking T3/TR, 
miR-130b, IRF1, the EMT-related genes, p-mTOR, p-STAT3 and the p-AKT cascade,
which regulates the motility and invasion of hepatoma cells.

Histone acetylation modulates gene expression and has been described as increased
in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF1) interactions that influence H4 acetylation (H4ac) in SLE.
Intracellular flow cytometry for H4 acetylated lysine (K) 5, K8, K12, and K16 was
performed. Histone acetylation was defined in monocytes and T cells from controls
and SLE patients. RNA-Seq studies were performed on monocytes to look for an
imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzyme
expression. Expression levels were validated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR.
IRF1 induction of H4ac was evaluated using D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. IRF1 
protein interactions were studied using co-immunoprecipitation assays.
IRF1-dependent recruitment of histone acetyltransferases to target genes was
examined by ChIP assays using p300 antibody. Flow cytometry data showed
significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16 acetylation in SLE
monocytes. HDAC3 and HDAC11 gene expression were decreased in SLE monocytes. PCAF
showed significantly higher gene expression in SLE than controls.
IRF1-overexpressing D54MG cells were associated with significantly increased
H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 acetylation compared to vector-control D54MG cells both
globally and at specific target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using D54MG
cells revealed IRF1 protein-protein interactions with PCAF, P300, CBP, GCN5,
ATF2, and HDAC3. ChIP experiments demonstrated increased p300 recruitment to
known IRF1 targets in D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. In contrast, p300 binding 
to IRF1 targets decreased in D54MG cells with IRF1 knockdown. SLE appears to be
associated with an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone
deacetylase enzymes favoring pathologic H4 acetylation. Furthermore, IRF1
directly interacts with chromatin modifying enzymes, supporting a model where
recruitment to specific target genes is mediated in part by IRF1.

To investigate the clinicopathological significance and underlying mechanism of
microRNA-29b (miR-29b) in colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of miR-29b was
investigated using in vivo and in vitro assays. Luciferase reporter assays were
conducted to determine the association between miR-29b and the insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF1) 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were employed to assess the direct binding of
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) to miR-29b. We found that interferon
(IFN)-<U+03B3> could induce miR-29b by recruiting IRF1 to binding sites in the miR-29b
promoter. A low level of miR-29b was significantly associated with an aggressive 
phenotype. MiR-29b inhibited CRC cell growth and invasion. IGF1, an activator of 
PI3K/Akt signaling, was confirmed as a novel target of miR-29b. Moreover, miR-29b
increased IRF1 expression, and the inhibition of miR-29b suppressed IFN-<U+03B3>-induced
apoptosis. We elucidated the potential signaling pathway,
IFN-<U+03B3>/IRF1/miR-29b/IGF1, and its implication for CRC tumorigenesis. A positive
feedback loop between IRF1 and miR-29b may contribute to the sensitivity of CRC
cells to IFN-<U+03B3>. Targeting miR-29b may provide a strategy for blocking CRC growth 
and metastasis.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) is a tumor suppressor that regulates cell
fate in several cell types. Here, we report an inverse correlation in expression 
of nuclear IRF1 and the autophagy regulator ATG7 in human breast cancer cells
that directly affects their cell fate. In mice harboring mutant Atg7, nuclear
IRF1 was increased in mammary tumors, spleen, and kidney. Mechanistic
investigations identified ATG7 and the cell death modulator beclin-1 (BECN1) as
negative regulators of IRF1. Silencing ATG7 or BECN1 caused estrogen receptor-a
to exit the nucleus at the time when IRF1 nuclear localization occurred.
Conversely, silencing IRF1 promoted autophagy by increasing BECN1 and blunting
IGF1 receptor and mTOR survival signaling. Loss of IRF1 promoted resistance to
antiestrogens, whereas combined silencing of ATG7 and IRF1 restored sensitivity
to these agents. Using a mathematical model to prompt signaling hypotheses, we
developed evidence that ATG7 silencing could resensitize IRF1-attenuated cells to
apoptosis through mechanisms that involve other estrogen-regulated genes.
Overall, our work shows how inhibiting the autophagy proteins ATG7 and BECN1 can 
regulate IRF1-dependent and -independent signaling pathways in ways that engender
a new therapeutic strategy to attack breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Despite of the common usage of glucocorticoids (GCs), a significant
portion of asthma patients exhibit GC insensitivity. This could be mediated by
diverse mechanisms, including genomics. Recent work has suggested that measuring 
changes in gene expression may provide more predictive information about GC
insensitivity than baseline gene expression alone, and that expression changes in
peripheral blood may be reflective of those in the airway.
METHODS: We performed in silico discovery using gene expression omnibus (GEO)
data that evaluated GC effect on gene expression in multiple tissue types.
Subsequently, candidate genes whose expression levels are affected by GC were
examined in cell lines and in primary cells derived from human airway and blood.
RESULTS: Through gene expression omnibus analysis, we identified interferon
regulator factor 1 (IRF1), whose expression is affected by GC treatment in airway
smooth muscle cells, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, and
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Significant IRF1 downregulation post GC
exposure was confirmed in two cultured airway epithelial cell lines and primary
NHBE cells (P<0.05). We observed large interindividual variation in GC-induced
IRF1 expression changes among primary NHBE cells tested. Significant
downregulation of IRF1 was also observed in six randomly selected LCLs (P<0.05), 
with variable degrees of downregulation among different samples. In peripheral
blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy volunteers, variable downregulation
of IRF1 by GC was also shown. NFKB1, a gene whose expression is known to be
downregulated by GC and the degree of downregulation of which is reflective of GC
response, was used as a control in our study. IRF1 shows more consistent
downregulation across tissue types when compared with NFKB1.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that GC-induced IRF1 gene expression changes in
peripheral blood could be used as a marker to reflect GC response in the airway.

Baicalein is a natural flavone that exhibits anticancer properties. Using
microarrays we found that DDIT4 was the highest transcript induced by baicalein
in cancer cells. We confirmed in multiple cancer cell lines large, dose-related
expression of DDIT4 by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot, which correlates with 
growth inhibition. Time course experiments demonstrate that DDIT4 is rapidly
inducible, with high expression maintained for several days in vitro. Induction
of DDIT4 expression is p53 independent based on evaluation of p53 knockout cells.
Since DDIT4 is known to inhibit mTORC1 activity we confirmed that baicalein
suppresses phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets. Using RNA interference we
demonstrate that mTORC1 activity and growth inhibition by baicalein is attenuated
by knockdown of DDIT4. We furthermore demonstrate suppression of established
tumors by baicalein in a mouse model of breast cancer with increased DDIT4
expression in the tumors. Finally, we demonstrate that baicalein upregulates
DDIT4 and causes mTORC1 and growth inhibition in platinum resistant cancer cells 
in marked contrast to platinum chemotherapy treatment. These studies demonstrate 
that baicalein inhibits mTORC1 through DDIT4 expression, and may be useful in
cancer chemotherapy and chemoprevention.

BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the genetic factors underlying juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is growing, but remains incomplete. Recently, a number
of novel genetic loci were reported to be associated with JIA at (or near)
genome-wide significance in a large case-control discovery sample using the
Immunochip genotyping array. However, independent replication of findings has yet
to be performed. We therefore attempted to replicate these newly identified loci 
in the Australian CLARITY JIA case-control sample.
FINDINGS: Genotyping was successfully performed on a total of 404 JIA cases (mean
age 6.4 years, 68% female) and 676 healthy child controls (mean age 7.1 years,
42% female) across 19 SNPs previously associated with JIA. We replicated a
significant association (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05, odds ratio (OR) in a direction consistent with

In mammals, type I IFNs (mainly IFN-a/ß) are primarily regulated by transcription
factors of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family. Fish IFNs do not show a
one-to-one orthologous relationship with mammalian type I IFN homologues. Using a
bacterial one-hybrid reporter screening system and an overexpression approach to 
explore the molecular mechanism underlying fish IFN induction, we identified
zebrafish Danio rerio IRF (DrIRF)1 as a positive regulator of the fish IFN
antiviral response. Among 12 zebrafish IRF family genes, DrIRF1 is most abundant 
in zebrafish immune tissues, including head kidney and spleen; upon virus
infection, it is one of most significantly induced genes. Overexpression of
DrIRF1 induces the expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes, hence protecting
epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells against spring viremia of carp virus
infection. As a transcription factor with constitutively nuclear retention,
DrIRF1 directly binds to the IFN-stimulated regulatory element/IRF-binding
element sites of zebrafish IFN promoters, which are dependent on four conserved
amino acids of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain helix a3 motif. Mutation of
either residue reveals a differential requirement for DrIRF1-mediated activation 
of zebrafish IFN<U+03D5>1 and IFN<U+03D5>3 promoters. Notably, C-terminal phosphorylation of
DrIRF1 is observed and is not required for in vitro binding of DrIRF1 to fish IFN
promoters. Unlike DrIRF3 and DrIRF7, which are responsible for differential
expression of zebrafish IFN<U+03D5>1 and IFN<U+03D5>3 through the retinoic acid-inducible gene 
I-like receptor pathway, DrIRF1 works in concert with MyD88 to activate zebrafish
IFN<U+03D5>3 but not IFN<U+03D5>1. These results provide insights into the evolving function of
IRF1 as a positive IFN regulator.

Interferons regulate immunity by inducing DNA binding of the transcription factor
STAT1 through Y701 phosphorylation. Transcription by STAT1 needs to be restricted
to minimize the adverse effects of prolonged immune responses. It remains unclear
how STAT1 inactivation is regulated such that the transcription output is
adequate. Here we show that efficient STAT1 inactivation in macrophages is
coupled with processive transcription. Ongoing transcription feeds back to reduce
the promoter occupancy of STAT1 and, consequently, the transcriptional output.
Once released from the promoter, STAT1 is ultimately inactivated by Y701
dephosphorylation. We observe similar regulation for STAT2 and STAT3, suggesting 
a conserved inactivation mechanism among STATs. These findings reveal that STAT1 
promoter occupancy in macrophages is regulated such that it decreases only after 
initiation of the transcription cycle. This feedback control ensures the fidelity
of cytokine responses and provides options for pharmacological intervention.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in sensing invading microbes by host
innate immunity. TLR2 recognizes bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides, and
lipopolysaccharide activates TLR4. TLR2 and TLR4 signal via the
Toll/interleukin-1 receptor adaptors MyD88 and MAL, leading to NF-<U+03BA>B activation. 
TLR4 also utilizes the adaptors TRAM and TRIF, resulting in activation of
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3. Here, we report a new role for TRAM and
TRIF in TLR2 regulation and signaling. Interestingly, we observed that
TLR2-mediated induction of the chemokine Ccl5 was impaired in TRAM or TRIF
deficient macrophages. Inhibition of endocytosis reduced Ccl5 release, and the
data also suggested that TRAM and TLR2 co-localize in early endosomes, supporting
the hypothesis that signaling may occur from an intracellular compartment. Ccl5
release following lipoprotein challenge additionally involved the kinase Tbk-1
and Irf3, as well as MyD88 and Irf1. Induction of Interferon-ß and Ccl4 by
lipoproteins was also partially impaired in cells lacking TRIF cells. Our results
show a novel function of TRAM and TRIF in TLR2-mediated signal transduction, and 
the findings broaden our understanding of how Toll/interleukin-1 receptor adaptor
proteins may participate in signaling downstream from TLR2.

apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine response.

Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) mimetics are considered
as promising anticancer therapeutics and used to induce apoptosis by antagonizing
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, which are often abundantly expressed in cancer
cells. Here, we identify interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) as a novel
critical regulator of Smac mimetic BV6-induced apoptosis and proinflammatory
cytokine secretion with impact on the immune response. IRF1 knockdown rescues
cells from BV6-induced apoptosis and attenuates BV6-stimulated upregulation of
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), indicating that IRF1 mediates BV6-triggered cell 
death, at least in part, by inducing TNFa. This notion is supported by data
showing that exogenous supply of TNFa restores BV6-induced cell death in
IRF-knockdown cells. Interestingly, IRF1 selectively controls the induction of
nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) target genes, as IRF1 depletion attenuates
BV6-stimulated upregulation of TNFa and interleukin-8 (IL-8) but not p100 and
RelB. Concomitant knockdown of IRF1 and p65 cooperate to inhibit BV6-induced cell
death, implying a cooperative interaction of IRF1 and NF-<U+03BA>B. In addition, IRF1
silencing hampers TNFa induction by TNFa itself as an another prototypical NF-<U+03BA>B 
stimulus. Importantly, IRF1 depletion impedes BV6-stimulated secretion of
additional proinflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-8, IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1, and migration of primary monocytes to BV6-treated tumor cells. In
conclusion, this identification of IRF1 as a dual regulator of BV6-induced
apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine secretion provides novel insights into
determinants of sensitivity towards Smac mimetic and possible implications of
Smac mimetic treatment on tumor microenvironment and immune response.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF1) is a potent antiviral, antitumor and immune
regulatory protein. Recently, we found that activated Ras/MEK inhibits antiviral 
response by downregulating IRF1 expression and renders cancer cells susceptible
to oncolytic viruses. In this study, we sought to determine whether IRF1
downregulation underlies oncogenesis induced by Ras/MEK activation in human
cancer cells. Treatment of the MEK inhibitor U0126 promoted IRF1 expression in 7 
of 11 cancer cell lines we tested. IRF1 promotion was also observed in human
cancer cell lines treated with different MEK inhibitors or with RNAi
oligonucleotides against extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).
Restoration of the expression of antitumor genes, p27 and p53 upregulated
modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), by MEK inhibition was less in IRF1 shRNA knockdown
cancer cells than in vector control cancer cells, suggesting that Ras/MEK targets
IRF1 for the downregulation of the antitumor genes. Moreover, apoptosis induction
by U0126 was significantly reduced in IRF1 shRNA knockdown cells than vector
control cells. This study demonstrates that IRF1 expression is suppressed by
activated Ras/MEK in human cancer cells and that IRF1 plays essential roles in
apoptosis induced by Ras/MEK inhibition.

Calcitriol, a powerful regulator of phosphate metabolism and immune response, is 
generated by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1a-hydroxylase in the kidney and macrophages.
Renal 1a-hydroxylase expression is suppressed by Klotho and FGF23, the expression
of which is stimulated by calcitriol. Interferon <U+03B3> (INF<U+03B3>) regulates
1a-hydroxylase expression in macrophages through transcription factor interferon 
regulatory factor-1. INF<U+03B3>-signaling includes Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) but a role of 
JAK3 in the regulation of 1a-hydroxylase expression and mineral metabolism has
not been shown. Thus, the impact of JAK3 deficiency on calcitriol formation and
phosphate metabolism was measured. Renal interferon regulatory factor-1 and
1a-hydroxylase transcript levels, serum calcitriol and FGF23 levels, intestinal
phosphate absorption as well as absolute and fractional renal phosphate excretion
were significantly higher in jak3 knockout than in wild-type mice. Coexpression
of JAK3 increased the phosphate-induced current in renal sodium-phosphate
cotransporter-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Thus, JAK3 is a powerful regulator of
1a-hydroxylase expression and phosphate transport. Its deficiency leads to marked
derangement of phosphate metabolism.

Interferon <U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) priming sensitizes monocytes and macrophages to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, resulting in augmented expression of a set 
of genes including TNF. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-<U+03B3> priming of LPS-stimulated
TNF transcription requires a distal TNF/LT locus element 8 kb upstream of the TNF
transcription start site (hHS-8). IFN-<U+03B3> stimulation leads to increased DNase I
accessibility of hHS-8 and its recruitment of interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1), and subsequent LPS stimulation enhances H3K27 acetylation and induces
enhancer RNA synthesis at hHS-8. Ablation of IRF1 or targeting the hHS-8 IRF1
binding site in vivo with Cas9 linked to the KRAB repressive domain abolishes
IFN-<U+03B3> priming, but does not affect LPS induction of the gene. Thus, IFN-<U+03B3> poises 
a distal enhancer in the TNF/LT locus by chromatin remodeling and IRF1
recruitment, which then drives enhanced TNF gene expression in response to a
secondary toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulus.

Signal integration between IFN<U+03B3> and TLRs in immune cells has been associated with
the host defense against pathogens and injury, with a predominant role of STAT1. 
We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in vascular cells
involved in cross-talk between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4, reflect pro-atherogenic responses
in human atherosclerosis. Genome-wide investigation identified a set of
STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between 
IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4 in VSMCs. These included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccrl2, 
Cxcl10 and Ccl5, adhesion molecules Cd40, Cd74, and antiviral and antibacterial
genes Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Among the amplified
genes was also Irf8, of which Ccl5 was subsequently identified as a new
pro-inflammatory target in VSMCs and ECs. Promoter analysis predicted
transcriptional cooperation between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NF<U+03BA>B, with the novel
role of IRF8 providing an additional layer to the overall complexity. The
synergistic interactions between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4 also resulted in increased T-cell 
migration and impaired aortic contractility in a STAT1-dependent manner.
Expression of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlated with STAT1
phosphorylation in vascular cells in plaques from human carotid arteries.
Moreover, using data mining of human plaque transcriptomes, expression of a
selection of these STAT1-dependent pro-atherogenic genes was found to be
increased in coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis. Our study
provides evidence to suggest that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1 orchestrates a platform 
for cross-talk between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4, and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene
signature that reflects a pro-atherogenic state in human atherosclerosis.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of severe lower
respiratory tract illness in young infants, the elderly and immunocompromised
individuals. We demonstrate here that the co-inhibitory molecule programmed cell 
death 1 (PD-1) is selectively upregulated on T cells within the respiratory tract
during both murine and human RSV infection. Importantly, the interaction of PD-1 
with its ligand PD-L1 is vital to restrict the pro-inflammatory activities of
lung effector T cells in situ, thereby inhibiting the development of excessive
pulmonary inflammation and injury during RSV infection. We further identify that 
PD-L1 expression on lung inflammatory dendritic cells is critical to suppress
inflammatory T-cell activities, and an interferon-STAT1-IRF1 axis is responsible 
for increased PD-L1 expression on lung inflammatory dendritic cells. Our findings
suggest a potentially critical role of PD-L1 and PD-1 interactions in the lung
for controlling host inflammatory responses and disease progression in clinical
RSV infection.

Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) make up a family of transcription factors
involved in transcriptional regulation of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes
(ISG) in cells. In the present study, an IRF2 gene (termed CiIRF2, JX628585) was 
cloned and characterized from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The
full-length cDNA of CiIRF2 is 1809<U+2009>bp in length, with the largest open reading
frame (ORF) of 981<U+2009>bp encoding a putative protein of 326 amino acids. CiIRF2
contains a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) in N-terminal and a non-conserved
C-terminal region. Protein sequence analysis revealed that CiIRF2 shares
significant homology to the known IRF2 counterparts. Phylogenetic reconstruction 
confirmed its closer evolutionary relationship with other fish counterparts,
especially with zebra fish IRF2. CiIRF2 was ubiquitously expressed at low level
in all tested grass carp tissues and significantly up-regulated except in brain
following poly I:C 6-12<U+2009>h post stimulation. In order to understand fish innate
immune and resistance to virus diseases, recombinant CiIRF2 with His-tag was
over-expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli, and the expressed protein was purified
by affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin. Promoter sequences of
grass carp type I IFN gene (CiIFN) and two ISG genes (CiPKR and CiPKZ) were
amplified and cloned. In vitro, gel mobility shift assays were employed to
analyze the interaction of CiIRF2 protein with promoters of CiIFN, CiPKR and
CiPKZ respectively. The results showed that CiIRF2 bound to these promoters with 
high affinity by means of its DBD. Afterwards, recombinant plasmids of
pGL3-CiIFN, pGL3-CiPKR and pGL3-CiPKZ were constructed and transiently
co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-CiIRF2 or pcDNA3.1-CiIRF1 respectively into
C.<U+2009>idella kidney (CIK) cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that
CiIRF2 down-regulates the transcription activity of CiIFN, CiPKR and CiPKZ genes 
in CIK cells. To further understand the function of fish IRF2, expression
plasmids (pcDNA3.1-IRF2 and pcDNA3.1-IRF1) were transiently co-transfected with
pGL3-IFN or pGL3-CiPKZ into CIK cells, respectively. The results revealed that
CiIRF2 plays an antagonistic role to CiIRF1 in transcriptional regulation of IFN 
and ISG genes.

Grass carp reovirus (GCRV)-induced gene 2 (Gig2) is recognized as a new antiviral
factor involved in response to viral infection. However, little is known about
the mechanisms behind the transcriptional regulation of Gig2 when infected by
virus. In this study, the upstream promoter region of grass carp
(Ctenopharyngodon idella) Gig2 gene (CiGig2) was identified by homology cloning
strategy. CiGig2 promoter sequence was found to be 859 bp in length and contained
three scattered IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE). In addition, some grass 
carp IRFs (CiIRF1, CiIRF2 and CiIRF3) ORF sequences were subcloned into the
expression plasmids pET-32a and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, then the
expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA
His-Bind Resin. Gel mobility shift assay was employed to screen the
transcriptional regulatory factor for CiGig2. The results revealed that the
recombinant polypeptides of CiIRF1, CiIRF2 and CiIRF3 bound to CiGig2 promoter
with high affinity; indicating that IRF1, IRF2 and IRF3 could be the potential
transcriptional regulatory factors for Gig2. Subsequently, CiGig2 promoter
sequence was cloned into pGL3-Basic vector and the ORFs of CiIRF1, CiIRF2 and
CiIRF3 were cloned into the expression plasmids pcDNA3.1 (+). Then, pGL3-CiGig2
promoter sequence and pcDNA3.1-CiIRFs were co-transfected into C. idella kidney
(CIK) cells. The in vivo effects of CiIRFs on CiGig2 promoter were measured by
dual-luciferase assays in the transfected CIK cells. Our results showed that the 
roles of CiIRFs were diversified in regulating CiGig2 transcription, e.g., CiIRF3
played a positive role in during this process; on the contrary CiIRF1 worked as a
suppressor; however the effect of CiIRF2 on CiGig2 transcription was not obvious.
For further study the roles of the three ISREs in CiGig2 transcription, we cloned
three mutant CiGig2 promoters called ISRE1mut-luc (deleted ISRE1), ISRE2mut-luc
(deleted ISRE2) and ISRE3mut-luc (deleted ISRE3), respectively. In vitro, gel
mobility shift assays showed that all three mutant promoters also were combined
with CiIRFs. CIK cells were co-transfected with CiGig2 promoter mutants
(ISRE1mut-luc, ISRE2mut-luc or ISRE3mut-luc, respectively) and pcDNA3.1-IRFs. The
results suggested that different ISRE played the diverse roles. ISRE2 is more
important than ISRE1 and ISRE3 to the transcription of CiGig2 induced by CiIRF1. 
ISRE1 and ISRE3 are important to the transcription of CiGig2 induced by CiIRF2
and CiIRF3.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene
expression. It has been reported that miRNAs are involved in host-virus
interaction, but evidence that cellular miRNAs promote virus replication has been
limited. Here, we found that miR-23a promoted the replication of human herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in HeLa cells, as demonstrated by a plaque-formation
assay and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1), an innate antiviral molecule, is targeted by miR-23a to facilitate viral 
replication. MiR-23a binds to the 3'UTR of IRF1 and down-regulates its
expression. Suppression of IRF1 expression reduced RSAD2 gene expression,
augmenting HSV-1 replication. Ectopic expression of IRF1 abrogated the promotion 
of HSV-1 replication induced by miR-23a. Notably, IRF1 contributes to innate
antiviral immunity by binding to IRF-response elements to regulate the expression
of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptosis, revealing a complex
interaction between miR-23a and HSV-1. MiR-23a thus contributes to HSV-1
replication through the regulation of the IRF1-mediated antiviral signal pathway,
which suggests that miR-23a may represent a promising target for antiviral
treatments.

OBJECTIVES: Epigenetic modifications play an important role in the regulation of 
gene transcription and cellular function. Here, we examined if pro-inflammatory
factors present in the inflamed joint of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
could regulate histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression and function in
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS).
METHODS: Protein acetylation in synovial tissue was assessed by
immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of HDAC family members and inflammatory
mediators in the synovial tissue and the changes in HDAC expression in RA FLS
were measured by quantitative (q) PCR. FLS were either transfected with HDAC5
siRNA or transduced with adenoviral vector encoding wild-type HDAC5 and the
effects of HDAC5 manipulation were examined by qPCR arrays, ELISA and ELISA-based
assays.
RESULTS: Synovial class I HDAC expression was associated with local expression of
tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and matrix metalloproteinase-1, while class IIa
HDAC5 expression was inversely associated with parameters of disease activity
(erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, Disease Activity Score in 28
Joints). Interleukin (IL)-1ß or TNF stimulation selectively suppressed HDAC5
expression in RA FLS, which was sufficient and required for optimal IFNB, CXCL9, 
CXCL10 and CXCL11 induction by IL-1ß, associated with increased nuclear
accumulation of the transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor 1(IRF1).
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory cytokines suppress RA FLS HDAC5 expression, promoting
nuclear localisation of IRF1 and transcription of a subset of type I interferon
response genes. Our results identify HDAC5 as a novel inflammatory mediator in
RA, and suggest that strategies rescuing HDAC5 expression in vivo, or the
development of HDAC inhibitors not affecting HDAC5 activity, may have therapeutic
applications in RA treatment.

Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is one of the major viral pathogens
causing disease in farmed Atlantic salmon worldwide. In the present work we show 
that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against
type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into 
an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the
Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one
(IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and 
VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation
of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of
IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling
cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the
catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to 
a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to
activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost
the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1
and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together 
these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic
properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 marks activated genes and can induce target gene
expression in systemic lupus erythematosus.

OBJECTIVE: Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) mediates both induction of
interferons (IFNs) and responses to type I IFNs. It has been implicated as a
critical mediator of inflammation in murine lupus models. In a previous study of 
chromatin modifications in monocytes from patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), IRF-1 was implicated as being associated with increased
histone acetylation in this disease. The present study was undertaken to directly
investigate IRF-1 binding sites on chromatin.
METHODS: Cells from 9 female SLE patients and 7 female controls were examined.
Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood and subjected to library
preparation using a validated antibody to IRF-1. IRF-1 binding sites on chromatin
were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The
effect of IRF-1 on target gene expression was confirmed using an overexpression
system in cell lines, and coimmunoprecipitation was used to identify protein
interactions.
RESULTS: IRF-1 binding around transcribed regions was increased in SLE patient
monocytes, but histone modifications at potential IRF-1 binding sites without
detectable IRF-1 binding were increased as well. Overexpression of IRF-1 was
sufficient to drive transcription of target genes. IRF-1 overexpression was also 
able to alter histone modifications at a focus set of target genes, and treatment
with an IRF-1 inhibitor reduced both expression and histone modifications at
target genes. IRF-1 was found to interact with a select set of histone-modifying 
enzymes and other transcription factors.
CONCLUSION: IRF-1 is an important signaling protein in the interferon pathway. It
not only activates gene expression as a transcription factor, but may perpetuate 
disease by leading to a dysregulated epigenome.

Interferons (IFNs) are key players in the antiviral response. IFN sensing by the 
cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an
antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the 
expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and
duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes.
However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding
transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the
expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not
with IFNa2 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels
of several well-characterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or
late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated
lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8, and 12
expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1, and IL6,
respectively, all related to the IFN response. These genes are induced in
response to different doses of IFNa2 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8)
or later (ISR12) time points. IFNß also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. 
ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN
response but not by other wild-type lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2
and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients
infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients
chronically infected with HIV. This is relevant as genome-wide
guilt-by-association studies predict that ISR2, 8, and 12 may function in viral
processes, in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. Therefore, we propose
that these lncRNAs could be induced by IFN to function as positive or negative
regulators of the antiviral response.

Oncolytic viruses exploit common molecular changes in cancer cells, which are not
present in normal cells, to target and kill cancer cells. Ras transformation and 
defects in type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses are known to be
the major mechanisms underlying viral oncolysis. Previously, we demonstrated that
oncogenic RAS/Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Ras/MEK) activation
suppresses the transcription of many IFN-inducible genes in human cancer cells,
suggesting that Ras transformation underlies type I IFN defects in cancer cells. 
Here, we investigated how Ras/MEK downregulates IFN-induced transcription. By
conducting promoter deletion analysis of IFN-inducible genes, namely
guanylate-binding protein 2 and IFN gamma inducible protein 47 (Ifi47), we
identified the IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) binding site as the promoter region
responsible for the regulation of transcription by MEK. MEK inhibition promoted
transcription of the IFN-inducible genes in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs), but not in IRF1(-/-) MEFs, showing that IRF1 is involved in MEK-mediated 
downregulation of IFN-inducible genes. Furthermore, IRF1 protein expression was
lower in RasV12 cells compared with vector control NIH3T3 cells, but was restored
to equivalent levels by inhibition of MEK. Similarly, the restoration of IRF1
expression by MEK inhibition was observed in human cancer cells. IRF1
re-expression in human cancer cells caused cells to become resistant to infection
by the oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus strain. Together, this work
demonstrates that Ras/MEK activation in cancer cells downregulates transcription 
of IFN-inducible genes by targeting IRF1 expression, resulting in increased
susceptibility to viral oncolysis.

IRF-1, a kind of transcription factors, is expressed constitutively in all cells 
types except early embryonal cells. By virtue of its interaction with specific
DNA sequence, IRF-1 regulates the transcription of a set of target genes which
play essential roles in various physiological and pathological processes,
including viral infection, tumor immune surveillance, pro-inflammatory injury,
development of immunity system. What's more, IRF-1 also interacts with other
transcription factors to regulate the specific genes transcription in the
nucleus. In immunity system, IRF-1 is suggested to provide a link between innate 
and adoptive immune system. Although IRF-1 has been demonstrated with essential
role in human immunity, the comprehensive understanding of the role of IRF-1 has 
been restrained because of extensive target genes, Here, we review the clinical
relevance of IRF-1 and underlying mechanism based on the latest researches.

OBJECTIVE: To study the involvement of variations in 4 genes associated with
susceptibility and/or protection against HIV-1 in serodiscordant couples in
Burkina Faso, namely, genes encoding HLA-B57, interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1), dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and CCR5
delta 32 (CCR5<U+0394>32).
METHODS: Two DC-SIGN and two IRF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well 
as HLA-B57*01 and CCR5<U+0394>32 alleles were genotyped in 51 serodiscordant couples in 
Burkina Faso. DC-SIGN, IRF1 and HLA-B57*01 genotyping was carried out by real
time PCR using TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, USA and Sacace Biotechnologies,
Italy). CCR5<U+0394>32 deletion was investigated by PCR.
RESULTS: The two SNPs of DC-SIGN promoter showed a significant genotypic
difference in serodiscordant couples. After multivariate analysis, only the
association between DC-SIGN rs2287886 and HIV-1 remained significant (P<0.01). No
association was found between IRF1 SNPs and HIV-1 infection. CCR5<U+0394>32 wild type
allele was found in 100% of serodiscordant couples. A high frequency of
HLA-B57*01 allele was found in the HIV-positive (78%) compared with HIV-negative 
group (51%), however this difference was no longer significant after the
correction of the sex confounding effect in the logistic regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a protective role of a variation of DC-SIGN
promoter and genetic resistance to HIV-1 in serodiscordant couples in Burkina
Faso.

Infection with certain pathogens induces a shift of the Th subset balance to a
Th1 dominant state. This, in turn, results in the suppression of Th2 responses.
We focused on the involvement of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in the
suppression of Th2 cells during Listeria infection. We found that the inhibition 
of IL-4 production by Th2 cells is mediated by a soluble factor (LmSN) produced
by Listeria-infected antigen-presenting cells. The inhibition is not observed
with T cells from Irf1 gene-targeted mice. IRF-1 suppresses transcription of the 
Il4 gene in Th2 cells. Under the influence of the LmSN, IRF-1 binds to the 3'
untranslated region (UTR) region of the Il4 gene and down-regulates Il4 gene
transcription. Finally, we identified IL-1a and IL-1ß as the mediator of the LmSN
activity. Signaling through IL-1R induces the stabilization and/or nuclear
translocation of IRF-1. We propose that IRF-1 functions to induce the T-cell
subset shift via a novel mechanism. Under the influence of IL-1, IRF-1
translocates into the nucleus and acts on the 3'UTR region of the Il4 gene, thus 
inhibiting its transcription in Th2 cells. As a result, the immune system shifts 
predominantly to a Th1 response during Listeria infection, resulting in effective
protection of the host.

The therapeutic efficacy of interferons (IFNs) in ulcerative colitis is minimal. 
However, IFN activity-associated molecules have been inadequately investigated.
Appendicitis and appendectomy (AA), when done while young, protect against
colitis development later. Our novel murine AA model protects against colitis.
This therapeutic target-identifying study enumerates IFN activity-associated
molecules involved in this protection. Mice with 2 laparotomies were controls
(sham-sham/SS). Distal colons were harvested (4 AA-group colons and 4 SS-group
colons). Microarray-analysis/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction-validation was done from RNA from each (3-days/28-days-post-AA). Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to analyze distal colonic gene
sets associated with 46 IFN activity-related genes. More AA-upregulated gene sets
were associated with IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IRF7, IFI35, and IFI44 (False Discovery
Rate-FDR <5% and P<0.001), although only IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFI44 showed
individual gene upregulation (P<0.05). More AA-downregulated gene sets were
associated with IRF1, IRF2, IRF4, IRF8, IRF9, IRF2BP1, IFRD1, IFRD2, and IFIH1
(FDR <5%/P<0.001); although only IRF2BP1 showed individual gene downregulation
(P<0.05). There was significant upregulation (P<0.05) of IFNZ; and downregulation
of IRF2BP2 and IFI30, despite no major associated GSEA differences. IFIT1, IFIT2,
IFIT3, and IFI44, with profound AA-induced individual/GSEA upregulation, and
their immunomodulatory/ antiproliferative activity, are the best molecules to
investigate therapeutic potential. IRF4, IRF8, IRF2BP1, IFRD1, and IFRD2, owing
to their profound AA-induced gene set downregulation, and because of their
diverse lymphocytic activity, are good targets to competitively inhibit or to
treat with exogenous products in knockout animals.

Helicobacter pylori infection not only induces gastric inflammation but also
increases the risk of gastric tumorigenesis. IFN-<U+03B3> has antimicrobial effects;
however, H. pylori infection elevates IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated gastric inflammation and may
suppress IFN-<U+03B3> signaling as a strategy to avoid immune destruction through an
as-yet-unknown mechanism. This study was aimed at investigating the mechanism of 
H. pylori-induced IFN-<U+03B3> resistance. Postinfection of viable H. pylori decreased
IFN-<U+03B3>-activated signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and IFN
regulatory factor 1 not only in human gastric epithelial MKN45 and AZ-521 but
also in human monocytic U937 cells. H. pylori caused an increase in the
C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation of Src homology-2 domain-containing
phosphatase (SHP) 2. Pharmacologically and genetically inhibiting SHP2 reversed
H. pylori-induced IFN-<U+03B3> resistance. In contrast to a clinically isolated H.
pylori strain HP238, the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) isogenic mutant
strain HP238(CagAm) failed to induce IFN-<U+03B3> resistance, indicating that CagA
regulates this effect. Notably, HP238 and HP238(CagAm) differently caused SHP2
phosphorylation; however, imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated
CagA-mediated membrane-associated binding with phosphorylated SHP2.
CagA-independent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributed to H.
pylori-induced SHP2 phosphorylation; however, ROS/SHP2 mediated IFN-<U+03B3> resistance 
in a CagA-regulated manner. This finding not only provides an alternative
mechanism for how CagA and ROS coregulate SHP2 activation but may also explain
their roles in H. pylori-induced IFN-<U+03B3> resistance.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a damaged
intestinal epithelium barrier. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and
osteopontin (OPN) regulate cell survival and growth in a variety of circumstances
but their effects on the intestinal epithelium have not been elucidated. In this 
study, we sought to determine the effects of OPN on intestinal epithelial cells
under conditions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a-induced inflammation and
whether IRF1 regulates OPN expression, the activation of downstream pathways, and
inflammatory responses.
METHODS: The expression levels of OPN and IRF1 were assessed by
immunohistochemical analyses of human IBD and experimental mouse colitis. The
effects of IRF1 and OPN on inflammatory responses were investigated in vitro in
NCM460 and Caco-2 cells stimulated by TNF-a. Changes in p-AKT, p-P38, and p-ERK
levels were quantified by western blotting assays. The regulation of OPN
expression by IRF1 was determined by luciferase activity and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays.
RESULTS: IRF1 was upregulated in human IBD and in the colon epithelium of mice
with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Additionally, IRF1 was correlated
with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Crohn's
disease activity index, Crohn's disease endoscopic index of severity, and simple 
endoscopic score for Crohn's disease in Crohn's disease and with high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Mayo score, Baron score,
modified Baron score, Rachmilewitz score, ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of 
severity, ulcerative colitis colonoscopic index of severity, and disease duration
in ulcerative colitis. The expression of OPN was significantly decreased in
patients with IBD compared with controls and in dextran sulfate sodium-induced
experimental colitis and was also inversely correlated with clinical and
endoscopic activities in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. TNF-a
treatment upregulated IRF1 and diminished OPN in both NCM460 and Caco-2 cells.
The overexpression of OPN and rhOPN ameliorated the apoptosis induced by TNF-a,
whereas the overexpression of IRF1 aggravated apoptosis, indicating opposite
effects of OPN and IRF1 in inflamed epithelial cells. The luciferase and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that IRF1 transcriptionally modulated
the expression of OPN. TNF-a inhibited the OPN-induced upregulation of p-ERK,
p-P38, and p-AKT.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that during intestinal inflammation, the
TNF-a-mediated activation of IRF1 is related to the subsequent suppression of OPN
expression, further reducing p-AKT, p-P38, and p-ERK activities and resulting in 
aggravation of the injury to intestinal epithelial cells.

Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) infection is a major trigger for asthma
exacerbations. Anti-viral immunity appears to be abnormal in asthma, with immune 
dysfunction reported in both airway structural cells and migratory, bone marrow
derived cells. Though decreased capacity to produce anti-viral interferons (IFNs)
has been reported in asthma, a detailed analysis of the molecular events involved
has not been undertaken.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the molecular pathway controlling type I IFN synthesis in
HRV-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from asthmatic and
healthy subjects.
METHODS: PBMC from 22 allergic asthmatics and 20 healthy donors were cultured
with HRV for 24 hours. Multiple components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR), IFN
regulatory and NF<U+03BA>ß pathways were compared at the mRNA and protein level.
RESULTS: Multiple deficiencies in the innate immune response to HRV were
identified in asthma, with significantly lower expression of IFNa, IFNß and
interferon stimulated genes than in healthy subjects. This was accompanied by
reduced expression of intra-cellular signalling molecules including interferon
regulatory factors (IRF1, IRF7), NF-<U+03BA>B family members (p50, p52, p65 and I<U+03BA>Ka)
and STAT1, and by reduced responsiveness to TLR7/TLR8 activation. These
observations could not be attributed to alterations in the numbers of dendritic
cell (DC) subsets in asthma or baseline expression of the viral RNA sensing
receptors TLR7/TLR8. In healthy subjects, blocking the activity of type-I IFN or 
depleting plasmacytoid DC recapitulated many of the abnormalities observed in
asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple abnormalities in innate anti-viral signalling pathways were
identified in asthma, with deficiencies in both IFN-dependent and IFN-independent
molecules identified.

Since February 2014, it is no longer possible to use low-dose rate 192 iridium
wires due to the end of industrial production of IRF1 and IRF2 sources. The
Brachytherapy Group of the French society of radiation oncology (GC-SFRO) has
recommended switching from iridium wires to after-loading machines. Two types of 
after-loading machines are currently available, based on the dose rate used:
pulsed-dose rate or high-dose rate. In this article, we propose a comparative
analysis between pulsed-dose rate and high-dose rate brachytherapy, based on
biological, technological, organizational and financial considerations.

Therapeutic targeting of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins by small-molecule 
inhibitors such as Smac mimetic is considered as a promising anticancer strategy 
to elicit apoptosis. Recent advances have renewed the interest in exploiting the 
antileukemic activity of interferon (IFN)a for the treatment of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Here, we identify a novel synergistic interaction of the Smac
mimetic BV6 and IFNa to trigger cell death in AML cells. Calculation of
combination index (CI) confirms the synergism of BV6 and IFNa. In contrast to AML
cells, no synergistic toxicity of BV6 and IFNa at equimolar concentrations is
found against normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. BV6 and IFNa act in concert to
stimulate expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a and its secretion into the
supernatant, thereby initiating an autocrine/paracrine TNFa/TNF receptor 1
(TNFR1) loop that drives cell death by BV6 and IFNa. Consistently,
pharmacological inhibition of TNFa by the TNFa-blocking antibody Enbrel or
genetic silencing of TNFR1 significantly reduces BV6/IFNa-induced cell death. In 
addition, BV6/IFNa-induced cell death depends on interferon regulatory factor
(IRF)1, since RNA interference-imposed knockdown of IRF1 significantly rescues
cell death. In conclusion, the identification of a novel synergistic antileukemic
combination of Smac mimetic and IFNa has important implications for the
development of innovative treatment strategies in AML.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a type I IFN (IFN-I)-driven autoimmune
disorder with exaggerated B and Th cell responses. Th17 cells, a recently
identified Th cell subset, have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of
SLE. Because IFN-I suppresses the generation and expansion of Th17 cells in an
IL-27-dependent manner, it is unclear how pathogenic Th17 cells are generated in 
SLE in the presence of an environment characterized by high IFN-I levels. In this
study, we showed that activation of c5aR on murine macrophages blocked
IFN-I-mediated IL-27 production, thus permitting the development of Th17 cells.
C5aR activation on IFN-I-responsive macrophages inhibits IRF-1-mediated
transactivation of IL-27 gene expression via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Consistently, 
C5aR-deficient mice exhibited increased IL-27 expression and fewer Th17 cells and
consequently developed reduced lupus nephritis in comparison with wild-type mice.
In support of these findings in mice, we found that C5a inhibited IFN-I-induced
IL-27 production from macrophages of lupus subjects. Moreover, the level of serum
C5a correlated with Th17 frequency in peripheral blood. Collectively, these data 
indicate an essential role for C5a in the generation of pathogenic Th17 responses
in SLE. Thus, therapeutic strategies to block C5aR activation may be beneficial
for controlling pathogenic Th17-mediated inflammation in SLE.

The family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) consists of nine members
(IRF1-IRF9) in mammals. They act as transcription factors for the interferons and
thus exert essential regulatory functions in the immune system and in
oncogenesis. Recent clinical and experimental studies have identified critically 
important roles of the IRFs in cardiovascular diseases, arising from their
participation in divergent and overlapping molecular programmes beyond the immune
response. Here we review the current knowledge of the regulatory effects and
mechanisms of IRFs on the immune system. The role of IRFs and their potential
molecular mechanisms as novel stress sensors and mediators of cardiovascular
diseases are highlighted.

Analysis of STAT1 expression and biological activity reveals
interferon-tau-dependent STAT1-regulated SOCS genes in the bovine endometrium.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are critical for
the regulation of numerous biological processes. In cattle, microarray analyses
identified STAT1 as a differentially expressed gene in the endometrium during the
peri-implantation period. To gain new insights about STAT1 during the oestrous
cycle and early pregnancy, we investigated STAT1 transcript and protein
expression, as well as its biological activity in bovine tissue and cells of
endometrial origin. Pregnancy increased STAT1 expression on Day 16, and protein
and phosphorylation levels on Day 20. In cyclic and pregnant females, STAT1 was
located in endometrial cells but not in the luminal epithelium at Day 20 of
pregnancy. The expression of STAT1 during the oestrous cycle was not affected by 
progesterone supplementation. In vivo and in vitro, interferon-tau (IFNT)
stimulated STAT1 mRNA expression, protein tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation in IFNT-stimulated endometrial
cells, we demonstrated an increase of STAT1 binding on interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF1), cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH), suppressor of 
cytokine signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS1, SOCS3) gene promoters consistent with the
induction of their transcripts. Our data provide novel molecular insights into
the biological functions of STAT1 in the various cells composing the endometrium 
during maternal pregnancy recognition and implantation.

Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants greatly elevate the risk of kidney
disease in African Americans. Here we report a cohort of patients who developed
collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis while receiving therapeutic
interferon, all of whom carried the APOL1 high-risk genotype. This finding raised
the possibility that interferons and the molecular pattern recognition receptors 
that stimulate interferon production may contribute to APOL1-associated kidney
disease. In cell culture, interferons and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists
increased APOL1 expression by up to 200-fold, in some cases with the appearance
of transcripts not detected under basal conditions. PolyI:C, a double-stranded
RNA TLR3 agonist, increased APOL1 expression by upregulating interferons directly
or through an interferon-independent, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent
pathway. Using pharmacological inhibitors, small hairpin RNA knockdown, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that the interferon-independent TLR3
pathway relied on signaling through TBK1, NF-<U+03BA>B, and Jak kinases, and on binding 
of IRF1, IRF2, and STAT2 at the APOL1 transcription start site. We also
demonstrate that overexpression of the APOL1 risk variants is more injurious to
cells than overexpression of the wild-type APOL1 protein. Our study illustrates
that antiviral pathways may be important inducers of kidney disease in
individuals with the APOL1 high-risk genotype and identifies potential targets
for prevention or treatment.

OBJECTIVE: In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) infiltration of immune
cells into muscle and upregulation of MHC-I expression implies increased antigen 
presentation and involvement of the proteasome system. To decipher the role of
immunoproteasomes in myositis, we investigated individual cell types and muscle
tissues and focused on possible immune triggers.
METHODS: Expression of constitutive (PSMB5, -6, -7) and corresponding
immunoproteasomal subunits (PSMB8, -9, -10) was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in
muscle biopsies and sorted peripheral blood cells of patients with IIM,
non-inflammatory myopathies (NIM) and healthy donors (HD). Protein analysis in
muscle biopsies was performed by western blot. Affymetrix HG-U133 platform
derived transcriptome data from biopsies of different muscle diseases and from
immune cell types as well as monocyte stimulation experiments were used for
validation, coregulation and coexpression analyses.
RESULTS: Real-time RT-PCR revealed significantly increased expression of
immunoproteasomal subunits (PSMB8/-9/-10) in DC, monocytes and CD8+ T-cells in
IIM. In muscle biopsies, the immunosubunits were elevated in IIM compared to NIM 
and exceeded levels of matched blood samples. Proteins of PSMB8 and -9 were found
only in IIM but not NIM muscle biopsies. Reanalysis of 78 myositis and 20 healthy
muscle transcriptomes confirmed these results and revealed involvement of the
antigen processing and presentation pathway. Comparison with reference profiles
of sorted immune cells and healthy muscle confirmed upregulation of PSMB8 and -9 
in myositis biopsies beyond infiltration related changes. This upregulation
correlated highest with STAT1, IRF1 and IFN<U+03B3> expression. Elevation of T-cell
specific transcripts in active IIM muscles was accompanied by increased
expression of DC and monocyte marker genes and thus reflects the cell type
specific involvement observed in peripheral blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunoproteasomes seem to indicate IIM activity and suggest that
dominant involvement of antigen processing and presentation may qualify these
diseases exemplarily for the evolving therapeutic concepts of immunoproteasome
specific inhibition.

IFNL1 (IL29), IFNL2 (IL28A) and IFNL3 (IL28B) might play important roles in
anti-viral defense. IFNL3 genotypes have been shown to be associated with
hepatitis C spontaneous and treatment-induced viral clearance. The effects of
IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 on innate immunity including Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-related pathway in human hepatocytes were examined. After G418 screening,
we established the human hepatoma stable cell lines HepG2-IL28A, HepG2-IL28B, and
HepG2-IL29, expressing IFNL2, IFNL3, and IFNL1 in conditioned medium,
respectively, and a control cell line, HepG2-pcDNA3.1. We performed real-time
RT-PCR to investigate 84 Toll-like receptor-related gene expressions in
triplicate and, using ddCt methods, compared these gene expressions in each cell 
line. IFNL2, IFNL3 and IFNL1 were respectively detected by ELISA in HepG2-IL28A, 
HepG2-IL28B and HepG2-IL29. Compared to HepG2-pcDNA3.1 cells, 17 (20.2%), 11
(13.0%) and 16 genes (19.0%) were up-regulated 1.5-fold or more (p<0.05); 10
(11.9%), 2 (2.3%) and 10 genes (11.9%) were 1.5-fold or more down-regulated
(p<0.05) in HepG2-IL28A, HepG2-IL28B and HepG2-IL29, respectively. EIF2AK2 and
SARM1 were up-regulated among all cells. Of interest, TLR3, TLR4 and related
molecules CXCL10 (IP10), IL6, EIF2K2, IFNB1, and IRF1, important genes in the
progression of HCV-related pathogenesis and antiviral activities against HCV, in 
HepG2-IL28B, presented different profiles from those of HepG2-IL28A and
HepG2-IL29. IFNL3 induces interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are reportedly 
associated with the progression of HCV-related pathogenesis and antiviral
activities against HCV. IFNL is a powerful modulator of innate immune response
and it is supposed that the 3 IFNLs may play different roles in the antiviral
activity against HBV and HCV.

Synergistic activation of inflammatory cytokine genes by interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) and
Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is important for innate immunity and
inflammatory disease pathogenesis. Enhancement of TLR signaling, a previously
proposed mechanism, is insufficient to explain strong synergistic activation of
cytokine production in human macrophages. Rather, we found that IFN-<U+03B3> induced
sustained occupancy of transcription factors STAT1, IRF-1, and associated histone
acetylation at promoters and enhancers at the TNF, IL6, and IL12B loci. This
priming of chromatin did not activate transcription but greatly increased and
prolonged recruitment of TLR4-induced transcription factors and RNA polymerase II
to gene promoters and enhancers. Priming sensitized cytokine transcription to
suppression by Jak inhibitors. Genome-wide analysis revealed pervasive priming of
regulatory elements by IFN-<U+03B3> and linked coordinate priming of promoters and
enhancers with synergistic induction of transcription. Our results provide a
synergy mechanism whereby IFN-<U+03B3> creates a primed chromatin environment to augment
TLR-induced gene transcription.

BACKGROUND: HMLEs (HMLE-SNAIL and Kras-HMLE, Kras-HMLE-SNAIL pairs) serve as
excellent model system to interrogate the effect of SNAIL targeted agents that
reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We had earlier developed a
SNAIL-p53 interaction inhibitor (GN-25) that was shown to suppress SNAIL
function. In this report, using systems biology and pathway network analysis, we 
show that GN-25 could cause reversal of EMT leading to mesenchymal-to-epithelial 
transition (MET) in a well-recognized HMLE-SNAIL and Kras-HMLE-SNAIL models.
RESULTS: GN-25 induced MET was found to be consistent with growth inhibition,
suppression of spheroid forming capacity and induction of apoptosis. Pathway
network analysis of mRNA expression using microarrays from GN-25 treated
Kras-HMLE-SNAIL cells showed an orchestrated global re-organization of EMT
network genes. The expression signatures were validated at the protein level
(down-regulation of mesenchymal markers such as TWIST1 and TWIST2 that was
concurrent with up-regulation of epithelial marker E-Cadherin), and RNAi studies 
validated SNAIL dependent mechanism of action of the drug. Most importantly,
GN-25 modulated many major transcription factors (TFs) such as inhibition of
oncogenic TFs Myc, TBX2, NR3C1 and led to enhancement in the expression of tumor 
suppressor TFs such as SMAD7, DD1T3, CEBPA, HOXA5, TFEB, IRF1, IRF7 and XBP1,
resulting in MET as well as cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systems and network investigations provide convincing
pre-clinical evidence in support of the clinical application of GN-25 for the
reversal of EMT and thereby reducing cancer cell aggressiveness.

Viruses suppress host responses to increase infection, and understanding these
mechanisms has provided insights into cellular signaling and led to novel
therapies. Many viruses (e.g., Influenza virus, Rhinovirus [RV], Cytomegalovirus,
Epstein-Barr virus, and Hepatitis C virus) activate epithelial epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase receptor, but the role of EGFR in viral
pathogenesis is not clear. Interferon (IFN) signaling is a critical innate
antiviral host response and recent experiments have implicated IFN-<U+03BB>, a type III 
IFN, as the most significant IFN for mucosal antiviral immune responses. Despite 
the importance of IFN-<U+03BB> in epithelial antiviral responses, the role and
mechanisms of epithelial IFN-<U+03BB> signaling have not been fully elucidated. We
report that respiratory virus-induced EGFR activation suppresses endogenous
airway epithelial antiviral signaling. We found that Influenza virus- and
RV-induced EGFR activation suppressed IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 1-induced IFN-<U+03BB>
production and increased viral infection. In addition, inhibition of EGFR during 
viral infection augmented IRF1 and IFN-<U+03BB>, which resulted in decreased viral
titers in vitro and in vivo. These findings describe a novel mechanism that
viruses use to suppress endogenous antiviral defenses, and provide potential
targets for future therapies.

HIV and interferon regulatory factor 1: a story of manipulation and control.

Members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family control the expression
of numerous proteins, many of which are central to regulating host immune
responses. IRF1 is one of the central mediators of the innate and adaptive immune
responses required for antigen processing and presentation, Th1/Th2
differentiation, and natural killer (NK) cell and macrophage function. Many
viruses have evolved mechanisms to target the IRF1 pathway in order to promote
viral pathogenesis. During early HIV infection, IRF1 acts as a double-edged
sword, critical for driving viral replication as well as eliciting antiviral
responses. In this review, we describe the strategies that HIV-1 has evolved to
modulate IRF1 in order to enhance viral replication and to disarm the host immune
system. IRF1 has been shown to be an important factor in natural protection
against HIV in highly exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals and is crucial in
regulating the initial stages of HIV replication and HIV disease progression, as 
well as the establishment of latency. An understanding of how the protective
effects of IRF1 responses are controlled in HESN individuals, naturally resistant
to HIV infection, may provide important clues on how to regain control of HIV and
tip the balance of immunity in favor of the host, or provide new opportunities to
eliminate HIV in its host altogether.

Expression of the immune regulator tripartite-motif 21 is controlled by IFN
regulatory factors.

Tripartite-motif 21 (TRIM21) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates innate
immune responses by ubiquitinating IFN regulatory factors (IRFs). TRIM21 is
mainly found in hematopoietic cells in which its expression is induced by IFNs
during viral. infections and in systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. However, the exact molecular
mechanism by which the expression of the Trim21 gene is regulated is unknown. In 
this study, we demonstrate that IFNs induce Trim21 expression in immune cells via
IRFs and that IFN-a and IFN-ß are the most potent inducers of Trim21. A
functional IFN-stimulated response element but no conserved IFN-<U+03B3>-activated site 
was detected in the promoter of Trim21. IRF1 and IRF2 strongly induced Trim21
expression in an IFN-stimulated response element-dependent manner, whereas IRF4
and IRF8 strongly repressed the IRF1-mediated induction of Trim21. Consistent
with this observation, baseline expression of Trim21 was elevated in Irf4(-/-)
cells. TRIM21, IRF1, and IRF2 expression was increased in PBMCs from patients
with Sjögren's syndrome compared with healthy controls. In contrast, IRF4 and
IRF8 expression was not increased in PBMCs from patients. The IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated
induction of Trim21 was completely abolished by inhibiting protein synthesis with
cycloheximide, and Trim21 expression could not be induced by IFN-<U+03B3> in Irf1(-/-)
cells, demonstrating that IFN-<U+03B3> induces Trim21 indirectly via IRF1 and not
directly via STAT1 activation. Our data demonstrate that multiple IRFs tightly
regulate expression of Trim21 in immune cells, suggesting that a well-controlled 
expression of the E3 ligase TRIM21 is important for regulation of immune
responses.

Hepatitis C virus replication in mouse cells is restricted by IFN-dependent and
-independent mechanisms.

Research, Braunschweig, Germany.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Current treatment strategies for hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection include pegylated interferon (IFN)-alfa and ribavirin. Approximately
50% of patients control HCV infection after treatment, but the broad range of
patients' outcomes and responses to treatment, among all genotypes, indicates a
role for host factors. Although the IFN system is important in limiting HCV
replication, the virus has evolved mechanisms to circumvent the IFN response.
However, direct, IFN-independent antiviral processes also might help control HCV 
replication. We examined the role of IFN-independent responses against HCV
replication.
METHODS: We analyzed replication of the subgenomic JFH1 replicon in embryonic
fibroblasts and primary hepatocytes from mice with disruptions in genes encoding 
factors in the IFN-dependent and alternative antiviral pathways (signal
transducers and activators of transcription 1 [STAT1], protein kinase R,
interferon regulatory factors (IRF) IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-5, IRF-7, mitochondrial
antiviral signaling molecule [MAVS], and IFN receptor [IFNAR]). We also assessed 
the effects of expression of these factors by mouse primary hepatocytes on HCV
replication.
RESULTS: In addition to IRF-3- and IFN-mediated antiviral responses,
IFN-independent, but IRF-1- and IRF-5-dependent mechanisms, restrict HCV
replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In primary hepatocytes these
IFN-independent require MAVS and IRF-1.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV replication is limited by interferon-mediated pathways as well
pathways that are independent of type I IFNs. IRF1 and IRF5 control
IFN-independent signaling events that lead to antiviral responses. We observed
antiviral roles of IRF1 and IRF5 that were IFN-independent and cell-type
specific. These mechanisms are important in controlling viruses that interfere
with the IFN signaling because cells retain the ability to induce functional but 
local antiviral states through expression of interferon-stimulated genes.

Immunoproteasome Activation During Early Antiviral Response in Mouse Pancreatic
ß-cells: New Insights into Auto-antigen Generation in Type I Diabetes?

Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing
pancreatic ß-cells. The immunoproteasome, a version of the proteasome that
collaborates with the 11S/PA28 activator to generate immunogenic peptides for
presentation by MHC class I molecules, has long been implicated in the onset of
the disease, but little is known about immunoproteasome function and regulation
in pancreatic ß-cells. Interesting insight into these issues comes from a recent 
analysis of the immunoproteasome expressed in pancreatic ß-cells during early
antiviral defenses mediated by interferon ß (IFNß), a type I IFN implicated in
the induction of the diabetic state in human and animal models. Using mouse
islets and the MIN6 insulinoma cell line, Freudenburg et al. found that IFNß
stimulates expression of the immunoproteasome and the 11S/PA28 activator in a
manner fundamentally similar to the classic immuno-inducer IFN<U+03B3>, with similar
timing of mRNA accumulation and decline; similar transcriptional activation
mediated primarily by the IRF1 and similar mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, 
neither IFNß nor IFN<U+03B3> altered the expression of regular proteolytic subunits or
prevented their incorporation into proteolytic cores. As a result,
immunoproteasomes had stochastic combinations of immune and regular proteolytic
sites, an arrangement that would likely increase the probability with which
unique immunogenic peptides are produced. However, immunoproteasomes were
activated by the 11S/PA28 only under conditions of ATP depletion. A mechanism
that prevents the activation of immunoproteasome at high ATP levels has not been 
reported before and could have a major regulatory significance, as it could
suppress the generation of immunogenic peptides as cell accumulate
immunoproteasome and 11S/PA28, and activate antigen processing only when ATP
levels drop. We discuss implications of these new findings on the link between
early antiviral response and the onset of type 1 diabetes.

The role of Group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2a) activation in
regulating macrophage transcriptional responses to Candida albicans infection was
investigated. cPLA2a releases arachidonic acid for the production of eicosanoids.
In mouse resident peritoneal macrophages, prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2 and
leukotriene C4 were produced within minutes of C. albicans addition before
cyclooxygenase 2 expression. The production of TNFa was lower in C.
albicans-stimulated cPLA2a(+/+) than cPLA2a(-/-) macrophages due to an autocrine 
effect of prostaglandins that increased cAMP to a greater extent in cPLA2a(+/+)
than cPLA2a(-/-) macrophages. For global insight, differential gene expression in
C. albicans-stimulated cPLA2a(+/+) and cPLA2a(-/-) macrophages (3 h) was compared
by microarray. cPLA2a(+/+) macrophages expressed 86 genes at lower levels and 181
genes at higher levels than cPLA2a(-/-) macrophages (=2-fold, p<0.05). Several
pro-inflammatory genes were expressed at lower levels (Tnfa, Cx3cl1, Cd40, Ccl5, 
Csf1, Edn1, CxCr7, Irf1, Irf4, Akna, Ifn<U+03B3>, several IFN<U+03B3>-inducible GTPases). Genes
that dampen inflammation (Socs3, Il10, Crem, Stat3, Thbd, Thbs1, Abca1) and genes
involved in host defense (Gja1, Csf3, Trem1, Hdc) were expressed at higher levels
in cPLA2a(+/+) macrophages. Representative genes expressed lower in cPLA2a(+/+)
macrophages (Tnfa, Csf1) were increased by treatment with a prostacyclin receptor
antagonist and protein kinase A inhibitor, whereas genes expressed at higher
levels (Crem, Nr4a2, Il10, Csf3) were suppressed. The results suggest that C.
albicans stimulates an autocrine loop in macrophages involving cPLA2a,
cyclooxygenase 1-derived prostaglandins and increased cAMP that globally effects 
expression of genes involved in host defense and inflammation.

Shear stress modulates VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF-a and dietary lipids 
via interferon regulatory factor-1 in cultured endothelium.

Dyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the
specific mechanisms that determine the localization of atherosclerotic plaques in
arteries are not well defined. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) isolated
from human plasma after a high-fat meal modulate TNF-a-induced VCAM-1 expression 
in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) via an interferon regulatory
factor (IRF)-1-dependent transcriptional mechanism. We examined whether fluid
shear stress acts as a mediator of IRF-1-dependent VCAM-1 expression in response 
to cytokine and dietary lipids. IRF-1 and VCAM-1 were examined by
immunofluorescence in TNF-a-stimulated HAEC monolayers exposed to TGRL and a
linear gradient of shear stress ranging from 0 to 16 dyn/cm(2) in a microfluidic 
device. Shear stress alone modulated TNF-a-induced VCAM-1 expression, eliciting a
150% increase at low shear stress (2 dyn/cm(2)) and a 70% decrease at high shear 
stress (12 dyn/cm(2)) relative to static. These differences correlated with a 60%
increase in IRF-1 expression under low shear stress and a 40% decrease under high
shear stress. The addition of TGRL along with cytokine activated a fourfold
increase in VCAM-1 expression and a twofold increase in IRF-1 expression. The
combined effect of shear stress and TGRL on the upregulation of membrane VCAM-1
was abolished by transfection of HAECs with IRF-1-specific small interfering RNA.
In a healthy swine model, elevated levels of endothelial IRF-1 were also observed
within atherosusceptible regions of the aorta by Western blot analysis and
immunohistochemistry, implicating arterial hemodynamics in the regulation of
IRF-1 expression. These data demonstrate direct roles for fluid shear stress and 
postprandial TGRL from human serum in the regulation of IRF-1 expression and
downstream inflammatory responses in HAECs.

Clinically relevant dimer interface mutants of STAT1 transcription factor exhibit
differential gene expression.

Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.

A transition from a parallel to an antiparallel dimer configuration of the
transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
is required for interferon (IFN)-mediated signal transduction. However, the
precise molecular mechanisms linking conformational changes to target gene
activation by STAT1 are still largely unknown. In the present study, we have
characterized, in more detail than before, two disease-associated point mutants
with amino acid substitutions at both sites of the dimer interface (F172W and
T385A). First, we confirmed that IFN<U+03B3>-stimulation of transfected cells led to
enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of mutant STAT1 as compared to the wild-type
protein, which consequently resulted in its prolonged nuclear accumulation. Using
an in vitro dephosphorylation assay, we demonstrated that, in contrast to
wild-type STAT1 and similar to the F172W mutant, also T385A resisted enzymatic
inactivation by the nuclear phosphatase Tc45. Transcriptional activation of
IFN<U+03B3>-driven endogenous target genes differed between wild-type and mutant STAT1. 
While expression of genes containing a single classical gamma-activated site
(GAS), such as irf1, gpb1, and mig1, was virtually unaffected by the presence of 
either of two amino acid exchanges, induction of the cxcl10 and mcp1 gene was
significantly enhanced. The latter two genes both contain an additional TTC/GAA
binding motif separated by 10 bp from the palindromic GAS sequence. The
transcriptional superiority of the mutants on these genes was reflected by their 
increased binding affinity to DNA fragments containing the identified
"one-and-a-half-GAS" motif. In summary, our data demonstrate that two clinically 
relevant interface mutants of STAT1 exhibit gene-specific effects and point to
the rather complex role of the assumed conformational shift between two different
dimer configurations for efficient transcriptional regulation.

Infection of salmonids by the myxozoan parasite Myxobolus cerebralis can cause
whirling disease, which is responsible for high mortalities in rainbow trout
hatcheries and natural populations in the United States. Although considerable
research has provided insight into disease pathology, host invasion, and
inheritance patterns of resistance, the causal genetic variants and molecular
mechanisms underlying host resistance or susceptibility remain elusive. A
previous study found that expression changes of specific metallothionein genes
following M. cerebralis infection are implicated in whirling disease resistance. 
The present study examines the dynamic transcriptional response to infection of
several upstream regulators of the metallothionein gene family (IL-1ß, KLF2,
STAT3, STAT5), along with innate immune response genes (IFN-<U+03B3>, IRF1 and iNOS).
Pathogen loads and gene expression were compared across multiple time points
after M. cerebralis exposure to elucidate how resistant and susceptible rainbow
trout strains transcriptionally respond to early invasion. IL-1ß, IFN-<U+03B3>, IRF1,
and iNOS all showed increased expression following M. cerebralis exposure for one
or both strains across multiple time points. The interferon-related genes IFN-<U+03B3>
and IRF1 had consistently increased expression in the susceptible strain in
comparison to the resistant strain, likely due to a less effective initial immune
response. STAT3 was the only gene with consistently increased expression in the
resistant strain following infection while remaining unchanged in the susceptible
strain. Given its pleiotropic effects on immune response, STAT3 is an excellent
candidate for future research of whirling disease resistance mechanisms.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) is required for development, maturation and
expression of anti-microbial defenses of myeloid cells. BXH2 mice harbor a
severely hypomorphic allele at Irf8 (Irf8(R294C)) that causes susceptibility to
infection with intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We
report that BXH2 are completely resistant to the development of cerebral malaria 
(ECM) following Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection. Comparative transcriptional
profiling of brain RNA as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and
high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify IRF8-regulated genes
whose expression is associated with pathological acute neuroinflammation. Genes
increased by infection were strongly enriched for IRF8 binding sites, suggesting 
that IRF8 acts as a transcriptional activator in inflammatory programs. These
lists were enriched for myeloid-specific pathways, including interferon
responses, antigen presentation and Th1 polarizing cytokines. We show that
inactivation of several of these downstream target genes (including the Irf8
transcription partner Irf1) confers protection against ECM. ECM-resistance in
Irf8 and Irf1 mutants is associated with impaired myeloid and lymphoid cells
function, including production of IL12p40 and IFN<U+03B3>. We note strong overlap
between genes bound and regulated by IRF8 during ECM and genes regulated in the
lungs of M. tuberculosis infected mice. This IRF8-dependent network contains
several genes recently identified as risk factors in acute and chronic human
inflammatory conditions. We report a common core of IRF8-bound genes forming a
critical inflammatory host-response network.

Transient oscillatory dynamics of interferon beta signaling in macrophages.

Pertsovskaya I, Abad E, Domedel-Puig N, Garcia-Ojalvo J, Villoslada P.

BACKGROUND: Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) activates the immune response through the 
type I IFN signaling pathway. IFN-beta is important in the response to pathogen
infections and is used as a therapy for Multiple Sclerosis. The mechanisms of
self-regulation and control of this pathway allow precise and
environment-dependent response of the cells in different conditions. Here we
analyzed type I IFN signaling in response to IFN-beta in the macrophage cell line
RAW 264.7 by RT-PCR, ELISA and xMAP assays. The experimental results were
interpreted by means of a theoretical model of the pathway.
RESULTS: Phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein (pSTAT1) and mRNA levels of the
pSTAT1 inhibitor SOCS1 displayed an attenuated oscillatory behavior after
IFN-beta activation. In turn, mRNA levels of the interferon regulatory factor
IRF1 grew rapidly in the first 50-90 minutes after stimulation until a maximum
value, and started to decrease slowly around 200-250 min. The analysis of our
kinetic model identified a significant role of the negative feedback from SOCS1
in driving the observed damped oscillatory dynamics, and of the positive feedback
from IRF1 in increasing STAT1 basal levels. Our study shows that the system works
as a biological damped relaxation oscillator based on a
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation network centered on STAT1. Moreover, a
bifurcation analysis identified translocation of pSTAT1 dimers to the nucleus as 
a critical step for regulating the dynamics of type I IFN pathway in the first
steps, which may be important in defining the response to IFN-beta therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The immunomodulatory effect of IFN-beta signaling in macrophages
takes the form of transient oscillatory dynamics of the JAK-STAT pathway, whose
specific relaxation properties determine the lifetime of the cellular response to
the cytokine.

Leishmania major inhibits IL-12 in macrophages by signalling through CR3
(CD11b/CD18) and down-regulation of ETS-mediated transcription.

Leishmania major is an aetiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The
parasite primarily infects immune sentinel cells, specifically macrophages and
dendritic cells, in the mammalian host. Infection is receptor mediated and is
known to involve parasite binding to cell surface protein complement receptor 3
(CR3, Mac-1, CD11b/CD18). Engagement of CR3 by various ligands inhibits
production of interleukin-12 (IL-12), the cytokine that drives antileishmanial T 
helper 1-type immune responses. Likewise, L. major infection inhibits IL-12
production and activation of host macrophages. Our data indicate that in the
absence of CR3, L. major-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages produce more
IL-12 and nitric oxide compared with WT cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
stimulation. We therefore investigated multiple signalling pathways by which L.
major may inhibit IL-12 transcription through CR3 ligation. We demonstrate that
L. major infection does not elicit significant NF<U+03BA>B p65, MAPK, IRF-1 or IRF-8
activation in WT or CD11b-deficient macrophages. Furthermore, infection neither
inhibits LPS-induced MAPK or NF<U+03BA>B activation nor blocks IFN-<U+03B3>-activated IRF-1 and
IRF-8. ETS-mediated transcription, however, is inhibited by L. major infection
independently of CR3. Our data indicate that L. major-mediated inhibition of
IL-12 occurs through CR3 engagement; however, the mechanism of inhibition is
independent of NF<U+03BA>B, MAPK, IRF and ETS.

treatment", Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute, Villejuif, France.

BACKGROUND: Molecular segmentation of breast cancer allows identification of
small groups of patients who present high sensitivity to targeted agents. A
patient, with chemo- and trastuzumab-resistant HER2-overexpressing breast cancer,
who presented concomitant acute promyelocytic leukemia, showed a response in her 
breast lesions to retinoic acid, arsenic, and aracytin. We therefore investigated
whether RARA gene amplification could be associated with sensitivity to retinoic 
acid derivatives in breast cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridization and gene
expression arrays were used to characterize RARA amplifications and expression in
103 breast cancer samples. In vitro activity of ATRA was characterized in T47D,
SKBR3, and BT474 cell lines.
RESULTS: Retinoic acid receptor alpha was gained or amplified in 27% of
HER2-positive and 13% of HER2-negative breast cancer samples. Retinoic acid
receptor alpha can be coamplified with HER2. Retinoic acid receptor alpha copy
number changes could be correlated with messenger RNA expression.
All-trans-retinoic acid reduced cell viability of RARA-amplified, but not
RARA-normal, cell lines through apoptosis. Gene expression arrays showed that
ATRA-induced apoptosis in RARA-amplified cell lines was related to an increase in
CASP1 and IRF1.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that breast cancers exhibiting RARA
amplifications could be sensitive to retinoic acid. A phase II trial will
evaluate this hypothesis in the clinical setting.

IFN<U+03B3> influences type I interferon response and susceptibility to Theiler's
virus-induced demyelinating disease.

Bowen JL(1), Olson JK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurological Surgery, School of Medicine and Public Health,
University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces a demyelinating disease
in susceptible SJL mice that has similarities to multiple sclerosis in humans.
TMEV infection of susceptible mice leads to a persistent virus infection of the
central nervous system (CNS), which promotes the development of demyelinating
disease associated with an inflammatory immune response in the CNS. TMEV
infection of resistant C57BL6 mice results in viral clearance without development
of demyelinating disease. Interestingly, TMEV infection of resistant mice
deficient in IFN<U+03B3> leads to a persistent virus infection in the CNS and
development of demyelinating disease. We have previously shown that the innate
immune response affects development of TMEV- induced demyelinating disease, thus 
we wanted to determine the role of IFN<U+03B3> during the innate immune response.
TMEV-infected IFN<U+03B3>-deficient mice had an altered innate immune response,
including reduced expression of innate immune cytokines, especially type I
interferons. Administration of type I interferons, IFNa and IFNß, to
TMEV-infected IFN<U+03B3>-deficient mice during the innate immune response restored the 
expression of innate immune cytokines. Most importantly, administration of type I
interferons to IFN<U+03B3>-deficient mice during the innate immune response decreased
the virus load in the CNS and decreased development of demyelinating disease.
Microglia are the CNS resident immune cells that express innate immune receptors.
In TMEV-infected IFN<U+03B3>-deficient mice, microglia had reduced expression of innate 
immune cytokines, and administration of type I interferons to these mice restored
the innate immune response by microglia. In the absence of IFN<U+03B3>, microglia from
TMEV-infected mice had reduced expression of some innate immune receptors and
signaling molecules, especially IRF1. These results suggest that IFN<U+03B3> plays an
important role in the innate immune response to TMEV by enhancing the expression 
of innate immune cytokines, especially type I interferons, which directly affects
the development of demyelinating disease.

Rotavirus NSP1 mediates degradation of interferon regulatory factors through
targeting of the dimerization domain.

Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

Rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP1 can inhibit expression of interferon (IFN)
and IFN-stimulated gene products by inducing proteasome-mediated degradation of
IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs), including IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7. All IRF proteins
share an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD), and IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 contain a 
similar C-proximal IRF association domain (IAD) that mediates IRF dimerization.
An autoinhibitory domain (ID) at the extreme C terminus interacts with the IAD,
burying residues necessary for IRF dimerization. Phosphorylation of
serine/threonine residues in the ID induces charge repulsions that unmask the
IAD, enabling IRF dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation. To define
the region of IRF proteins targeted for degradation by NSP1, we generated IRF3
and IRF7 truncation mutants and transiently expressed each with simian SA11-4F
NSP1. These assays indicated that the IAD represented a necessary and sufficient 
target for degradation. Because NSP1 did not mediate degradation of truncated
forms of the IAD, NSP1 likely requires a structurally intact IAD for recognition 
and targeting of IRF proteins. IRF9, which contains an IAD-like region that
directs interactions with signal inducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
proteins, was also targeted for degradation by NSP1, while IRF1, which lacks an
IAD, was not. Analysis of mutant forms of IRF3 unable to undergo dimerization or 
that were constitutively dimeric showed that both were targeted for degradation
by NSP1. These results indicate that SA11-4F NSP1 can induce degradation of
inactive and activated forms of IAD-containing IRF proteins (IRF3 to IRF9),
allowing a multipronged attack on IFN-based pathways that promote antiviral
innate and adaptive immune responses.

Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.

Induction of innate immunity is essential for host survival of infection. Evasion
and inhibition of innate immunity constitute a strategy used by pathogens, such
as the highly virulent bacterium Francisella tularensis, to ensure their
replication and transmission. The mechanism and bacterial components responsible 
for this suppression of innate immunity by F. tularensis are not defined. In this
article, we demonstrate that lipids enriched from virulent F. tularensis strain
SchuS4, but not attenuated live vaccine strain, inhibit inflammatory responses in
vitro and in vivo. Suppression of inflammatory responses is associated with
I<U+03BA>Ba-independent inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>Bp65 activation and selective inhibition of
activation of IFN regulatory factors. Interference with NF-<U+03BA>Bp65 and IFN
regulatory factors is also observed following infection with viable SchuS4.
Together these data provide novel insight into how highly virulent bacteria
selectively modulate the host to interfere with innate immune responses required 
for survival of infection.

IRF-1-binding site in the first intron mediates interferon-<U+03B3>-induced optineurin
promoter activation.

Optineurin is an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction, membrane
vesicle trafficking and autophagy. Optineurin expression is induced by cytokines.
Previously we have shown that tumor necrosis factor-a activates optineurin
promoter through NF-<U+03BA>B-binding site in the core promoter. However, this promoter 
was not activated by interferon-<U+03B3>. Here, we report identification of a functional
IRF-1-binding site in the first intron of human optineurin gene that mediates
interferon-<U+03B3>-induced activation of the promoter. Optineurin promoter, containing 
the contiguous intronic sequences with IRF-1 responsive sites, is strongly
activated by IRF-1. Mutational inactivation of IRF-1 site resulted in loss of
activation of the promoter by interferon-<U+03B3> and also by IRF-1. We also show that
IRF-1 cooperates with NF-<U+03BA>B to activate optineurin promoter. The synergistic
effect of these two transcription factors (IRF-1 and NF-<U+03BA>B) may be involved in
cooperative induction of optineurin promoter by interferon-<U+03B3> and tumor necrosis
factor-a.

BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence suggest a dichotomy between immune active
and quiescent cancers, with the former associated with a good prognostic
phenotype and better responsiveness to immunotherapy. Central to such dichotomy
is the master regulator of the acute inflammatory process interferon regulatory
factor (IRF)-1. However, it remains unknown whether the responsiveness of IRF-1
to cytokines is able to differentiate cancer immune phenotypes.
METHODS: IRF-1 activation was measured in 15 melanoma cell lines at basal level
and after treatment with IFN-<U+03B3>, TNF-a and a combination of both. Microarray
analysis was used to compare transcriptional patterns between cell lines
characterised by high or low IRF-1 activation.
RESULTS: We observed a strong positive correlation between IRF-1 activation at
basal level and after IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a treatment. Microarray demonstrated that
three cell lines with low and three with high IRF-1 inducible translocation
scores differed in the expression of 597 transcripts. Functional interpretation
analysis showed mTOR and Wnt/ß-cathenin as the top downregulated pathways in the 
cell lines with low inducible IRF-1 activation, suggesting that a low IRF-1
inducibility recapitulates a cancer phenotype already described in literature
characterised by poor prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the central role of IRF-1 in influencing
different tumour phenotypes.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 polymorphisms previously associated with reduced
HIV susceptibility have no effect on HIV disease progression.

INTRODUCTION: Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is induced by HIV early in
the infection process and serves two functions: transactivation of the HIV-1
genome and thus replication, and eliciting antiviral innate immune responses. We 
previously described three IRF1 polymorphisms that correlate with reduced IRF1
expression and reduced HIV susceptibility.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether IRF1 polymorphisms previously associated with
reduced HIV susceptibility play a role in HIV pathogenesis and disease
progression in HIV-infected ART-naïve individuals.
METHODS: IRF1 genotyping for polymorphisms (619, MS and 6516) was performed by
PCR in 847 HIV positive participants from a sex worker cohort in Nairobi, Kenya. 
Rates of CD4+ T cell decline and viral loads (VL) were analyzed using linear
mixed models.
RESULTS: Three polymorphisms in the IRF1, located at 619, microsatellite region
and 6516 of the gene, previously associated with decreased susceptibility to HIV 
infection show no effect on disease progression, either measured by HIV-1 RNA
levels or the slopes of CD4 decline before treatment initiation.
CONCLUSION: Whereas these three polymorphisms in the IRF1 gene protect against
HIV-1 acquisition, they appear to exert no discernable effects once infection is 
established.

Dysregulation of interferon regulatory factors impairs the expression of
immunostimulatory molecules in hepatitis C virus genotype 1-infected hepatocytes.

BACKGROUND: IL-7 and IL-15 are produced by hepatocytes and are critical for the
expansion and function of CD8 T cells. IL-15 needs to be presented by IL-15Ra for
efficient stimulation of CD8 T cells.
METHODS: We analysed the hepatic levels of IL-7, IL-15, IL-15Ra and interferon
regulatory factors (IRF) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (78% genotype
1) and the role of IRF1 and IRF2 on IL-7 and IL-15Ra expression in Huh7 cells
with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon.
RESULTS: Hepatic expression of both IL-7 and IL-15Ra, but not of IL-15, was
reduced in CHC. These patients exhibited decreased hepatic IRF2 messenger RNA
levels and diminished IRF2 staining in hepatocyte nuclei. We found that IRF2
controls basal expression of both IL-7 and IL-15Ra in Huh7 cells. IRF2, but not
IRF1, is downregulated in cells with HCV genotype 1b replicon and this was
accompanied by decreased expression of IL-7 and IL-15Ra, a defect reversed by
overexpressing IRF2. Treating Huh7 cells with IFNa plus oncostatin M increased
IL-7 and IL-15Ra mRNA more intensely than either cytokine alone. This effect was 
mediated by strong upregulation of IRF1 triggered by the combined treatment.
Induction of IRF1, IL-7 and IL-15Ra by IFNa plus oncostatin M was dampened in
replicon cells but the combination was more effective than either cytokine alone.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV genotype 1 infection downregulates IRF2 in hepatocytes
attenuating hepatocellular expression of IL-7 and IL-15Ra. Our data reveal a new 
mechanism by which HCV abrogates specific T-cell responses and point to a novel
therapeutic approach to stimulate anti-HCV immunity.

miR-23a targets interferon regulatory factor 1 and modulates cellular
proliferation and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinoma cells.

Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.

MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that function as key regulators of gene 
expression at the post-transcriptional level. In our previous research, we found 
that miR-23a was significantly up-regulated in human gastric adenocarcinoma
cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that miR-23a suppresses
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and promotes the cell proliferation and colony
formation ability of gastric adenocarcinoma cells. We have identified tumor
suppressor interferon regulator factor 1 (IRF1) as a direct target gene of
miR-23a. We performed a fluorescent reporter assay to confirm that miR-23a bound 
to the IRF1 mRNA 3'UTR directly and specifically. The ectopic expression of IRF1 
markedly promoted paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and inhibited cell viability and
colony formation ability, whereas the knockdown of IRF1 had the opposite effects.
The restoration of IRF1 expression counteracted the effects of miR-23a on the
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma
cells. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that miR-23a is frequently up-regulated 
in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, whereas IRF1 is down-regulated in cancer
tissues. Altogether, these results indicate that miR-23a suppresses
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and promotes cell viability and the colony formation
ability of gastric adenocarcinoma cells by targeting IRF1 at the
post-transcriptional level.

Distinct roles of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded viral
interferon regulatory factors in inflammatory response and cancer.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent associated 
with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric
Castleman disease (MCD). Similar to other herpesviruses, KSHV has two life
cycles, latency and lytic replication. In latency, the KSHV genome persists as a 
circular episome in the nucleus of the host cell and only a few viral genes are
expressed. In this review, we focus on oncogenic, antiapoptotic, and
immunomodulating properties of KSHV-encoded homologues of cellular interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs)--viral IRF1 (vIRF1) to vIRF4--and their possible role
in the KSHV-mediated antiviral response, apoptosis, and oncogenicity.

macrophages and their progenitors.

The development of macrophages is a highly regulated process requiring
coordination amongst transcription factors. The presence/absence, relative
levels, antagonism, or synergy of all transcription factors involved is critical 
to directing lineage cell fate and differentiation. While relative levels of many
key myeloid transcription factors have been determined in mammalian macrophage
differentiation, a similar set of studies have yet to be conducted in a teleost
system. In this study, we report on the mRNA levels of transcription factors
(cebpa, cjun, cmyb, egr1, gata1, gata2, gata3, lmo2, mafb, pax5, pu.1 and runx1) 
in sorted goldfish progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages from primary
kidney macrophage cultures. The mRNA levels of runx1 and pu.1 were significantly 
higher, gata3 and pax5 mRNA levels were lower, in monocytes compared to
progenitors, and the mRNA levels of cjun, egr1, gata2, gata3, mafb and pax5 were 
significantly decreased in macrophages compared to progenitor cells. The relative
mRNA levels of the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors, 
irf1, irf2, irf5, irf7, irf8 and irf9 in sorted progenitors, monocytes and
macrophages were also measured. In contrast to other irf family transcription
factors examined, irf8 mRNA levels were increased in monocytes compared to
progenitors by greater than three-fold, suggesting that irf8 is important for
monopoiesis. Lastly, we show the differential regulation of myeloid transcription
factor mRNA levels in sorted progenitor cells from 1, 2, or 3-day old cultures in
response to the recombinant goldfish growth factors, rgCSF-1 and rgKITLA.

Nucleofection of expression vectors induces a robust interferon response and
inhibition of cell proliferation.

Czech Republic.

The interferon (IFN) response, induced as a side effect after transfection of
nucleic acids into mammalian cells, is known but inadequately described. We
followed the IFN response, the fate of cells, and the possible mechanisms leading
to this response in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts after DNA nucleofection. The gateway
destination vector, phGf, and its derivatives encoding toxic and non-toxic
variants of the minor structural proteins of polyomaviruses, VP2 and VP3, were
used. DNA vector sequences induced in cells the production of high levels of IFN 
and the upregulation of the IFN-inducible genes, Mx-1, STAT1, IRF1, and IRF7. The
IFN response was not restricted to phGf-derived plasmids. In nucleofected cells, 
upregulation of the modified <U+03B3>-histone 2A.X indicating DNA damage and inhibition 
of cell proliferation were also observed. Although 3T3 cells expressed the
Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) and vectors used for nucleofection contained
unmethylated CpGs, signaling leading to IFN induction was found to be TLR9
independent. However, the early activation of nuclear factor-kappa B suggested
the participation of this transcription factor in IFN induction. Surprisingly, in
contrast to nucleofection, transfection using a cationic polymer induced only a
poor IFN response. Together, the results point to a strong side effect of
nucleofection.

Immune mediators regulate CFTR expression through a bifunctional airway-selective
enhancer.

Zhang Z(1), Leir SH, Harris A.

Author information: 
(1)Human Molecular Genetics Program, Lurie Children's Research Center, and
Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,
Chicago, Illinois, USA.

An airway-selective DNase-hypersensitive site (DHS) at kb -35 (DHS-35kb) 5' to
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is evident in
many lung cell lines and primary human tracheal epithelial cells but is absent
from intestinal epithelia. The DHS-35kb contains an element with enhancer
activity in 16HBE14o- airway epithelial cells and is enriched for monomethylated 
H3K4 histones (H3K4me1). We now define a 350-bp region within DHS-35kb which has 
full enhancer activity and binds interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and
nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) in vitro and in vivo. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated depletion of IRF1 or overexpression of IRF2, an antagonist of
IRF1, reduces CFTR expression in 16HBE14o- cells. NF-Y is critical for
maintenance of H3K4me1 enrichment at DHS-35kb since depletion of NF-YA, a subunit
of NF-Y, reduces H3K4me1 enrichment at this site. Moreover, depletion of SETD7,
an H3K4 monomethyltransferase, reduces both H3K4me1 and NF-Y occupancy,
suggesting a requirement of H3K4me1 for NF-Y binding. NF-Y depletion also
represses Sin3A and reduces its occupancy across the CFTR locus, which is
accompanied by an increase in p300 enrichment at multiple sites. Our results
reveal that the DHS-35kb airway-selective enhancer element plays a pivotal role
in regulation of CFTR expression by two independent regulatory mechanisms.

Reactive oxygen species and IRF1 stimulate IFNa production by proximal tubules
during ischemic AKI.

Richardson JA, Lu CY.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, Nephrology Division, University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

We previously reported that expression of the transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is an early, critical maladaptive signal expressed by 
renal tubules during murine ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). We now show that 
IRF1 mediates signals from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during
ischemic AKI and that these signals ultimately result in production of a-subtypes
of type I interferons (IFNas). We found that genetic knockout of the common type 
I IFN receptor (IFNARI-/-) improved kidney function and histology during AKI.
There are major differences in the spatial-temporal production of the two major
IFN subtypes, IFNß and IFNas: IFNß expression peaks at 4 h, earlier than IFNas,
and continues at the same level at 24 h; expression of IFNas also increases at 4 
h but continues to increase through 24 h. The magnitude of the increase in IFNas 
relative to baseline is much greater than that of IFNß. We show by
immunohistology and study of isolated cells that IFNß is produced by renal
leukocytes and IFNas are produced by renal tubules. IRF1, IFNas, and IFNARI were 
found on the same renal tubules during ischemic AKI. Furthermore, we found that
ROS induced IFNa expression by renal tubules in vitro. This expression was
inhibited by small interfering RNA knockdown of IRF1. Overexpression of IRF1
resulted in the production of IFNas. Furthermore, we found that IFNa stimulated
production of maladaptive proinflammatory CXCL2 by renal tubular cells.
Altogether our data support the following autocrine pathway in renal tubular
cells: ROS > IRF1 > IFNa > IFNARI > CXCL2.

The targeting and functions of miRNA-383 are mediated by FMRP during
spermatogenesis.

Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui
230026, China.

Our previous studies have shown that microRNA-383 (miR-383) expression is
downregulated in the testes of infertile men with maturation arrest (MA).
Abnormal testicular miR-383 expression may potentiate the connections between
male infertility and testicular germ cell tumors. However, the mechanisms
underlying the targeting and functions of miR-383 during spermatogenesis remain
unknown. In this study, we found that fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
was associated with 88 miRNAs in mouse testis including miR-383. Knockdown of
FMRP in NTERA-2 (NT2) (testicular embryonal carcinoma) cells enhanced
miR-383-induced suppression of cell proliferation by decreasing the interaction
between FMRP and miR-383, and then affecting miR-383 binding to the
3'-untranslated region of its target genes, including interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF1) and Cyclin D1 both in vivo and in vitro. On the other hand, FMRP 
levels were also downregulated by overexpression of miR-383 in NT2 cells and GC1 
(spermatogonia germ cell line). miR-383 targeted to Cyclin D1 directly, and then 
inhibited its downstream effectors, including phosphorylated pRb and E2F1, which 
ultimately resulted in decreased FMRP expression. Reduced miR-383 expression,
dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression (one of the downstream genes of
miR-383) and increased DNA damage were also observed in the testes of Fmr1
knockout mice and of MA patients with a downregulation of FMRP. A potential
feedback loop between FMRP and miR-383 during spermatogenesis is proposed, and
FMRP acts as a negative regulator of miR-383 functions. Our data also indicate
that dysregulation of the FMRP-miR-383 pathway may partially contribute to human 
spermatogenic failure with MA.

Endothelial TNF receptor 2 induces IRF1 transcription factor-dependent
interferon-ß autocrine signaling to promote monocyte recruitment.

Endothelial-dependent mechanisms of mononuclear cell influx are not well
understood. We showed that acute stimulation of murine microvascular endothelial 
cells expressing the tumor necrosis factor receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 with the
soluble cytokine TNF led to CXCR3 chemokine generation. The TNF receptors
signaled through interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) to induce interferon-ß
(IFN-ß) and subsequent autocrine signaling via the type I IFN receptor and the
transcription factor STAT1. Both TNFR2 and TNFR1 were required for IRF1-IFNß
signaling and, in human endothelial cells TNFR2 expression alone induced IFN-ß
signaling and monocyte recruitment. In vivo, TNFR1 was required for acute renal
neutrophil and monocyte influx after systemic TNF treatment, whereas the
TNFR2-IRF1-IFN-ß autocrine loop was essential only for macrophage accumulation.
In a chronic model of proliferative nephritis, IRF1 and renal-expressed TNFR2
were essential for sustained macrophage accumulation. Thus, our data identify a
pathway in endothelial cells that selectively recruits monocytes during a
TNF-induced inflammatory response.

pyhin1 on LPS-induced inflammatory response was examined. LPS augmented the
pyhin1 mRNA expression in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and peritoneal
macrophages. The augmentation of pyhin1 mRNA expression was abolished by
parthenolide, a NF-<U+03BA>B inhibitor. Silencing of pyhin1 with small interfering RNA
reduced the production of IFN-ß and NO. However, pyhin1 silencing did not affect 
the production of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and prostaglandin E2. Reduced IFN-ß
production by pyhin1 silencing caused inactivation of STAT1 and reduced
expression of IRF1. Pyhin1 silencing inhibited the expression of TRAF6, TBK1 and 
TRIF, which trigger IFN-ß production in the MyD88-independent pathway. However,
pyhin1 silencing did not affect the expression of MyD88, IRAK4 and several
mitogen-activated protein kinases in the MyD88-dependent pathway. Taken together,
mouse pyhin1 was suggested to be a NF-<U+03BA>B-responsible gene in response to LPS and 
positively regulate LPS-induced IFN-ß and NO production through up-regulating the
MyD88-independent signaling pathway.

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen in periodontal disease and is
associated with immune dysbiosis. In this study, we found that P. gingivalis did 
not induce the expression of the T-cell chemokine IP-10 (CXCL10) from
neutrophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or gingival epithelial
cells. Furthermore, P. gingivalis suppressed gamma interferon (IFN-<U+03B3>)-stimulated 
release of IP-10, ITAC (CXCL11), and Mig (CXCL9) from epithelial cells and
inhibited IP-10 secretion in a mixed infection with the otherwise stimulatory
Fusobacterium nucleatum. Inhibition of chemokine expression occurred at the level
of gene transcription and was associated with downregulation of interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and decreased levels of Stat1. Ectopic expression of 
IRF-1 in epithelial cells relieved P. gingivalis-induced inhibition of IP-10
release. Direct contact between P. gingivalis and epithelial cells was not
required for IP-10 inhibition. These results highlight the immune-disruptive
potential of P. gingivalis. Suppression of IP-10 and other Th1-biasing chemokines
by P. gingivalis may perturb the balance of protective and destructive immunity
in the periodontal tissues and facilitate the pathogenicity of oral microbial
communities.

Suppressor of cytokine signalling protein SOCS1 and UBP43 regulate the expression
of type I interferon-stimulated genes in human microvascular endothelial cells
infected with Rickettsia conorii.

Rickettsia conorii, the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever,
preferentially infects human microvascular endothelium and activates
pro-inflammatory innate immune responses as evidenced by enhanced expression and 
secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Our recent studies reveal that human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) infected with R. conorii also launch
'antiviral' host defence mechanisms typically governed by type I interferons. To 
summarize, infected HMECs secrete IFN-ß to activate STAT1 in an
autocrine/paracrine manner and display increased expression of IFN-stimulated
genes, for example ISG15, which in turn activate innate responses to interfere
with intracellular replication of rickettsiae. We now present evidence that UBP43
and SOCS1, known negative regulators of JAK/STAT signalling, are also induced in 
R. conorii-infected HMECs, of which UBP43 but not SOCS1 functions to negatively
regulate STAT1 activation. Interestingly, UBP43 induction is almost completely
abolished in the presence of IFN-ß-neutralizing antibody, implicating an
important role for UBP43 as a feedback inhibitor for IFN-ß-mediated STAT1
activation. In contrast, SOCS1 expression is only partially affected by IFN-ß
neutralization, implicating potential involvement of as-yet-unidentified
IFN-independent mechanism(s) in SOCS1 induction during R. conorii infection. A
number of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, MX1, IRF1, IRF9 and TAP1
are also induced in an IFN-ß-dependent manner, whereas GBP1 remains unaffected by
IFN-ß neutralization. Increased STAT1 phosphorylation in HMECs subjected to UBP43
knockdown led to transcriptional activation of OAS1, MX1 and GBP1, confirming the
negative regulatory role of UBP43. Although IRF1, IRF9 and TAP1 were induced by
IFN-ß, siRNA-mediated silencing of UBP43 or SOCS1 did not significantly affect
their transcriptional activation. Expression of ISG15 was, however, increased in 
HMECs transfected with siRNA for UBP43 and SOCS1. Thus, unique regulatory
patterns of induced expression of UBP43, SOCS1 and IFN-stimulated genes represent
pathogen-specific responses underlying IFN-ß-mediated host endothelial signalling
during the pathogenesis of spotted fever group rickettsiosis.

Up-regulation of intestinal epithelial cell derived IL-7 expression by
keratinocyte growth factor through STAT1/IRF-1, IRF-2 pathway.

Cai YJ(1), Wang WS, Yang Y, Sun LH, Teitelbaum DH, Yang H.

Author information:

University, Chongqing, China.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells(EC)-derived interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a crucial
role in control of development and homeostasis of neighboring intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IEL), and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) exerts protective effects
on intestinal epithelial cells and up-regulates EC-derived IL-7 expression
through KGFR pathway. This study was to further investigate the molecular
mechanism involved in the regulation of IL-7 expression by KGF in the intestine.
METHODS: Intestinal epithelial cells (LoVo cells) and adult C57BL/6J mice were
treated with KGF. Epithelial cell proliferation was studied by flow cytometry for
BrdU-incorporation and by immunohistochemistry for PCNA staining. Western blot
was used to detect the changes of expression of P-Tyr-STAT1, STAT1, and IL-7 by
inhibiting STAT1. Alterations of nuclear extracts and total proteins of IRF-1,
IRF-2 and IL-7 following IRF-1 and IRF-2 RNA interference with KGF treatment were
also measured with western blot. Moreover, IL-7 mRNA expressions were also
detected by Real-time PCR and IL-7 protein level in culture supernatants was
measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA).
RESULTS: KGF administration significantly increased LoVo cell proliferation and
also increased intestinal wet weight, villus height, crypt depth and crypt cell
proliferation in mice. KGF treatment led to increased levels of P-Tyr-STAT1, RAPA
and AG490 both blocked P-Tyr-STAT1 and IL-7 expression in LoVo cells. IRF-1 and
IRF-2 expression in vivo and in vitro were also up-regulated by KGF, and IL-7
expression was decreased after IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression was silenced by
interfering RNA, respectively.
CONCLUSION: KGF could up-regulate IL-7 expression through the STAT1/IRF-1, IRF-2 
signaling pathway, which is a new insight in potential effects of KGF on the
intestinal mucosal immune system.

BACKGROUND: The availability of gene expression data that corresponds to pig
immune response challenges provides compelling material for the understanding of 
the host immune system. Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and
expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of
independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In 
this study, we performed two meta-analyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i)
scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii)
determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome
Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to
PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the
common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways
specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was 
used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated
by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological
functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig
immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig
global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig
response to PRRSV infection, respectively.
RESULTS: The pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical 
pathways involved in the regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy
metabolism. Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred
around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post
transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation.
Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions,
associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors
such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially
involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to 
PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in
response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and
hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis
brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive
immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most
significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1,
which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other
transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and
IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals key genes, canonical pathways and biological
functions involved in the pig global immune response to diverse challenges,
including PRRSV infection. The powerful statistical approach led us to
consolidate previous findings as well as to gain new insights into the pig immune
response either to common stimuli or specifically to PRRSV infection.

Conditional deletion of Jak2 reveals an essential role in hematopoiesis
throughout mouse ontogeny: implications for Jak2 inhibition in humans.

Germline deletion of Jak2 in mice results in embryonic lethality at E12.5 due to 
impaired hematopoiesis. However, the role that Jak2 might play in late gestation 
and postnatal life is unknown. To understand this, we utilized a conditional
knockout approach that allowed for the deletion of Jak2 at various stages of
prenatal and postnatal life. Specifically, Jak2 was deleted beginning at either
mid/late gestation (E12.5), at postnatal day 4 (PN4), or at ~2 months of age.
Deletion of Jak2 beginning at E12.5 resulted in embryonic death characterized by 
a lack of hematopoiesis. Deletion beginning at PN4 was also lethal due to a lack 
of erythropoiesis. Deletion of Jak2 in young adults was characterized by blood
cytopenias, abnormal erythrocyte morphology, decreased marrow hematopoietic
potential, and splenic atrophy. However, death was observed in only 20% of the
mutants. Further analysis of these mice suggested that the increased
survivability was due to an incomplete deletion of Jak2 and subsequent
re-population of Jak2 expressing cells, as conditional deletion in mice having
one floxed Jak2 allele and one null allele resulted in a more severe phenotype
and subsequent death of all animals. We found that the deletion of Jak2 in the
young adults had a differential effect on hematopoietic lineages; specifically,
conditional Jak2 deletion in young adults severely impaired erythropoiesis and
thrombopoiesis, modestly affected granulopoiesis and monocytopoiesis, and had no 
effect on lymphopoiesis. Interestingly, while the hematopoietic organs of these
mutant animals were severely affected by the deletion of Jak2, we found that the 
hearts, kidneys, lungs, and brains of these same mice were histologically normal.
From this, we conclude that Jak2 plays an essential and non-redundant role in
hematopoiesis during both prenatal and postnatal life and this has direct
implications regarding the inhibition of Jak2 in humans.

The B-aggressive lymphoma-1 protein and ADP-ribosyltransferase BAL1/ARTD9 has
been recently identified as a risk-related gene product in aggressive diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). BAL1 is constitutively expressed in a subset of
high-risk DLBCLs with an active host inflammatory response and has been suggested
to be associated with interferon-related gene expression. Here we identify BAL1
as a novel oncogenic survival factor in DLBCL and show that constitutive
overexpression of BAL1 in DLBCL tightly associates with intrinsic
interferon-gamma (IFN<U+03B3>) signaling and constitutive activity of signal transducer 
and activator of transcription (STAT)-1. Remarkably, BAL1 stimulates the
phosphorylation of both STAT1 isoforms, STAT1a and STAT1ß, on Y701 and thereby
promotes the nuclear accumulation of the antagonistically acting and
transcriptionally repressive isoform STAT1ß. Moreover, BAL1 physically interacts 
with both STAT1a and STAT1ß through its macrodomains in an
ADP-ribosylation-dependent manner. BAL1 directly inhibits, together with STAT1ß, 
the expression of tumor suppressor and interferon response factor (IRF)-1.
Conversely, BAL1 enhances the expression of the proto-oncogenes IRF2 and B-cell
CLL/lymphoma (BCL)-6 in DLBCL. Our results show for the first time that BAL1
represses the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic IFN<U+03B3>-STAT1-IRF1-p53 axis and
mediates proliferation, survival and chemo-resistance in DLBCL. As a consequence 
constitutive IFN<U+03B3>-STAT1 signaling does not lead to apoptosis but rather to
chemo-resistance in DLBCL overexpressing BAL1. Our results suggest that BAL1 may 
induce an switch in STAT1 from a tumor suppressor to an oncogene in high-risk
DLBCL.

epithelial cells during Helicobacter pylori infection and exacerbates disease
severity.

Virulent Helicobacter pylori strains that specifically activate signaling in
epithelial cells via the innate immune molecule, nucleotide oligomerization
domain 1 (NOD1), are more frequently associated with IFN-<U+03B3>-dependent inflammation
and with severe clinical outcomes (i.e., gastric cancer and peptic ulceration).
In cell culture models, we showed that H. pylori activation of the NOD1 pathway
caused enhanced proinflammatory signaling in epithelial cells in response to
IFN-<U+03B3> stimulation through the direct effects of H. pylori on two components of
the IFN-<U+03B3> signaling pathway, STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1).
Specifically, H. pylori activation of the NOD1 pathway was shown to increase the 
levels of STAT1-Tyr(701)/Ser(727) phosphorylation and IRF1 expression/synthesis
in cells, resulting in enhanced production of the NOD1- and IFN-<U+03B3>-regulated
chemokines, IL-8- and IFN-<U+03B3>-induced protein 10, respectively. Consistent with the
notion that heightened proinflammatory signaling in epithelial cells may have an 
impact on disease severity, we observed significantly increased expression levels
of NOD1, CXCL8, IRF1, and CXCL10 in human gastric biopsies displaying severe
gastritis, when compared with those without gastritis (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p <
0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). Interestingly, NOD1, CXCL8, and IRF1
expression levels were also significantly upregulated in gastric tumor tissues,
when compared with paired nontumor samples (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05,
respectively). Thus, we propose that cross-talk between NOD1 and IFN-<U+03B3> signaling 
pathways contribute to H. pylori-induced inflammatory responses, potentially
revealing a novel mechanism whereby virulent H. pylori strains promote more
severe disease.

Reduction in ATP levels triggers immunoproteasome activation by the 11S (PA28)
regulator during early antiviral response mediated by IFNß in mouse pancreatic
ß-cells.

Autoimmune destruction of insulin producing pancreatic ß-cells is the hallmark of
type I diabetes. One of the key molecules implicated in the disease onset is the 
immunoproteasome, a protease with multiple proteolytic sites that collaborates
with the constitutive 19S and the inducible 11S (PA28) activators to produce
immunogenic peptides for presentation by MHC class I molecules. Despite its
importance, little is known about the function and regulation of the
immunoproteasome in pancreatic ß-cells. Of special interest to immunoproteasome
activation in ß-cells are the effects of IFNß, a type I IFN secreted by
virus-infected cells and implicated in type I diabetes onset, compared to IFN<U+03B3>,
the classic immunoproteasome inducer secreted by cells of the immune system. By
qPCR analysis, we show that mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells and mouse islets
accumulate the immune proteolytic ß1(i), ß2(i) and ß5(i), and 11S mRNAs upon
exposure to IFNß or IFN<U+03B3>. Higher concentrations of IFNß than IFN<U+03B3> are needed for 
similar expression, but in each case the expression is transient, with maximal
mRNA accumulation in 12 hours, and depends primarily on Interferon Regulatory
Factor 1. IFNs do not alter expression of regular proteasome genes, and in the
time frame of IFNß-mediated response, the immune and regular proteolytic subunits
co-exist in the 20S particles. In cell extracts with ATP, these particles have
normal peptidase activities and degrade polyubiquitinated proteins with rates
typical of the regular proteasome, implicating normal regulation by the 19S
activator. However, ATP depletion rapidly stimulates the catalytic rates in a
manner consistent with levels of the 11S activator. These findings suggest that
stochastic combination of regular and immune proteolytic subunits may increase
the probability with which unique immunogenic peptides are produced in pancreatic
ß-cells exposed to IFNß, but primarily in cells with reduced ATP levels that
stimulate the 11S participation in immunoproteasome function.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection alters macrophage gene expression and
macrophage response to IFN-<U+03B3>, a critical host defense cytokine. However,
regulation of these changes is poorly understood. We report discordance of
changes in nascent transcript and total nuclear RNA abundance for the
transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1, together with lack of effect on their RNA
half-lives, in human THP-1 cells infected with M. tuberculosis and stimulated
with IFN-<U+03B3>. The results indicate that negative postinitiation regulation of mRNA 
biogenesis limits the expression of these factors, which mediate host defense
against M. tuberculosis through the cellular response to IFN-<U+03B3>. Consistent with
the results for STAT1 and IRF1, transcriptome analysis reveals downregulation of 
postinitiation mRNA biogenesis processes and pathways by infection, with and
without IFN-<U+03B3> stimulation. Clinical relevance for regulation of postinitiation
mRNA biogenesis is demonstrated by studies of donor samples showing that
postinitiation mRNA biogenesis pathways are repressed in latent tuberculosis
infection compared with cured disease and in active tuberculosis compared with
ongoing treatment or with latent tuberculosis. For active disease and latent
infection donors from two populations (London, U.K., and The Gambia), each
analyzed using a different platform, pathway-related gene expression differences 
were highly correlated, demonstrating substantial specificity in the effect.
Collectively, the molecular and bioinformatic analyses point toward
downregulation of postinitiation mRNA biogenesis pathways as a means by which M. 
tuberculosis infection limits expression of immunologically essential
transcription factors. Thus, negative regulation of postinitiation mRNA
biogenesis can constrain the macrophage response to infection and overall host
defense against tuberculosis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed small non-coding RNAs that, in most
cases, negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
miRNAs are involved in fine-tuning fundamental cellular processes such as
proliferation, cell death and cell cycle control and are believed to confer
robustness to biological responses. Here, we investigated simultaneously the
transcriptional changes of miRNA and mRNA expression levels over time after
activation of the Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription
(Jak/STAT) pathway by interferon-<U+03B3> stimulation of melanoma cells. To examine
global miRNA and mRNA expression patterns, time-series microarray data were
analysed. We observed delayed responses of miRNAs (after 24-48 h) with respect to
mRNAs (12-24 h) and identified biological functions involved at each step of the 
cellular response. Inference of the upstream regulators allowed for
identification of transcriptional regulators involved in cellular reactions to
interferon-<U+03B3> stimulation. Linking expression profiles of transcriptional
regulators and miRNAs with their annotated functions, we demonstrate the dynamic 
interplay of miRNAs and upstream regulators with biological functions. Finally,
our data revealed network motifs in the form of feed-forward loops involving
transcriptional regulators, mRNAs and miRNAs. Additional information obtained
from integrating time-series mRNA and miRNA data may represent an important step 
towards understanding the regulatory principles of gene expression.

In inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial products induce the
production of high amounts of NO by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in
inflammatory and tissue cells. NO is an effector molecule in innate immunity, and
it also has regulatory and pro-inflammatory/destructive effects in the
inflammatory process. Protein kinase Cd (PKCd) is an important signaling protein 
regulating B lymphocyte functions, but less is known about its effects in innate 
immunity and inflammatory gene expression. In the present study we investigated
the role of PKCd in the regulation of iNOS expression in inflammatory conditions.
NO production and iNOS expression were induced by LPS or a combination of
cytokines IFN<U+03B3>, IL-1ß, and TNFa. Down-regulation of PKCd by siRNA and inhibition 
of PKCd by rottlerin suppressed NO production and iNOS expression in activated
macrophages and fibroblasts. PKCd directed siRNA and inhibition of PKCd by
rottlerin suppressed also the expression of transcription factor IRF1, possibly
through inhibition of STAT1 activation. Accordingly, down-regulation of IRF1 by
siRNA reduced iNOS expression in response to inflammatory stimuli. In addition,
inhibition of PKCd showed anti-inflammatory effects in carrageenan induced paw
inflammation in mice as did iNOS inhibitor L-NIL. These results suggest that
inhibitors of PKCd have anti-inflammatory effects in disease states complicated
by enhanced NO production through iNOS pathway.

molecules in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.

The functions of miR-9 in some cancers are recently implicated in regulating
proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis, 
apoptosis, and tumor angiogenesis, etc. miR-9 is commonly down-regulated in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the exact roles of miR-9 dysregulation in the
pathogenesis of NPC remains unclear. Therefore, we firstly used miR-9-expressing 
CNE2 cells to determine the effects of miR-9 overexpression on global gene
expression profile by microarray analysis. Microarray-based gene expression data 
unexpectedly demonstrated a significant number of up- or down-regulated immune-
and inflammation-related genes, including many well-known interferon
(IFN)-induced genes (e.g., IFI44L, PSMB8, IRF5, PSMB10, IFI27, PSB9_HUMAN, IFIT2,
TRAIL, IFIT1, PSB8_HUMAN, IRF1, B2M and GBP1), major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I molecules (e.g., HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-F and HLA-H) and interleukin
(IL)-related genes (e.g., IL20RB, GALT, IL7, IL1B, IL11, IL1F8, IL1A, IL6 and
IL7R), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-9 with
the miRNA mimics significantly up- or down-regulated the expression of
above-mentioned IFN-inducible genes, MHC class I molecules and IL-related genes; 
on the contrary, miR-9 inhibition by anti-miR-9 inhibitor in CNE2 and 5-8F cells 
correspondingly decreased or increased the aforementioned immune- and
inflammation-related genes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate, for the

class I molecules in human cancer cells, suggesting a novel role of miR-9 in
linking inflammation and cancer, which remains to be fully characterized.

IRF1 is a transcription factor involved in interferon signaling and has been
shown to harbor tumor suppressor activity. In order to comprehensively identify
pathways regulated by IRF1, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
massive-parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to evaluate the gene targets of IRF1
genome-wide. We identified 17,416 total binding events in breast cancer cells.
Functional categorization of the binding sites after IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma)
treatment determined that 'apoptosis' or 'cell death' is the most enriched target
process. Motif discovery analysis of the chromosomal regions bound by IRF1
identified a number of unique motifs correlated with apoptosis, DNA damage and
immune processes. Analysis of GEO transcriptome data from IRF1-transduced cells
or IFN-gamma treated fibroblasts indicates that IRF1-bound targets in IFN-treated
cells are associated with a positive transcriptional response. Many of the
enriched target genes from the expression analysis are associated with apoptosis.
Importantly, this data indicates that a significant function of IRF1 is the
regulation of anti-cancer apoptotic pathways and this reinforces IRF1's role as a
tumor suppressor.

Lyssavirus infection.

NF-<U+03BA>B transcription factors are crucial for many cellular processes. NF-<U+03BA>B is
activated by viral infections to induce expression of antiviral cytokines. Here, 
we identified a novel member of the human NF-<U+03BA>B family, denoted RelAp43, the
nucleotide sequence of which contains several exons as well as an intron of the
RelA gene. RelAp43 is expressed in all cell lines and tissues tested and exhibits
all the properties of a NF-<U+03BA>B protein. Although its sequence does not include a
transactivation domain, identifying it as a class I member of the NF-<U+03BA>B family,
it is able to potentiate RelA-mediated transactivation and stabilize dimers
comprising p50. Furthermore, RelAp43 stimulates the expression of HIAP1, IRF1,
and IFN-ß - three genes involved in cell immunity against viral infection. It is 
also targeted by the matrix protein of lyssaviruses, the agents of rabies,
resulting in an inhibition of the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway. Taken together, our data provide
the description of a novel functional member of the NF-<U+03BA>B family, which plays a
key role in the induction of anti-viral innate immune response.

Smad7 protein induces interferon regulatory factor 1-dependent transcriptional
activation of caspase 8 to restore tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis.

Smad7 has been known as a negative regulator for the transforming growth factor-ß
(TGF-ß) signaling pathway through feedback regulation. However, Smad7 has been
suspected to have other biological roles through the regulation of gene
transcription. By screening differentially regulated genes, we found that the
caspase 8 gene was highly up-regulated in Smad7-expressing cells. Smad7 was able 
to activate the caspase 8 promoter through recruitment of the interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) transcription factor to the interferon-stimulated
response element (ISRE) site. Interaction of Smad7 on the caspase 8 promoter was 
confirmed with electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiment. Interestingly, Smad7 did not directly interact
with the ISRE site, but it increased the binding activity of IRF1 with ISRE.
These results support that Smad7 recruits IRF1 protein on the caspase 8 promoter 
and functions as a transcriptional coactivator. To confirm the biological
significance of caspase 8 up-regulation, we tested tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated cell death assay in
breast cancer cells. Smad7 in apoptosis-resistant MCF7 cells markedly sensitized 
the cells to TRAIL-induced cell death by restoring the caspase cascade.
Furthermore, restoration of caspase 8-mediated apoptosis pathway repressed the
tumor growth in the xenograft model. In conclusion, we suggest a novel role for
Smad7 as a transcriptional coactivator for caspase 8 through the interaction with
IRF1 in regulation of the cell death pathway.

Toxoplasma gondii clonal strains all inhibit STAT1 transcriptional activity but
polymorphic effectors differentially modulate IFN<U+03B3> induced gene expression and
STAT1 phosphorylation.

Massachusetts, United States of America.

Host defense against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires the cytokine
interferon-gamma (IFN<U+03B3>). However, Toxoplasma inhibits the host cell
transcriptional response to IFN<U+03B3>, which is thought to allow the parasite to
establish a chronic infection. It is not known whether all strains of Toxoplasma 
block IFN<U+03B3>-responsive transcription equally and whether this inhibition occurs
solely through the modulation of STAT1 activity or whether other transcription
factors are involved. We find that strains from three North American/European
clonal lineages of Toxoplasma, types I, II, and III, can differentially modulate 
specific aspects of IFN<U+03B3> signaling through the polymorphic effector proteins
ROP16 and GRA15. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is activated in the absence of
IFN<U+03B3> by the Toxoplasma kinase ROP16, but this ROP16-activated STAT1 is not
transcriptionally active. Many genes induced by STAT1 can also be controlled by
other transcription factors and therefore using these genes as specific readouts 
to determine Toxoplasma inhibition of STAT1 activity might be inappropriate.
Indeed, GRA15 and ROP16 modulate the expression of subsets of IFN<U+03B3> responsive
genes through activation of the NF-<U+03BA>B/IRF1 and STAT3/6 transcription factors,
respectively. However, using a stable STAT1-specific reporter cell line we show
that strains from the type I, II, and III clonal lineages equally inhibit STAT1
transcriptional activity. Furthermore, all three of the clonal lineages
significantly inhibit global IFN<U+03B3> induced gene expression.

Interferon-<U+03B3> upregulates expression of IFP35 gene in HeLa cells via interferon
regulatory factor-1.

Education and Key Laboratory of Microbial Functional Genomics Tianjin, College of
Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.

BACKGROUND: Interferon-induced 35-kDa protein (IFP35) plays important roles in
antiviral defense and the progression of some skin cancer diseases. It can be
induced by interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) in multiple human cells. However, the mechanisms 
by which IFN-<U+03B3> contributes to IFP35 induction remain to be elucidated.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified the transcription start sites of IFP35 
by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and cloned the promoter of IFP35.
Sequence analysis and luciferase assays revealed two GC boxes and an
IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the 5' upstream region of the
transcription start sites, which were important for the basal transcription of
IFP35 gene. Furthermore, we found that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and
IRF-2 could bind to IFP35 promoter and upregulate endogenous IFP35 protein level.
Depletion of endogenous IRF-1 by interfering RNA reduced the constitutive and
IFN-<U+03B3>-dependent expression of IFP35, whereas depletion of IRF-2 had little effect
on IFN-<U+03B3>-inducible IFP35 expression. Moreover, IRF-1 was recruited to the ISRE
site in IFP35 promoter in IFN-<U+03B3> treated HeLa cells, as demonstrated by
electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide the first evidence that IRF-1
and IRF-2 are involved in constitutive IFP35 expression in HeLa cells, while
IRF-1 also activates IFP35 expression in an IFN-<U+03B3>-inducible manner. Our data
therefore identified a new IRF-1 and IRF-2 target gene, which may expand our
current understanding of the versatile functions of IRF-1 and IRF-2.

Heredity and cardiometabolic risk: naturally occurring polymorphisms in the human
neuropeptide Y(2) receptor promoter disrupt multiple transcriptional response
motifs.

OBJECTIVES: The neuropeptide Y(2) G-protein-coupled receptor (NPY2R) relays
signals from PYY or neuropeptide Y toward satiety and control of body mass.
Targeted ablation of the NPY2R locus in mice yields obesity, and studies of NPY2R
promoter genetic variation in more than 10,000 human participants indicate its
involvement in control of obesity and BMI. Here we searched for genetic variation
across the human NPY2R locus and probed its functional effects, especially in the
proximal promoter.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twin pair studies indicated substantial heritability for
multiple cardiometabolic traits, including BMI, SBP, DBP, and PYY, an endogenous 
agonist at NPY2R. Systematic polymorphism discovery by resequencing across NPY2R 
uncovered 21 genetic variants, 10 of which were common [minor allele frequency
(MAF) >5%], creating one to two linkage disequilibrium blocks in multiple
biogeographic ancestries. In vivo, NPY2R haplotypes were associated with both BMI
(P<U+200A>=<U+200A>3.75E-04) and PYY (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.01E-06). Computational approaches revealed that
proximal promoter variants G-1606A, C-599T, and A-224G disrupt predicted IRF1
(A>G), FOXI1 (T>C), and SNAI1 (A>G) response elements. In neuroendocrine cells
transfected with NPY2R promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids, all three variants 
and their resulting haplotypes influenced transcription (G-1606A, P<U+200A><<U+200A>2.97E-06;
C-599T, P<U+200A><<U+200A>1.17E-06; A-224G, P<U+200A><<U+200A>2.04E-06), and transcription was differentially
augmented or impaired by coexpression of either the cognate full-length
transcription factors or their specific siRNAs at each site. Endogenous
expression of transcripts for NPY2R, IRF1, and SNAI1 was documented in
neuroendocrine cells, and the NPY2R mRNA was differentially expressed in two
neuroendocrine tissues (adrenal gland, brainstem) of a rodent model of
hypertension and the metabolic syndrome, the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that common genetic variation in the proximal NPY2R
promoter influences transcription factor binding so as to alter gene expression
in neuroendocrine cells, and consequently cardiometabolic traits in humans. These
results unveil a novel control point, whereby cis-acting genetic variation
contributes to control of complex cardiometabolic traits, and point to new
transcriptional strategies for intervention into neuropeptide actions and their
cardiometabolic consequences.

Understanding the determinants for site-specific ubiquitination by E3 ligase
components of the ubiquitin machinery is proving to be a challenge. In the
present study we investigate the role of an E3 ligase docking site (Mf2 domain)
in an intrinsically disordered domain of IRF-1 [IFN (interferon) regulatory
factor-1], a short-lived IFN<U+03B3>-regulated transcription factor, in ubiquitination
of the protein. Ubiquitin modification of full-length IRF-1 by E3 ligases such as
CHIP [C-terminus of the Hsc (heat-shock cognate) 70-interacting protein] and MDM2
(murine double minute 2), which dock to the Mf2 domain, was specific for lysine
residues found predominantly in loop structures that extend from the DNA-binding 
domain, whereas no modification was detected in the more conformationally
flexible C-terminal half of the protein. The E3 docking site was not available
when IRF-1 was in its DNA-bound conformation and cognate DNA-binding sequences
strongly suppressed ubiquitination, highlighting a strict relationship between
ligase binding and site-specific modification at residues in the DNA-binding
domain. Hyperubiquitination of a non-DNA-binding mutant supports a mechanism
where an active DNA-bound pool of IRF-1 is protected from polyubiquitination and 
degradation.

FOXO1 Up-Regulates Human L-selectin Expression Through Binding to a Consensus
FOXO1 Motif.

L-selectin plays important roles in lymphocyte homing and leukocyte rolling.
Mounting evidence shows that it is involved in many disease entities including
diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion injuries, inflammatory diseases, and tumor
metastasis. Regulation of L-selectin at protein level has been well
characterized. However, the regulation of human L-selectin transcription remains 
largely unknown. To address transcriptional regulation of L-selectin, we cloned
1088 bp 5' of the start codon ATG. Luciferase analysis of the serial 5' deletion 
mutants located the core promoter region at -288/-1. A major transcription
initiation site was mapped at -115 by 5'RACE. Transcription factors Sp1, Ets1,
Mzf1, Klf2, and Irf1 bind to and transactivate the L-selectin promoter.
Significantly, FOXO1 binds to a FOXO1 motif, CCCTTTGG, at -87/-80, and
transactivates the L-selectin promoter in a dose-dependent manner.
Over-expression of a constitutive-active FOXO1 increased the endogenous
L-selectin expression in Jurkat cells. We conclude that FOXO1 regulates
L-selectin expression through targeting its promoter.

OBJECTIVE: Orthodontic treatment is usually associated with the application of
forces to teeth and periodontium. Instrumental in transmitting these forces are
the cells of the periodontal ligament (PDL). In the present study, we used an
established strain model to investigate the potential role of biophysical
stimulation in modulating the gene expression pattern of these PDL cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PDL cells derived from non-carious and periodontally
healthy teeth of six patients were grown on culture plates coated with collagen
type I. Upon completion of culture, dynamic strain was applied to the cells for
24 h, using 3% of tensile force and a frequency of 0.05 Hz. This loading protocol
for biomechanical stimulation was followed by extracting the RNA from the cells
and using a RT(2) PCR array(®) for analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to non-stimulated control cells, this analysis revealed the
induction of several factors (e.g., RELA, IRF1, MAX, MYC, CDKN1B, BCL2, BCL2A1)
known to influence tissue homeostasis by contributing essentially to cell
proliferation, cell differentiation, and the inhibition of apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the biomechanical stimulation of PDL
cells is an important factor in periodontal tissue homeostasis.

Transcriptome characterization of immune suppression from battlefield-like
stress.

Research, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5010, USA.

Transcriptome alterations of leukocytes from soldiers who underwent 8 weeks of
Army Ranger training (RASP, Ranger Assessment and Selection Program) were
analyzed to evaluate impacts of battlefield-like stress on the immune response.
About 1400 transcripts were differentially expressed between pre- and post-RASP
leukocytes. Upon functional analysis, immune response was the most enriched
biological process, and most of the transcripts associated with the immune
response were downregulated. Microbial pattern recognition, chemotaxis, antigen
presentation and T-cell activation were among the most downregulated immune
processes. Transcription factors predicted to be stress-inhibited (IRF7, RELA,
NF<U+03BA>B1, CREB1, IRF1 and HMGB) regulated genes involved in inflammation, maturation
of dendritic cells and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Many altered
transcripts were predicted to be targets of stress-regulated microRNAs. Post-RASP
leukocytes exposed ex vivo to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B showed a markedly
impaired immune response to this superantigen compared with pre-RASP leukocytes, 
consistent with the suppression of the immune response revealed by transcriptome 
analyses. Our results suggest that suppression of antigen presentation and
lymphocyte activation pathways, in the setting of normal blood cell counts, most 
likely contribute to the poor vaccine response, impaired wound healing and
infection susceptibility associated with chronic intense stress.

Poly-ICLC preconditioning protects the blood-brain barrier against ischemic
injury in vitro through type I interferon signaling.

Preconditioning with a low dose of harmful stimulus prior to injury induces
tolerance to a subsequent ischemic challenge resulting in neuroprotection against
stroke. Experimental models of preconditioning primarily focus on neurons as the 
cellular target of cerebral protection, while less attention has been paid to the
cerebrovascular compartment, whose role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain
injury is crucial. We have shown that preconditioning with polyinosinic
polycytidylic acid (poly-ICLC) protects against cerebral ischemic damage. To
delineate the mechanism of poly-ICLC protection, we investigated whether
poly-ICLC preconditioning preserves the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
in response to ischemic injury. Using an in vitro BBB model, we found that
poly-ICLC treatment prior to exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation maintained
the paracellular and transcellular transport across the endothelium and
attenuated the drop in transendothelial electric resistance. We found that
poly-ICLC treatment induced interferon (IFN) ß mRNA expression in astrocytes and 
microglia and that type I IFN signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells 
was required for protection. Importantly, this implicates a potential mechanism
underlying neuroprotection in our in vivo experimental stroke model, where type I
IFN signaling is required for poly-ICLC-induced neuroprotection against ischemic 
injury. In conclusion, we are the first to show that preconditioning with
poly-ICLC attenuates ischemia-induced BBB dysfunction. This mechanism is likely
an important feature of poly-ICLC-mediated neuroprotection and highlights the
therapeutic potential of targeting BBB signaling pathways to protect the brain
against stroke.

IRF-1 expression is induced by cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells and limits drug 
effectiveness.

Author information:

Turin, Italy.

BACKGROUND: The Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) are transcription factors
involved in immune responses and oncogenesis and most of them are classified as
tumour suppressors. The expression and activation of IRF(s) are stimulated by
several cytokines and by DNA damage. Here we examine the role of the IRF-1 in the
response of ovarian cancer cells to the front-line chemotherapeutic drug
cisplatin (CDDP).
METHODS: We evaluated the transcriptional response of three ovarian cancer cell
lines to CDDP both under control conditions and after IRF-1 silencing using
expression microarrays. The role played by IRF-1 in the response of these cells
to CDDP was evaluated after silencing and overexpressing IRF-1. We studied cell
cycle progression, colony forming ability in monolayer culture and semisolid
medium, and apoptosis in the response to the drug.
RESULTS: The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with CDDP boosted the expression
and the nuclear translocation of IRF-1, which in turn modulated the expression of
putative IRF-1 target genes. Accordingly, IRF-1 silencing re-orchestrated the
expression profiles of CDDP-treated cells. In agreement with its role as a tumour
suppressor, overexpressing IRF-1 suppressed the transformed phenotype of ovarian 
cancer cells. Nevertheless, IRF-1 silencing sensitized cells to the apoptotic
death induced by CDDP. Over-expression was associated with cell G1 arrest and p21
induction irrespective of p53 proficiency, while IRF-1 silencing reduced the
induction of p21 by CDDP.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that IRF-1 is up-regulated by CDDP in ovarian
cancer cells and might limit the cell response to CDDP, likely by inhibiting cell
proliferation. Data suggest that IRF-1 induction might interfere with the
effectiveness of combination therapy with platinum drugs and cytokines.

vascular endothelial cells.

Flavopiridol (FP), a synthetic flavone, is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
and possesses an anti-cancer activity. The effect of FP on interferon
(IFN)-<U+03B3>-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse vascular endothelial cell
line END-D was examined. FP significantly inhibited IFN-<U+03B3>-induced NO production
in END-D cells via reduced expression of an inducible NO synthase. FP inhibited
the activation of STAT1, and subsequently IRF1 as a downstream molecule of STAT1,
which is essential for IFN-<U+03B3>-induced NO production. FP did not affect the cell
surface expression of IFN-<U+03B3> receptor. Taken together, FP was suggested to inhibit
IFN-<U+03B3>-induced NO production in vascular endothelial cells via preventing
intracellular IFN-<U+03B3> signaling. FP might be useful as an immunomodulatory drug as 
well as an anti-cancer drug.

Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common solid extracranial cancer of childhood,
displays a remarkable low expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex class I 
(MHC-I) and Antigen Processing Machinery (APM) molecules, including Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER) Aminopeptidases, and poorly presents tumor antigens to Cytotoxic T
Lymphocytes (CTL). We have previously shown that this is due to low expression of
the transcription factor NF-kB p65. Herein, we show that not only NF-kB p65, but 
also the Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1) and certain APM components are low
in a subset of NB cell lines with aggressive features. Whereas single
transfection with either IRF1, or NF-kB p65 is ineffective, co-transfection
results in strong synergy and substantial reversion of the MHC-I/APM-low
phenotype in all NB cell lines tested. Accordingly, linked immunohistochemistry
expression patterns between nuclear IRF1 and p65 on the one hand, and MHC-I on
the other hand, were observed in vivo. Absence and presence of the three
molecules neatly segregated between high-grade and low-grade NB, respectively.
Finally, APM reconstitution by double IRF1/p65 transfection rendered a NB cell
line susceptible to killing by anti MAGE-A3 CTLs, lytic efficiency comparable to 
those seen upon IFN-<U+03B3> treatment. This is the first demonstration that a complex
immune escape phenotype can be rescued by reconstitution of a limited number of
master regulatory genes. These findings provide molecular insight into defective 
MHC-I expression in NB cells and provide the rational for T cell-based
immunotherapy in NB variants refractory to conventional therapy.

Prior studies showed that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway genes were
upregulated in the liver of rats fed ethanol, but not in rats fed ethanol plus
S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). These results were obtained using a PCR microplate
array analysis for TLRs and associated proteins such as proinflammatory cytokines
and chemokine mRNA levels. A large number of genes were upregulated by the
ethanol diet, but not the ethanol plus SAMe diet. In the present study, using the
same experimental rat livers, DNA methylation analysis was done by using an
Epitect Methyl DNA Restriction Kit (Qiagen, 335451) (24 genes). The results of
all the genes combined show a highly significant increase in methylation in the
ethanol-fed group of rats, but not in the dextrose-fed, SAMe-fed or ethanol plus 
SAMe-fed groups of rats. There was also an increase in DNA methylation in rats
with high blood alcohol levels compared to a rat with a low blood alcohol level. 
The individual genes that were upregulated as indicated by the increased mRNA
measured by qPCR correlated positively with the increased methylation of the DNA 
of the corresponding genes as follows: Cd14, Hspa1a, Irf1, Irak1, Irak2, Map3k7, 
Myd88, Ppara, Ripk2, Tollip and Traf6.

BACKGROUND: S. aureus is one of the main pathogens responsible for the
intra-mammary infection in dairy ruminants. Although much work has been carried
out to understand the complex physiological and cellular events that occur in the
mammary gland in response to S. aureus, the protective mechanisms are still
poorly understood. The objectives of the present study were to investigate gene
expression during the early response of the goat mammary gland to an experimental
challenge with S. aureus, in order to better understand the local and systemic
response and to compare them in two divergent lines of goat selected for high and
low milk somatic cell scores.
RESULTS: No differences in gene expression were found between high and low SCS
(Somatic Cells Score) selection lines. Analysing the two groups together, an
expression of 300 genes were found to change from T0 before infection, and T4 at 
24 hours and T5 at 30 hours following challenge. In blood derived white blood
cells 8 genes showed increased expression between T0 and T5 and 1 gene has
reduced expression. The genes showing the greatest increase in expression
following challenge (5.65 to 3.16 fold change) play an important role in (i)
immune and inflammatory response (NFKB1, TNFAIP6, BASP1, IRF1, PLEK, BATF3); (ii)
the regulation of innate resistance to pathogens (PTX3); and (iii) the regulation
of cell metabolism (CYTH4, SLC2A6, ARG2). The genes with reduced expression (-1.5
to -2.5 fold) included genes involved in (i) lipid metabolism (ABCG2, FASN), (ii)
chemokine, cytokine and intracellular signalling (SPPI), and (iii) cell
cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (KRT19).
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of genes with differential expression following infection
showed an inverse relationship between immune response and lipid metabolism in
the early response of the mammary gland to the S. aureus challenge. PTX3 showed a
large change in expression in both milk and blood, and is therefore a candidate
for further studies on immune response associated with mastitis.

BACKGROUND: Investigational approaches based on genome-wide association studies
have proven useful in identifying genetic predictors for many diseases, including
susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B and C. In these studies, the majority of
genetic variants that have shown a positive association have been identified in
genes involved in the immune response. In this study IFN-<U+03B3>, IFNGR-1, and IRF-1
genes were analyzed for their role in susceptibility to the development of
chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C in a Turkish population.
METHODS: Polymorphic genes IRF-1 (-410, -388), IFNGR-1 (-56, -611), and IFN-<U+03B3>
(+874) were analyzed in a total of 400 individuals: 100 chronic hepatitis B
patients, 100 hepatitis B carriers, 100 chronic hepatitis C patients, and 100
healthy controls. A single base primer extension assay was used. Correlations
between genes and gender, viral load, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were also investigated.
RESULTS: The IRF-1 gene at positions -388 and -410 were observed to be candidate 
gene markers for susceptibility to the development of chronic hepatitis B and C
(p<0.05). IFN-<U+03B3> +874 and IFNGR-1 (-56 and -611) correlated with chronic hepatitis
B but not chronic hepatitis C. Correlation of functional genotype with viral load
and AST and ALT levels revealed an association of IFN-<U+03B3> +874 and IFNGR-1 -611
with chronic hepatitis C and IFN-<U+03B3> +874 with viral load and chronic hepatitis B
(p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that IFN-<U+03B3> (+874), IRF-1 (-410, -388), and IFNGR-1 
(-56, -611) are candidate gene markers for determining patient susceptibility to 
the development of chronic hepatitis B and C.

Interleukin 27 induces the expression of complement factor H (CFH) in the retina.

Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Complement factor H (CFH) is a central regulator of the complement system and has
been implicated in the etiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a
leading cause of blindness in the elderly. In view of previous studies showing
that reduced expression of CFH in the retina is a risk factor for developing AMD,
there is significant interest in understanding how CFH expression is regulated in
the retina. In this study, we have shown that the anti-inflammatory cytokine,
IL-27, induced CFH expression in mouse retinal cells and human retinal pigmented 
epithelial cells (RPE) through STAT1-mediated up-regulation of Interferon
Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-8. We further show that cells in the ganglion
and inner-nuclear layers of the retina constitutively express IRF-1 and IRF-8 and
enhanced CFH expression in the retina during ocular inflammation correlated with 
significant increase in the expression of IRF-1, IRF-8 and IL-27 (IL-27p28 and
Ebi3). Our data thus reveal a novel role of IL-27 in regulating complement
activation through up-regulation of CFH and suggest that defects in IL-27
signaling or expression may contribute to the reduction of CFH expression in the 
retina of patients with AMD.

BACKGROUND: Recently, attenuation of anti-inflammatory and increase of
pro-inflammatory mediators was demonstrated in individuals with Down syndrome
(DS) in comparison with euploid patients during periodontal disease (PD),
suggesting a shift to a more aggressive inflammation in DS.
AIM: To determine the influence of DS in the modulation of interferons (IFNs)
signaling pathway in PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical periodontal assessment was performed and gingival
tissue samples obtained from a total of 51 subjects, including 19 DS individuals 
with PD, 20 euploid individuals with PD and 12 euploid individuals without PD.
Expression levels of interferon-gamma (IFNG) and interferon-alpha (IFNA), and
their receptors IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the signaling intermediates
Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) were determined using real time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
RESULTS: Clinical signs of periodontal disease were markedly more severe in DS
and euploid patients with PD in comparison to euploid and periodontally healthy
patients. There was no difference on mRNA levels of IFNA, IFNG, INFGR2, IFNAR1
and IFNAR2 between DS and euploid individuals, even though some of these genes
are located on chromosome 21. STAT1 and IRF1 mRNA levels were significantly lower
in DS patients in comparison with euploid individuals with PD. In euploid
individuals, PD was associated with an increased expression of IFNGR1, IFNGR2,
IFNAR1, STAT1 and IRF1.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced expression of STAT1 and IRF1 genes indicate an impaired
activation of IFNs signaling in individuals with DS and PD. Expression of IFNA,
IFNG and IFN receptors was not altered in DS patients, indicating that indirect
mechanisms are involved in the reduced activation of IFN signaling.

Staphylococcus aureus induces type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells via TLR9.

Parker D(1), Prince A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

The importance of type I IFN signaling in the innate immune response to viral and
intracellular pathogens is well established, with an increasing literature
implicating extracellular bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus,
in this signaling pathway. Airway epithelial cells and especially dendritic cells
(DCs) contribute to the production of type I IFNs in the lung. We were interested
in establishing how S. aureus activates the type I IFN cascade in DCs. In vitro
studies confirmed the rapid uptake of S. aureus by DCs followed promptly by STAT1
phosphorylation and expression of IFN-ß. Signaling occurred using heat-killed
organisms and in the absence of PVL and a-toxin. Consistent with the
participation of endosomal and not cytosolic receptors, signaling was
predominantly mediated by MyD88, TLR9, and IRF1 and blocked by cytochalasin D,
dynasore, and chloroquine. To determine the role of TLR9 signaling in the
pathogenesis of S. aureus pneumonia, we infected WT and Tlr9(-/-) mice with MRSA 
USA300. Tlr9(-/-) mice had significantly improved clearance of S. aureus from the
airways and lung tissue. Ifnar(-/-) mice also had improved clearance. This
enhanced clearance in Tlr9(-/-) mice was not due to differences in the numbers of
recruited neutrophils into the airways, but instead correlated with decreased
induction of TNF. Thus, we identified TLR9 as the critical receptor mediating the
induction of type I IFN signaling in DCs in response to S. aureus, illustrating
an additional mechanism through which S. aureus exploits innate immune signaling 
to facilitate infection.

Early life stage mortality is one of the problems faced by Atlantic cod
aquaculture. However, our understanding of immunity in early life stage fish is
still incomplete, and the information available is restricted to a few species.
In the present work we investigated the expression of immune-relevant transcripts
in Atlantic cod during early development. The transcripts subjected to QPCR
analysis in the present study were previously identified as putative anti-viral
or anti-bacterial genes in Atlantic cod using suppression subtractive
hybridization (SSH) libraries, QPCR, and/or microarrays. Of the 11 genes involved
in this study, only atf3, cxc chemokine and gaduscidin-1 were not detected at the
transcript level in all developmental stages investigated from unfertilized egg
to early larval stage. Adam22, hamp, il8, irf1, irf7, lgp2, sacsin, and stat1
transcripts were detected in unfertilized egg and 7h post-fertilization (~2-cell 
stage) embryos, showing maternal contribution of these immune-relevant
transcripts to the early embryonic transcriptome. The Atlantic cod genes included
in this study presented diverse transcript expression profiles throughout
embryonic and early larval development. For example, adam22 and sacsin
transcripts rose abruptly during blastula/gastrula stage and were then expressed 
at relatively high levels through subsequent embryonic and early larval
developmental stages. A peak in irf1 and irf7 transcript expression during early 
segmentation suggests that these interferon pathway genes play developmental
stage-specific roles during cod embryogenesis. Stat1 had increasing transcript
expression throughout blastula/gastrula, segmentation, and early larval
developmental stages. Atf3, cxc chemokine, gaduscidin-1, and il8 transcripts rose
approximately 2-3 fold during hatching, supporting the hypothesis that there is
preparation at the immune-relevant transcript expression level to deal with
environmental pathogens that may be encountered during early larval development. 
The specific roles that interferon pathway and other immune-relevant genes play
in early life stage cod, and the potential impact of their dynamic transcript
expression on immune competence of Atlantic cod embryos and larvae, remain
unclear and warrant further study.

IFN<U+03B3> inhibits the cytosolic replication of Shigella flexneri via the cytoplasmic 
RNA sensor RIG-I.

Jehl SP(1), Nogueira CV, Zhang X, Starnbach MN.

Massachusetts, United States of America.

The activation of host cells by interferon gamma (IFN<U+03B3>) is essential for
inhibiting the intracellular replication of most microbial pathogens. Although
significant advances have been made in identifying IFN<U+03B3>-dependent host factors
that suppress intracellular bacteria, little is known about how IFN<U+03B3> enables
cells to recognize, or restrict, the growth of pathogens that replicate in the
host cytoplasm. The replication of the cytosolic bacterial pathogen Shigella
flexneri is significantly inhibited in IFN<U+03B3>-stimulated cells, however the
specific mechanisms that mediate this inhibition have remained elusive. We found 
that S. flexneri efficiently invades IFN<U+03B3>-activated mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) and escapes from the vacuole, suggesting that IFN<U+03B3> acts by blocking S.
flexneri replication in the cytosol. This restriction on cytosolic growth was
dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), an IFN<U+03B3>-inducible
transcription factor capable of inducing IFN<U+03B3>-mediated cell-autonomous immunity. 
To identify host factors that restrict S. flexneri growth, we used whole genome
microarrays to identify mammalian genes whose expression in S. flexneri-infected 
cells is controlled by IFN<U+03B3> and IRF1. Among the genes we identified was the
pattern recognition receptor (PRR) retanoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a
cytoplasmic sensor of foreign RNA that had not been previously known to play a
role in S. flexneri infection. We found that RIG-I and its downstream signaling
adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)--but not cytosolic
Nod-like receptors (NLRs)--are critically important for IFN<U+03B3>-mediated S. flexneri
growth restriction. The recently described RNA polymerase III pathway, which
transcribes foreign cytosolic DNA into the RIG-I ligand 5'-triphosphate RNA,
appeared to be involved in this restriction. The finding that RIG-I responds to
S. flexneri infection during the IFN<U+03B3> response extends the range of PRRs that are
capable of recognizing this bacterium. Additionally, these findings expand our
understanding of how IFN<U+03B3> recognizes, and ultimately restricts, bacterial
pathogens within host cells.

The Janus kinase-2 (Jak2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3) pathway is critical for promoting an oncogenic and metastatic phenotype
in several types of cancer including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma.
This study describes two small molecule inhibitors of the Jak2-STAT3 pathway,
FLLL32 and its more soluble analog, FLLL62. These compounds are structurally
distinct curcumin analogs that bind selectively to the SH2 domain of STAT3 to
inhibit its phosphorylation and dimerization. We hypothesized that FLLL32 and
FLLL62 would induce apoptosis in RCC and melanoma cells and display specificity
for the Jak2-STAT3 pathway. FLLL32 and FLLL62 could inhibit STAT3 dimerization in
vitro. These compounds reduced basal STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3), and induced 
apoptosis in four separate human RCC cell lines and in human melanoma cell lines 
as determined by Annexin V/PI staining. Apoptosis was also confirmed by
immunoblot analysis of caspase-3 processing and PARP cleavage. Pre-treatment of
RCC and melanoma cell lines with FLLL32/62 did not inhibit IFN-<U+03B3>-induced pSTAT1. 
In contrast to FLLL32, curcumin and FLLL62 reduced downstream STAT1-mediated gene
expression of IRF1 as determined by Real Time PCR. FLLL32 and FLLL62
significantly reduced secretion of VEGF from RCC cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner as determined by ELISA. Finally, each of these compounds inhibited in
vitro generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These data support further 
investigation of FLLL32 and FLLL62 as lead compounds for STAT3 inhibition in RCC 
and melanoma.

Type I IFNs are induced by pathogens to protect the host from infection and boost
the immune response. We have recently demonstrated that this IFN response is not 
restricted to pathogens, as the Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus
acidophilus, a natural inhabitant of the intestine, induces high levels of IFN-ß 
in dendritic cells. In the current study, we investigate the intracellular
pathways involved in IFN-ß upon stimulation of dendritic cells with L.
acidophilus and reveal that this IFN-ß induction requires phagosomal uptake and
processing but bypasses the endosomal receptors TLR7 and TLR9. The IFN-ß
production is fully dependent on the TIR adapter molecule MyD88, partly dependent
on IFN regulatory factor (IRF)1, but independent of the TIR domain-containing
adapter inducing IFN-ß MyD88 adapter-like, IRF and IRF7. However, our results
suggest that IRF3 and IRF7 have complementary roles in IFN-ß signaling. The IFN-ß
production is strongly impaired by inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and
PI3K. Our results indicate that L. acidophilus induces IFN-ß independently of the
receptors typically used by bacteria, as it requires MyD88, Syk, and PI3K
signaling and phagosomal processing to activate IRF1 and IRF3/IRF7 and thereby
the release of IFN-ß.

Targeting of Noncanonical Wnt5a Signaling by AP-1 Blocker Dominant-Negative Jun
When It Inhibits Skin Carcinogenesis.

USA.

The transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein-1) regulates a number of genes
that drive tumor promotion and progression. While basal levels of AP-1 activity
are important for normal cell proliferation and cell survival, overactivated
AP-1-dependent gene expression stimulates inflammation, angiogenesis, invasion,
and other events that propel carcinogenesis. We seek to discover genes targeted
by carcinogenesis inhibitors that do not also inhibit cell proliferation or
survival. Transgenic TAM67 (dominant-negative c-Jun) inhibits mouse skin
tumorigenesis and tumor progression without inhibiting cell proliferation or
induced hyperproliferation. Expression profiling of wild-type and K14-TAM67 mouse
epidermis has revealed a number of functionally significant genes that are
induced by tumor promoters in wild-type mice but not in those expressing the AP-1
blocker. The current study now identifies Wnt5a signaling as a new target of
TAM67 when it inhibits DMBA/TPA-induced carcinogenesis. Wnt5a is required to
maintain the tumor phenotype in tumorigenic mouse JB6 cells and Ras-transformed
human squamous carcinoma HaCaT-II4 cells, as Wnt5a knockdown suppresses
anchorage-independent and tumor xenograft growth. The oncogenic Wnt5a-mediated
pathway signals through activation of the protein kinase PKCa and oncogenic
transcription factor STAT3 phosphorylation and not through the canonical
Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. Similar to Wnt5a knockdown, inhibitors of PKCa blocked
STAT3 activation in both mouse JB6 and human HaCaT-II4 tumor cells. Moreover,
expression of STAT3-regulated genes FAS, MMP3, IRF1, and cyclin D1 was suppressed
with Wnt5a knockdown. Treatment of mouse Wnt5a knockdown cells with a
PKCa-specific activator rescued phosphorylation of STAT3. Thus, Wnt5a signaling
is required for maintaining the tumor phenotype in squamous carcinoma cells,
Wnt5a targeting by the AP-1 blockade contributes to inhibition of skin
carcinogenesis, and the signaling pathway traverses PKCa and STAT3 activation.
Coordinate overactivation of Wnt5a expression and STAT3 signaling is observed in 
human skin and colon cancers as well as glioblastoma.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) shows tumor-suppressor activity by
suppressing proliferation of cancer cells. To exert its anti-proliferative
effects, this factor must ultimately control transcription of several key genes
that regulate cell cycle progression. Here, we showed that Ki-67 gene is a novel 
proliferation-related downstream target of IRF1. IRF1 repressed Ki-67 gene
transcription in a dose-dependent manner in human Ketr-3 and 786-O renal
carcinoma cells. We previously cloned the Ki-67 core promoter which contained two
functional Sp1 binding sites. Mutation of the two Sp1 binding sites abrogated
Sp1-dependent enhancement of Ki-67 promoter activity. Forced elevation of IRF1
decreased endogenous Sp1 protein level. However, there was no effect on Sp1 mRNA 
level after transfected with IRF1. Our findings establish a casual series of
events that connect anti-proliferative effects of IRF1 with the Ki-67 gene, which
encodes a key regulator of the G1/S phase transition. It suggests that the
inhibitory effect on Ki-67 gene expression mediated by decreasing level of Sp1
protein might be a novel function of the anti-tumor activity of IRF1.

Genes encoding IRF1 and IRF8 protein have been proposed as candidate tuberculosis
susceptibility genes. In order to elucidate whether the IRF1 and IRF8 variants
were associated with tuberculosis susceptibility, we conducted a case-control
study consisting of 495 controls and 452 ethnically matched cases with
tuberculosis in a Chinese population. Seven haplotype tagging single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs2057656; rs2706381; rs2070724; rs2070721; rs2549008;
rs2549007; rs2706386) from HapMap database were analyzed, which provided an
almost complete coverage of the genetic variations in the IRF1 gene. Fifteen
tagSNPs (rs12924316; rs182511; rs305080; rs2292980; rs925994; rs424971;
rs16939967; rs11117415; rs4843860; rs9926411; rs8064189; rs12929551; rs10514611; 
rs1044873; rs6638) were observed in the IRF8 gene. All these tagSNPs were
genotyped by SNPstream genotyping and SNaPshot typing. None of the seven tagSNPs 
was individually associated with tuberculosis in the IRF1 gene. In the IRF8 gene,
interestingly, we found that three tagSNPs (rs925994 and rs11117415 located in
the intron region; rs10514611 located in the 3'UTR) were associated with risk of 
tuberculosis after Bonferroni correction. Per allele OR was 1.75 (95% CI 1.35 ~
2.27, P = 0.002), 4.75 (95% CI 2.16 ~ 10.43, P = 0.002) and 3.39 (95% CI 1.60 ~
7.20, P = 0.015) respectively. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the
construct that contained the non-risk allele C of rs10514611 showed significantly
higher luciferase activity than did the risk T allele (P<0.01), which implied
rs10514611 was a potential functional SNP site. Our results indicated that the
IRF8 gene might participate in genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis in a

RATIONALE: A high-fat diet accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia increases an
individual's risk for development of atherosclerosis. An early event in this
process is monocyte recruitment through binding to vascular cell adhesion
molecule 1 (VCAM-1) upregulated on inflamed arterial endothelium. Diets high in
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may provide athero-protection by ameliorating
this effect.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the acute regulation of VCAM-1 expression in human
aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) in response to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
(TGRL) isolated from subjects after consumption of a high-fat meal.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Postprandial TGRL isolated from 38 subjects were categorized
as proatherogenic or antiatherogenic according to their capacity to alter the
inflammatory response of HAEC. Proatherogenic TGRL increased expression of
VCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin by 20%
compared with stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-a alone, whereas
antiatherogenic TGRL decreased VCAM-1 expression by 20% while still upregulating
ICAM-1. The relative atherogenicity of TGRL positively correlated with particle
density of TG, apolipoprotein (Apo)CIII, ApoE, and cholesterol. O3-PUFA mimicked 
the effect of antiatherogenic TGRL by downregulating VCAM-1 expression. TGRL
exerted this differential regulation of VCAM-1 by reciprocally modulating
expression and activity of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 
1 (IRF-1) and expression of microRNA 126 (miR-126). Overexpression or silencing
of IRF-1 or miR-126 expression recapitulated the proatherogenic or
antiatherogenic regulation of VCAM-1.
CONCLUSIONS: In response to a high-fat meal, TGRL bias the inflammatory response 
of endothelium via transcriptional and posttranscriptional editing of VCAM-1.
Subjects with an anti-inflammatory response to a meal produced TGRL that was
enriched in nonesterified fatty acids, decreased IRF-1 expression, increased
miR-126 activity, and diminished monocyte arrest.

A systems biology approach to the global analysis of transcription factors in
colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Biological entities do not perform in isolation, and often, it is the
nature and degree of interactions among numerous biological entities which
ultimately determines any final outcome. Hence, experimental data on any single
biological entity can be of limited value when considered only in isolation. To
address this, we propose that augmenting individual entity data with the
literature will not only better define the entity's own significance but also
uncover relationships with novel biological entities.To test this notion, we
developed a comprehensive text mining and computational methodology that focused 
on discovering new targets of one class of molecular entities, transcription
factors (TF), within one particular disease, colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We used 39 molecular entities known to be associated with CRC along with
six colorectal cancer terms as the bait list, or list of search terms, for mining
the biomedical literature to identify CRC-specific genes and proteins. Using the 
literature-mined data, we constructed a global TF interaction network for CRC. We
then developed a multi-level, multi-parametric methodology to identify TFs to
CRC.
RESULTS: The small bait list, when augmented with literature-mined data,
identified a large number of biological entities associated with CRC. The
relative importance of these TF and their associated modules was identified using
functional and topological features. Additional validation of these highly-ranked
TF using the literature strengthened our findings. Some of the novel TF that we
identified were: SLUG, RUNX1, IRF1, HIF1A, ATF-2, ABL1, ELK-1 and GATA-1. Some of
these TFs are associated with functional modules in known pathways of CRC,
including the Beta-catenin/development, immune response, transcription, and DNA
damage pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Our methodology of using text mining data and a multi-level,
multi-parameter scoring technique was able to identify both known and novel TF
that have roles in CRC. Starting with just one TF (SMAD3) in the bait list, the
literature mining process identified an additional 116 CRC-associated TFs. Our
network-based analysis showed that these TFs all belonged to any of 13 major
functional groups that are known to play important roles in CRC. Among these
identified TFs, we obtained a novel six-node module consisting of
ATF2-P53-JNK1-ELK1-EPHB2-HIF1A, from which the novel JNK1-ELK1 association could 
potentially be a significant marker for CRC.

While the link between malignancy and vasculitis has been known for some time,
the association of vasculitis and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has only
recently been reported. This article reviews the most current and landmark
publications regarding MDS, as well as malignancy-associated vasculitis. We
include theories of paraneoplastic associations, immune pathogenesis including an
associated cytokine transcriptional factor (interferon regulatory factor-1
[IFN-1]), and the relationship to treatment. Key clinical features that suggest
underlying malignancy in patients with vasculitis are highlighted. Although the
association between vasculitis and malignancy is rare, leukocytoclastic
vasculitis is the most common vasculitis associated with MDS, hematologic
malignancies as well as solid tumors. We review several articles that demonstrate
a paraneoplastic association between vasculitis and various malignancies, but
overall, the connection is still unclear and not well defined. Certain features
that suggest a true paraneoplastic association are outlined. Further studies are 
needed to advance our understanding of this complex topic.

Yogic meditation reverses NF-<U+03BA>B and IRF-related transcriptome dynamics in
leukocytes of family dementia caregivers in a randomized controlled trial.

Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Although yoga and meditation have been used for stress reduction with
reported improvement in inflammation, little is known about the biological
mechanisms mediating such effects. The present study examined if a yogic
meditation might alter the activity of inflammatory and antiviral transcription
control pathways that shape immune cell gene expression.
METHODS: Forty-five family dementia caregivers were randomized to either Kirtan
Kriya Meditation (KKM) or Relaxing Music (RM) listening for 12 min daily for 8
weeks and 39 caregivers completed the study. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles
were collected from peripheral blood leukocytes sampled at baseline and 8-week
follow-up. Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses tested the hypothesis that
observed transcriptional alterations were structured by reduced activity of the
pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B family of transcription factors and
increased activity of Interferon Response Factors (IRFs; i.e., reversal of
patterns previously linked to stress).
RESULTS: In response to KKM treatment, 68 genes were found to be differentially
expressed (19 up-regulated, 49 down-regulated) after adjusting for potentially
confounded differences in sex, illness burden, and BMI. Up-regulated genes
included immunoglobulin-related transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts included 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation-related immediate-early genes.
Transcript origin analyses identified plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B
lymphocytes as the primary cellular context of these transcriptional alterations 
(both p<.001). Promoter-based bioinformatic analysis implicated reduced NF-<U+03BA>B
signaling and increased activity of IRF1 in structuring those effects (both
p<.05).
CONCLUSION: A brief daily yogic meditation intervention may reverse the pattern
of increased NF-<U+03BA>B-related transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
decreased IRF1-related transcription of innate antiviral response genes
previously observed in healthy individuals confronting a significant life
stressor.

Despite convincing evidence for involvement of members of the Toll-like receptor 
(TLR) family in fungal recognition, little is known of the functional role of
individual TLRs in antifungal defenses. We found here that TLR7 was partially
required for the induction of IL-12 (IL-12p70) by Candida albicans or
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the IL-12p70 response was completely
abrogated in cells from 3d mice, which are unable to mobilize TLRs to endosomal
compartments, as well as in cells from mice lacking either the TLR adaptor MyD88 
or the IRF1 transcription factor. Notably, purified fungal RNA recapitulated
IL-12p70 induction by whole yeast. Although RNA could also induce moderate
TLR7-dependent IL-23 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) secretion, TLR7 and 
other endosomal TLRs were redundant for IL-23 or TNF-a induction by whole fungi. 
Importantly, mice lacking TLR7 or IRF1 were hypersusceptible to systemic C.
albicans infection. Our data suggest that IRF1 is downstream of a novel,
nonredundant fungal recognition pathway that has RNA as a major target and
requires phagosomal recruitment of intracellular TLRs. This pathway differs from 
those involved in IL-23 or TNF-a responses, which we show here to be independent 
from translocation of intracellular TLRs, phagocytosis, or phagosomal
acidification.

MicroRNAs are major players in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Even small
changes in miRNA levels may have profound consequences for the expression levels 
of target genes. Hence, miRNAs themselves need to be tightly, albeit dynamically,
regulated. Here, we investigated the dynamic behavior of miRNAs over a wide time 
range following stimulation of melanoma cells with interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>), which
activates the transcription factor STAT1. By applying several bioinformatic and
statistical software tools for visualization and identification of differentially
expressed miRNAs derived from time-series microarray experiments, 8.9% of 1105
miRNAs appeared to be directly or indirectly regulated by STAT1. Focusing on
distinct dynamic expression patterns, we found that the majority of robust miRNA 
expression changes occurred in the intermediate time range (24-48 h). Three
miRNAs (miR-27a, miR-30a, miR-34a) had a delayed regulation occurring at 72 h
while none showed significant expression changes at early time points between 30 
min and 6 h. Expression patterns of individual miRNAs were altered gradually over
time or abruptly increased or decreased between two time points. Furthermore, we 
observed coordinated dynamic transcription of most miRNA clusters while few were 
found to be regulated independently of their genetic cluster. Most interestingly,
several "star" or passenger strand sequences were specifically regulated over
time while their "guide" strands were not.

Hepatitis C virus-mediated inhibition of cathepsin S increases invariant-chain
expression on hepatocyte surface.

Hepatocytes are the main source of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and
contain the maximum viral load in an infected person. Chronic HCV infection is
characterized by weak cellular immune responses to viral proteins. Cathepsin S is
a lysosomal cysteine protease and controls HLA-DR-antigen complex presentation
through the degradation of the invariant chain. In this study, we examined the
effect of HCV proteins on cathepsin S expression and found it to be markedly
decreased in dendritic cells (DCs) exposed to HCV or in hepatocytes expressing
HCV proteins. The downregulation of cathepsin S was mediated by HCV core and NS5A
proteins involving inhibition of the transcription factors interferon regulatory 
factor 1 (IRF-1) and upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1) in gamma interferon
(IFN-<U+03B3>)-treated hepatocytes. Inhibition of cathepsin S by HCV proteins increased 
cell surface expression of the invariant chain. In addition, hepatocytes stably
transfected with HCV core or NS5A inhibited HLA-DR expression. Together, these
results suggested that HCV has an inhibitory role on cathepsin S-mediated major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II maturation, which may contribute to
weak immunogenicity of viral antigens in chronically infected humans.

Toll-like receptor 3 and suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins regulate CXCR4
and CXCR7 expression in bone marrow-derived human multipotent stromal cells.

Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: The use of bone marrow-derived human multipotent stromal cells (hMSC)
in cell-based therapies has dramatically increased in recent years, as
researchers have exploited the ability of these cells to migrate to sites of
tissue injury, inflammation, and tumors. Our group established that hMSC respond 
to "danger" signals--by-products of damaged, infected or inflamed tissues--via
activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, little is known regarding
downstream signaling mediated by TLRs in hMSC.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that TLR3 stimulation activates a 
Janus kinase (JAK) 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1
pathway, and increases expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1
and SOCS3 in hMSC. Our studies suggest that each of these SOCS plays a distinct
role in negatively regulating TLR3 and JAK/STAT signaling. TLR3-mediated
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) expression was inhibited by SOCS3
overexpression in hMSC while SOCS1 overexpression reduced STAT1 activation.
Furthermore, our study is the first to demonstrate that when TLR3 is activated in
hMSC, expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 is downregulated. SOCS3 overexpression
inhibited internalization of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 following TLR3 stimulation. In 
contrast, SOCS1 overexpression only inhibited CXCR7 internalization.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that SOCS1 and SOCS3 each play
a functionally distinct role in modulating TLR3, JAK/STAT, and CXCR4/CXCR7
signaling in hMSC and shed further light on the way hMSC respond to danger
signals.

Interferon regulatory factor-2 is protective against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion
injury.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is a nuclear transcription factor that
induces inflammatory cytokine mediators and contributes to hepatic
ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. No strategies to mitigate IRF1-mediated liver 
damage exist. IRF2 is a structurally similar endogenous protein that competes
with IRF1 for DNA binding sites in IRF-responsive target genes and acts as a
competitive inhibitor. However, the role of IRF2 in hepatic injury during hypoxic
or inflammatory conditions is unknown. We hypothesize that IRF2 overexpression
may mitigate IRF1-mediated I/R damage. Endogenous IRF2 is basally expressed in
normal livers and is mildly increased by ischemia alone. Overexpression of IRF2
protects against hepatic warm I/R injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IRF2
overexpression limits production of IRF1-dependent proinflammatory genes, such as
IL-12, IFNß, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, even in the presence of IRF1
induction. Additionally, isograft liver transplantation with IRF2 heterozygote
knockout (IRF2(+/-)) donor grafts that have reduced endogenous IRF2 levels
results in worse injury following cold I/R during murine orthotopic liver
transplantation. These findings indicate that endogenous intrahepatic IRF2
protein is protective, because the IRF2-deficient liver donor grafts exhibited
increased liver damage compared with the wild-type donor grafts. In summary, IRF2
overexpression protects against I/R injury by decreasing IRF1-dependent injury
and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.

The limited role of interferon-<U+03B3> in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis cannot
be explained by cellular hyporesponsiveness.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoinflammatory
syndrome in which the myelomonocytic lineage appears to play a pivotal role.
Inflammatory macrophages are driven by interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN<U+03B3>), but studies have
failed to demonstrate an IFN- induced gene signature in active systemic JIA. This
study sought to characterize the status of an IFN-induced signature within
affected tissue and to gauge the integrity of IFN signaling pathways within
peripheral monocytes from patients with systemic JIA.
METHODS: Synovial tissue from 12 patients with active systemic JIA and 9 with
active extended oligoarticular JIA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain
reaction to quantify IFN-induced chemokine gene expression. Peripheral monocytes 
from 3 patients with inactive systemic JIA receiving anti-interleukin-1ß
(anti-IL-1ß) therapy, 5 patients with active systemic JIA, and 8 healthy controls
were incubated with or without IFN<U+03B3> to gauge changes in gene expression and to
measure phosphorylated STAT-1 (pSTAT-1) levels.
RESULTS: IFN-induced chemokine gene expression in synovium was constrained in
active systemic JIA compared to the known IFN-mediated extended oligoarticular
subtype. In unstimulated peripheral monocytes, IFN-induced gene expression was
similar between the groups, except that lower levels of STAT1, MIG, and PIAS were
observed in patients with active disease, while higher levels of PIAS1 were
observed in patients with inactive disease. Basal pSTAT-1 levels in monocytes
tended to be higher in systemic JIA patients compared to healthy controls, with
the highest levels seen in those with inactive disease. Upon stimulation of
monocytes, the fold increase in gene expression was roughly equal between groups,
except for a greater increase in STAT1 in patients with inactive systemic JIA
compared to controls, and a greater increase in IRF1 in those with active
compared to inactive disease. Upon stimulation, the fold increase in pSTAT-1 was 
highest in monocytes from patients with inactive systemic JIA.
CONCLUSION: Monocytes in patients with active systemic JIA retain the ability to 
respond to IFN<U+03B3>, suggesting that the lack of an IFN-induced gene signature in
patients with active disease reflects a limited in vivo exposure to IFN<U+03B3>. In
patients with inactive systemic JIA who received treatment with anti-IL-1ß,
hyperresponsiveness to IFN<U+03B3> was observed.

cancer patients].

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the expressions of Th1 cytokines in 
gastric cancer tissue and the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer after
radical resection.
METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with gastric cancer treated at the Zhongshan
Hospital of Fudan University were retrospectively analyzed. The expressions of
Th1 cytokines mRNA were detected in tumor tissues by real-time polymerase chain
reaction(RT-PCR) method in Th1 cells including TRAV10, IRF1, TBX21, CD3Z, GZMB,
GATA3, and IFNG. Association of Th1 cytokines mRNA expressions and prognosis was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The median follow up was 42.5(1-64) months. The 1-year survival rate was
84.5% and the 3-year survival rate was 72.4%. Univariate Cox regression analysis 
showed that lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM staging,
lymphovascular invasion, GNLY mRNA expression, and the overall expression level
of the 8 types of Th1 cells were associated with the prognosis of patients with
gastric cancer(all P<0.05). The 3-year survival was 86.2% in patients with
increased expression of mRNA and 58.6% in those with decreased expression. The
3-year survival was 79.6% in patients with any increase in the 8 Th1 cytokines
and 33.3% in those with consistent downregulation of the 8 cytokines.
Multivariate Cox analysis showed that lymph node metastasis and the overall
expression level of 8 Th1 cytokines were independent risk factors associated with
the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer in this cohort(both P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA expression of GNLY is associated with the prognosis of
patients with gastric cancer but is not an independent risk factor. The
combination of mRNA expressions of the eight cytokines is an independent
prognostic factor.

Genomic analysis of between-cow variation in dermal fibroblast response to
lipopolysaccharide.

Kandasamy S(1), Kerr DE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences,
University of Vermont, Burlington 05405, USA.

The innate immune response plays a major role in defense against mastitis-causing
pathogens. Identification of existing variation in innate immune signaling among 
cows and the underlying molecular causes for the variation may help in design of 
new mastitis control strategies. The dermal fibroblast has been used as a model
cell type to explore between-cow variation in the ability of cells to produce
IL-8 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, and this response appears
related to an animal's ability to respond to in vivo challenge with LPS or
Escherichia coli mastitis. In this study, primary dermal fibroblast cultures of
cows and microarray-based genomic analysis were used to investigate the cause(s) 
for the variable response to LPS. Fibroblast cultures from 2 cows, one with a low
response phenotype (LR(array)) and another with a high response phenotype
(HR(array)), were selected from our collection of fibroblast cultures established
from 88 cows. The LR(array) fibroblast culture produced approximately 5-fold less
IL-8 and IL-6 protein in response to 24-h LPS treatment than the HR(array)
fibroblast culture. Genomic analysis of RNA obtained from 3 replicates of the 2
cultures before and after 8-h LPS treatment revealed a combined LPS-induced
differential expression of 321 transcripts, indicating the robust response
capability of the fibroblast cell. Under basal conditions, the microarray
analysis revealed 2-fold less expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the
LR(array) fibroblasts compared with the HR(array) fibroblasts, and this was
associated with a marked reduction in expression of genes regulated by the
TLR4-MyD88-dependent and TLR4-TRIF-dependent pathways (IL-8, IL-6, SAA3, CCL20,
MX1, IRF1, and ISG20). The between-culture differential expression of TLR4 was
confirmed and extended by quantitative PCR analysis (QPCR) that revealed a
33-fold lower expression of TLR4 in the LR(array) fibroblast culture. After LPS
treatment, the difference in TLR4 expression increased to almost 50-fold and was 
associated with more than 8-fold lower expression of IL-8 and IL-6. No DNA
sequence variations were identified in the proximal 1,300-bp promoter region of
the TLR4 gene, and microarray analysis did not reveal a molecular explanation for
the reduced TLR4 expression under either basal conditions or following exposure
to LPS. The attenuated innate immune response of the LR(array) fibroblast culture
to LPS may be caused by reduced TLR4 receptor expression. Also, the primary
dermal fibroblast cells can be used to examine underlying causes for between-cow 
variations in key immune response pathways.

Tumor suppressor PML is induced under viral and genotoxic stresses by interferons
and JAK-STAT signaling. However, the mechanism responsible for its cell
type-specific regulation under non-stimulated conditions is poorly understood. To
analyze the variation of PML expression, we utilized three human cell types, BJ
fibroblasts and HeLa and U2OS cell lines, each with a distinct PML expression
pattern. Analysis of JAK-STAT signaling in the three cell lines revealed
differences in levels of activated STAT3 but not STAT1 correlating with PML mRNA 
and protein levels. RNAi-mediated knockdown of STAT3 decreased PML expression;
both STAT3 level/activity and PML expression relied on IL6 secreted into culture 
media. We mapped the IL6-responsive sequence to an ISRE(-595/-628) element of the
PML promoter. The PI3K/Akt/NF<U+03BA>B branch of IL6 signaling showed also cell-type
dependence, being highest in BJ, intermediate in HeLa, and lowest in U2OS cells
and correlated with IL6 secretion. RNAi-mediated knockdown of NEMO (NF-<U+03BA>-B
essential modulator), a key component of NF<U+03BA>B activation, suppressed NF<U+03BA>B targets
LMP2 and IRF1 together with STAT3 and PML. Combined knockdown of STAT3 and NEMO
did not further promote PML suppression, and it can be bypassed by exogenous IL6,
indicating the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway acts upstream of JAK-STAT3 through induction of IL6.
Our results indicate that the cell type-specific activity of IL6 signaling
pathways governs PML expression under unperturbed growth conditions. As IL6 is
induced in response to various viral and genotoxic stresses, this cytokine may
regulate autocrine/paracrine induction of PML under these pathophysiological
states as part of tissue adaptation to local stress.

The Brazilian Amazon is a hypo-endemic malaria region with nearly 300,000 cases
each year. A variety of genetic polymorphisms, particularly in erythrocyte
receptors and immune response related genes, have been described to be associated
with susceptibility and resistance to malaria. In order to identify polymorphisms
that might be associated with malaria clinical outcomes in a Brazilian Amazonian 
population, sixty-four human single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37 genes were
analyzed using a Sequenom massARRAY iPLEX platform. A total of 648 individuals
from two malaria endemic areas were studied, including 535 malaria cases (113
individuals with clinical mild malaria, 122 individuals with asymptomatic
infection and 300 individuals with history of previous mild malaria) and 113
health controls with no history of malaria. The data revealed significant
associations (p<0.003) between one SNP in the IL10 gene (rs1800896) and one SNP
in the TLR4 gene (rs4986790) with reduced risk for clinical malaria, one SNP in
the IRF1 gene (rs2706384) with increased risk for clinical malaria, one SNP in
the LTA gene (rs909253) with protection from clinical malaria and one SNP in the 
TNF gene (RS1800750) associated with susceptibility to clinical malaria. Also, a 
new association was found between a SNP in the CTL4 gene (rs2242665), located at 
the major histocompatibility complex III region, and reduced risk for clinical
malaria. This study represents the first association study from an Amazonian
population involving a large number of host genetic polymorphisms with
susceptibility or resistance to Plasmodium infection and malaria outcomes.
Further studies should include a larger number of individuals, refined parameters
and a fine-scale map obtained through DNA sequencing to increase the knowledge of
the Amazonian population genetic diversity.

University, Wuhan, P. R. China.

CD56+ T cells, the crucial component of the host innate immune system, play an
important role in defense against viral infections. We investigated the
noncytolytic anti-HIV-1 activity of primary CD56+ T cells. SNs collected from
CD56+ T cell cultures inhibited HIV-1 infection and replication. This CD56+ T
SN-mediated anti-HIV-1 activity was broad-spectrum, as CD56+ T SNs could inhibit 
infections by laboratory-adapted and clinical strains of HIV-1. The antibody to
IFN-<U+03B3> could partially block the CD56+ T SN-mediated anti-HIV effect.
Investigation of mechanism(s) of the CD56+ T cell action on HIV-1 showed that
although CD56+ T SN had little effect on HIV-1 entry coreceptor CCR5 expression, 
CD56+ T SN induced the expression of CC-chemokines, the ligands for CCR5. The
antibodies to CC-chemokines also significantly blocked CD56+ T SN-mediated
anti-HIV activity. Furthermore, CD56+ T SN up-regulated the expression of
STAT-1/-2 and enhanced the expression of IRF1, -3, -7, and -9, resulting in the
induction of endogenous IFN-a/ß expression in macrophages. Moreover, CD56+ T SN
up-regulated intracellular expression of APOBEC3G/3F, the recently identified
HIV-1 restriction factors. These findings provide compelling evidence that CD56+ 
T cells may have a critical role in innate immunity against HIV-1 infection.

Definition of IFN-<U+03B3>-related pathways critical for chemically-induced systemic
autoimmunity.

IFN-<U+03B3> is essential for idiopathic and murine mercury-induced systemic
autoimmunity (mHgIA), and heterozygous IFN-<U+03B3>(+/-) mice also exhibit reduced
disease. This suggests that blocking specific IFN-<U+03B3>-related pathways that may
only partially inhibit IFN-<U+03B3> production or function will also suppress
autoimmunity. To test this hypothesis, mice deficient in genes regulating IFN-<U+03B3>
expression (Casp1, Nlrp3, Il12a, Il12b, Stat4) or function (Ifngr1, Irf1) were
examined for mHgIA susceptibility. Absence of either Ifngr1 or Irf1 resulted in a
striking reduction of disease, while deficiency of genes promoting IFN-<U+03B3>
expression had modest to no effect. Furthermore, both Irf1- and Ifng-deficiency
only modestly reduced the expansion of CD44(hi) and CD44(hi)CD55(lo) CD4(+) T
cells, indicating that they are not absolutely required for T cell activation.
Thus, there is substantial redundancy in genes that regulate IFN-<U+03B3> expression in 
contrast to those that mediate later signaling events. These findings have
implications for the therapeutic targeting of IFN-<U+03B3> pathways in systemic
autoimmunity.

CD40 stimulates a "feed-forward" NF-<U+03BA>B-driven molecular pathway that regulates
IFN-ß expression in carcinoma cells.

IFN-ß and the CD40L (CD154) share important roles in the antiviral and antitumor 
immune responses. In this study, we show that CD40 receptor occupancy results in 
IFN-ß upregulation through an unconventional "feed-forward" mechanism, which is
orchestrated by canonical NF-<U+03BA>B and involves the sequential de novo synthesis of 
IFN regulatory factor (IRF)1 and Viperin (RSAD2), an IRF1 target. RelA (p65)
NF-<U+03BA>B, IRF1, and Viperin-dependent IRF7 binding to the IFN-ß promoter largely
controls its activity. However, full activation of IFN-ß also requires the
parallel engagement of noncanonical NF-<U+03BA>B2 signaling leading to p52 recruitment
to the IFN-ß promoter. These data define a novel link between CD40 signaling and 
IFN-ß expression and provide a telling example of how signal propagation can be
exploited to ensure efficient regulation of gene expression.

mass.

Maternal thinness leads to metabolic challenges in the offspring, but it is
unclear whether reduced maternal fat mass or muscle mass drives these metabolic
changes. Recently, it has been shown that low maternal muscle mass--as measured
by arm muscle area (AMA)--is associated with depressed nutrient transport to the 
fetus. To determine the role of maternal muscle mass on placental function, we
analyzed the gene expression profiles of 30 human placentas over the range of AMA
(25.2-90.8 cm(2)) from uncomplicated term pregnancies from the Southampton
Women's Survey cohort. Eighteen percent of the ~60 genes that were highly
expressed in less muscular women were related to immune system processes and the 
interferon-<U+03B3> (IFNG) signaling pathway in particular. Those transcripts related to
the IFNG pathway included IRF1, IFI27, IFI30, and GBP6. Placentas from women with
low muscularity are, perhaps, more sensitive to the effects of inflammatory
cytokines than those from more muscular women.

Differential impact of interferon regulatory factor 7 in initiation of the type I
interferon response in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-infected central
nervous system versus the periphery.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors 
involved in regulating type I IFN genes and other genes participating in the
early antiviral host response. To better understand the mechanisms involved in
virus-induced central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, we studied the influence
of IRF1, -3, -7, and -9 on the transcriptional activity of key genes encoding
antiviral host factors in the CNS of mice infected with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). A key finding is that neither IRF3 nor IRF7 is
absolutely required for induction of a type I IFN response in the LCMV-infected
CNS, whereas concurrent elimination of both factors markedly reduces the
virus-induced host response. This is unlike the situation in the periphery, where
deficiency of IRF7 almost eliminates the LCMV-induced production of the type I
IFNs. This difference is seemingly related to the local environment, as
peripheral production of type I IFNs is severely reduced in intracerebrally
(i.c.) infected IRF7-deficient mice, which undergo a combined infection of the
CNS and peripheral organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes. Interestingly, despite
the redundancy of IRF7 in initiating the type I IFN response in the CNS, the
response is not abolished in IFN-ß-deficient mice, as might have been expected.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that the early type I IFN response to LCMV
infection in the CNS is controlled by a concerted action of IRF3 and -7.
Consequently this work provides strong evidence for differential regulation of
the type I IFN response in the CNS versus the periphery during viral infection.

[Role of auto-secreted interferon a in all-trans retinoic acid-induced expression
of RIG-G gene].

[Article in Chinese]

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between interferon (IFN) a and all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced signaling pathways in the expression of retinoic
acid-induced gene G (RIG-G).
METHODS: Acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT)1-deficient U3A cells were used. The protein
levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 in ATRA-treated NB4 cells were detected
by Western blot. The culture supernatants of NB4 cells treated with ATRA for
different time or U3A cells transfected with interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1
were respectively collected. And the concentration of IFN-a was determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effects of NB4 cell culture
supernatants on the phosphorylation of STAT2 and the expression of RIG-G were
detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: The level of phosphorylated-STAT2 was obviously up-regulated in NB4
cells treated with ATRA for 72 hours, as well as the concentration of IFN-a in
culture supernatants. The concentration of IFN-a increased from (1.5 ± 0.5) pg/ml
in the untreated group to (7.6 ± 0.3) pg/ml (P < 0.05). After a 96-hour
treatment, the concentration of IFN-a was up to (63.8 ± 5.8) pg/ml. And these
culture supernatants could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 and
up-regulate the protein level of RIG-G. As for U3A cells transfected with IRF-1, 
the concentration of IFN-a from the culture supernatant also increased 3-fold
versus the control group transfected with empty vectors [(8.8 ± 1.4) pg/ml vs
(3.4 ± 0.4) pg/ml, P < 0.05].
CONCLUSIONS: RIG-G gene expression is closely correlated with the cross-talk
between ATRA and IFN-a-induced signaling pathways. ATRA increases the secretion
of IFN-a by up-regulating the protein level of IRF-1. Then the secreted IFN-a may
induce the phosphorylation of STAT2 and reinforce the expression of RIG-G.

The aim of our study was to examine an association between gene expression
assessed using a 23-gene microarray and receptor status of breast cancer samples 
categorized as ER positive, HER2 positive and triple negative subtypes. The ER
positive cohort was subsequently divided into Luminal A, Luminal B HER2 negative 
and Luminal B HER2 positive subtypes. Core- needle biopsies were collected from
78 female patients with inoperable locally advanced breast cancer or resectable
tumors suitable for downstaging, before any treatment. Expressions of 23 genes
were determined by means of TagMan Low Density Arrays. Analysis of variance was
used to select genes with discriminatory potential between receptor subtypes. We 
introduced a correction for false discovery rates (presented as q values) due to 
testing multiple hypothesis. Pairwise post-hoc comparisons of receptor subtypes
were performed using Tukey 's HSD test. Five genes out of a 23-gene microarray
differed significantly in relation to breast cancer receptor-based subtypes.
Among these five genes, we identified: BCL2 (p=0.0002, q=0.0009), MKI67
(p=0.0037, q=0.0064), IGF1R (p=0.0040, q=0.0064), FOXC1 (p=0.0113, q=0.0135) and 
IRF1 (p=0.0435, q=0.0416) as ones showing ER positive, HER2 positive and triple
negative -subtype specific expression profiles. When incorporating Luminal A,
Luminal B HER2 negative, Luminal B HER2 positive subtypes into analysis, four
genes: BCL2 (p=0.0006, q=0.0034), MKI67 (p=0.0078, q=0.0198), FOXC1 (p=0.0102,
q=0.0198) and IGF1R (p=0.0174, q=0.0254) were selected. Elevated levels of IGF1R 
and BCL2 were significantly linked with Luminal A subtype. Triple negative breast
cancer subtype was associated with higher expression of IRF1, FOXC1 and MKI67. In
HER2 positive cohort lower expression of all five analyzed genes was noted.

Early angiogenic response to shock waves in a three-dimensional model of human
microvascular endothelial cell culture (HMEC-1).

The exact nature of shock wave (SW) action is not, as yet, fully understood,
although a possible hypothesis may be that shock waves induce neoangiogenesis. To
test this hypothesis, a three-dimensional (3D) culture model on Matrigel was
developed employing a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) which
was stimulated with low energy soft- focused SW generated by an SW lithotripter. 
After 12 hours we observed a statistically significant increase in capillary
connections subsequent to shock-wave treatment in respect to the control group
and a marked 3-hour down-regulation in genes involved in the apoptotic processes 
(BAX, BCL2LI, GADD45A, PRKCA), in cell cycle (CDKN2C, CEBPB, HK2, IRF1, PRKCA),
oncogenes (JUN, WNT1), cell adhesion (ICAM-1), and proteolytic systems (CTSD,
KLK2, MMP10). Our preliminary results indicate that microvascular endothelial
cells in vitro quickly respond to SW, proliferating and forming vessel-like
structures, depending on the energy level employed and the number of shocks
released. The early decreased expression in the analysed genes could be
interpreted as the first reactive response of the endothelial cells to the
external stimuli and the prelude to the events characterizing the neo-angiogenic 
sequence.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is a nuclear
tyrosine/threonine phosphatase that inhibits p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) activity. We and others have shown that MKP-1 deficiency leads to
excessive activation of innate immunity and inflammatory gene expression.
Surprisingly, the present study shows that MKP-1 is a positive regulator of IL-12
expression in macrophages suggesting a stimulatory effect on Th1 type immune
response. In the present study, we found that LPS-induced expression of IL-12p40 
was lower in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages (PMs) and bone marrow-derived
macrophages from MKP-1 deficient mice than in cells from wild-type mice whereas
TNF expression was enhanced as expected. Correspondingly, the inhibition of p38
MAPK by pharmacologic inhibitors BIRB 796 and SB 202190 enhanced LPS-induced
IL-12p40 production. Silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) by siRNA 
inhibited the expression of IL-12p40 in J774 macrophages, showing that IRF1 is an
important factor regulating IL-12p40 expression. BIRB 796 enhanced LPS-induced
expression of IRF1 in J774 macrophages and in PMs from wild-type mice, and IRF1
expression was reduced in PMs from MKP-1 deficient mice. In conclusions, our
results show that MKP-1 increases and p38 MAPK decreases the expression of IL-12 
by enhancing the expression of IRF1. MKP-1, through regulation of IRF1 and IL-12,
therefore may be an important factor supporting the development of Th1 type of
immune response and anti-microbial defense.

The apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells (GMC) in rat Thy-1 nephritis
(Thy-1N), a model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, is
accompanied by sublytic C5b-9 deposition, but the mechanism of sublytic
C5b-9-mediated GMC apoptosis has not been elucidated. In the present study, the
gene expression profiles both in the GMC stimulated by sublytic C5b-9 and the rat
renal tissue of Thy-1N were detected using microarrays. Among the co-up-regulated
genes, the up-regulation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was further
confirmed. Increased caspase 8 and caspase 3 expression and caspase 8 promoter
activity in the GMC were also identified. Meanwhile, overexpression or knockdown 
of IRF-1 not only enhanced or inhibited GMC apoptosis and caspase 8 and 3
induction but also increased or decreased caspase 8 promoter activity,
respectively. The element of IRF-1 binding to the caspase 8 promoter was first
revealed. Furthermore, silencing IRF-1 or repressing the activation of caspases 8
and 3 significantly reduced GMC apoptosis, including other pathologic changes of 
Thy-1N. These novel findings indicate that GMC apoptosis of Thy-1N is associated 
with the IRF-1-activated caspase 8 pathway.

An epigenetic mechanism for high, synergistic expression of indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) by combined treatment with zebularine and IFN-<U+03B3>:
potential therapeutic use in autoimmune diseases.

Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

IDO1 can be induced by interferon gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) in multiple cell types. We have
earlier described that the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor zebularine also
induces IDO1 in several rat cell clones. We now describe a synergistic induction 
of IDO1 expression by IFN-<U+03B3> and zebularine. To elucidate the mechanism of the
IDO1 induction we have studied the methylation status in the promoter region of
the IDO1 gene from both human monocytic THP-1 cells and H1D2 rat colon cancer
cells. Interestingly, the IDO1 promoter is hypermethylated and IFN-<U+03B3> is shown to 
induce a significant demethylation. The synergism in effect of zebularine and
IFN-<U+03B3> on IDO1 expression is paralleled by a similar synergistic effect on
expression of two other IFN-<U+03B3>-responsive genes, the transcription factors STAT1
and IRF1 with binding sites in the IDO1 promoter region. The demonstrated
synergistic activation of IDO1 expression has implications in relation to
therapeutic induction of immunosuppression in autoimmunity and chronic
inflammation.

A STAT3-inhibitory hairpin decoy oligodeoxynucleotide discriminates between STAT1
and STAT3 and induces death in a human colon carcinoma cell line.

BACKGROUND: The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is
activated in tumor cells, and STAT3-inhibitors are able to induce the death of
those cells. Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (dODNs), which bind to the DNA Binding
Domain (DBD) of STAT3, are efficient inhibitors. However, they also inhibit
STAT1, whose activity is essential not only to resistance to pathogens, but also 
to cell growth inhibition and programmed cell death processes. The aim of this
study was to design STAT3-specific dODNs which do not affect STAT1-mediated
processes.
RESULTS: New dODNs with a hairpin (hpdODNs) were designed. Modifications were
introduced, based on the comparison of STAT3- and STAT1-DBD interactions with DNA
using 3D structural analyses. The designed hpdODNs were tested for their ability 
to inhibit STAT3 but not STAT1 by determining: i) cell death in the active
STAT3-dependent SW480 colon carcinoma cell line, ii) absence of inhibition of
interferon (IFN) <U+03B3>-dependent cell death, iii) expression of STAT1 targets, and
iv) nuclear location of STAT3 and STAT1. One hpdODN was found to efficiently
induce the death of SW480 cells without interfering with IFN<U+03B3>-activated STAT1.
This hpdODN was found in a complex with STAT3 but not with STAT1 using an
original in-cell pull-down assay; this hpdODN also did not inhibit IFN<U+03B3>-induced
STAT1 phosphorylation, nor did it inhibit the expression of the STAT1-target
IRF1. Furthermore, it prevented the nuclear transfer of STAT3 but not that of
IFN<U+03B3>-activated STAT1.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analyses at the atomic level revealed slight differences
in STAT3 and STAT1 DBDs' interaction with their DNA target. These were sufficient
to design a new discriminating hpdODN that inhibits STAT3 and not STAT1, thereby 
inducing tumor cell death without interfering with STAT1-dependent processes.
Preferential interaction with STAT3 depends on oligodeoxynucleotide sequence
modifications but might also result from DNA shape changes, known to modulate
protein/DNA interactions. The finding of a STAT3-specific hpdODN establishes the 
first rational basis for designing STAT3 DBD-specific inhibitors.

OBJECTIVES: The main histological change in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the
villous proliferation of synovial lining cells, an important source of cytokines 
and chemokines, which are associated with inflammation. The aim of this study was
to evaluate gene expression in the microdissected synovial lining cells of RA
patients, using those of osteoarthritis (OA) patients as the control.
METHODS: Samples were obtained during total joint replacement from 11 RA and five
OA patients. Total RNA from the synovial lining cells was derived from selected
specimens by laser microdissection (LMD) for subsequent cDNA microarray analysis.
In addition, the expression of significant genes was confirmed
immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: The 14 519 genes detected by cDNA microarray were used to compare gene
expression levels in synovial lining cells from RA with those from OA patients.
Cluster analysis indicated that RA cells, including low- and high-expression
subgroups, and OA cells were stored in two main clusters. The molecular activity 
of RA was statistically consistent with its clinical and histological activity.
Expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), 
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5
were statistically significantly higher in the synovium of RA than in that of OA.
Immunohistochemically, the lining synovium of RA, but not that of OA, clearly
expressed STAT1, IRF1, and chemokines, as was seen in microarray analysis
combined with LMD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate an important role for lining synovial cells in
the inflammatory and proliferative processes of RA. Further understanding of the 
local signalling in structural components is important in rheumatology.

Changes in synapse structure occur in frontal neocortex with HIV encephalitis
(HIVE) and may contribute to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). A
postmortem survey was conducted to determine if mRNAs involved in synaptic
transmission are perturbed in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in subjects 
with HIVE or HAND. Expression of the opioid neurotransmitter preproenkephalin
mRNA (PENK) was significantly decreased in a sampling of 446 brain specimens from
HIV-1 infected people compared to 67 HIV negative subjects. Decreased DLPFC PENK 
was most evident in subjects with HIVE and/or increased expression of interferon 
regulatory factor 1 mRNA (IRF1). Type 2 dopamine receptor mRNA (DRD2L) was
decreased significantly, but not in the same set of subjects with PENK
dysregulation. DRD2L downregulation occurred primarily in the subjects without
HIVE or neurocognitive impairment. Subjects with neurocognitive impairment often 
failed to significantly downregulate DRD2L and had abnormally high IRF1
expression.CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of synaptic preproenkephalin and DRD2L in
frontal neocortex can occur with and without neurocognitive impairment in
HIV-infected people. Downregulation of DRD2L in the prefrontal cortex was
associated with more favorable neuropsychological and neuropathological outcomes;
the failure to downregulate DRD2L was significantly less favorable. PENK
downregulation was related neuropathologically to HIVE, but was not related to
neuropsychological outcome independently. Emulating endogenous synaptic
plasticity pharmacodynamically could enhance synaptic accommodation and improve
neuropsychological and neuropathological outcomes in HIV/AIDS.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 transactivates expression of human DNA polymerase 
<U+03B7> in response to carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.

DNA polymerase <U+03B7> (Pol<U+03B7>) implements translesion DNA synthesis but has low fidelity
in replication. We have previously shown that Pol<U+03B7> plays an important role in the
genesis of nontargeted mutations at undamaged DNA sites in cells exposed to the
carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Here, we report that
MNNG-induced Pol<U+03B7> expression in an interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1)-dependent manner in human cells. Mutagenesis analysis showed that four
critical residues (Arg-82, Cys-83, Asn-86, and Ser-87) located in the IRF family 
conserved DNA binding domain-helix a3 were involved in DNA binding and POLH
transactivation by IRF1. Furthermore, Pol<U+03B7> up-regulation induced by IRF1 was
responsible for the increase of mutation frequency in a SupF shuttle plasmid
replicated in the MNNG-exposed cells. Interestingly, IRF1 was acetylated by the
histone acetyltransferase CBP in these cells. Lys <U+2192> Arg substitution revealed
that Lys-78 of helix a3 was the major acetylation site, and the IRF1-K78R
mutation partially inhibited DNA binding and its transcriptional activity. Thus, 
we propose that IRF1 activation is responsible for MNNG-induced Pol<U+03B7>
up-regulation, which contributes to mutagenesis and ultimately carcinogenesis in 
cells.

The nitric oxide pathway provides innate antiviral protection in conjunction with
the type I interferon pathway in fibroblasts.

University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

The innate host response to virus infection is largely dominated by the
production of type I interferon and interferon stimulated genes. In particular,
fibroblasts respond robustly to viral infection and to recognition of viral
signatures such as dsRNA with the rapid production of type I interferon;
subsequently, fibroblasts are a key cell type in antiviral protection. We
recently found, however, that primary fibroblasts deficient for the production of
interferon, interferon stimulated genes, and other cytokines and chemokines mount
a robust antiviral response against both DNA and RNA viruses following
stimulation with dsRNA. Nitric oxide is a chemical compound with pleiotropic
functions; its production by phagocytes in response to interferon-<U+03B3> is associated
with antimicrobial activity. Here we show that in response to dsRNA, nitric oxide
is rapidly produced in primary fibroblasts. In the presence of an intact
interferon system, nitric oxide plays a minor but significant role in antiviral
protection. However, in the absence of an interferon system, nitric oxide is
critical for the protection against DNA viruses. In primary fibroblasts, NF-<U+03BA>B
and interferon regulatory factor 1 participate in the induction of inducible
nitric oxide synthase expression, which subsequently produces nitric oxide. As
large DNA viruses encode multiple and diverse immune modulators to disable the
interferon system, it appears that the nitric oxide pathway serves as a secondary
strategy to protect the host against viral infection in key cell types, such as
fibroblasts, that largely rely on the type I interferon system for antiviral
protection.

Vaccinia virus (VACV) K1L and C7L function equivalently in many mammalian cells
to support VACV replication and antagonize antiviral activities induced by type I
interferons (IFNs). While K1L is limited to orthopoxviruses, genes that are
homologous to C7L are found in diverse mammalian poxviruses. In this study, we
showed that the C7L homologues from sheeppox virus and swinepox virus could
rescue the replication defect of a VACV mutant deleted of both K1L and C7L
(vK1L(-)C7L(-)). Interestingly, the sheeppox virus C7L homologue could rescue the
replication of vK1L(-)C7L(-) in human HeLa cells but not in murine 3T3 and LA-4
cells, in contrast to all other C7L homologues. Replacing amino acids 134 and 135
of the sheeppox virus C7L homologue, however, made it functional in the two
murine cell lines, suggesting that these two residues are critical for
antagonizing a putative host restriction factor which has some subtle sequence
variation in human and murine cells. Furthermore, the C7L family of host range
genes from diverse mammalian poxviruses were all capable of antagonizing type I
IFN-induced antiviral activities against VACV. Screening of a library of more
than 350 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) identified interferon-regulated factor 1
(IRF1) as an inhibitor of vK1L(-)C7L(-) but not wild-type VACV. Expression of
either K1L or C7L, however, rendered vK1L(-)C7L(-) resistant to IRF1-induced
antiviral activities. Altogether, our data show that K1L and C7L antagonize
IRF1-induced antiviral activities and that the host modulation function of C7L is
evolutionally conserved in all poxviruses that can readily replicate in
tissue-cultured mammalian cells.

Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant systemic treatment appears to be a
valid surrogate for better overall survival in breast cancer patients. Currently,
together with standard clinicopathologic assessment, novel molecular biomarkers
are being exhaustively tested in order to look into the heterogeneity of breast
cancer. The aim of our study was to examine an association between 23-gene
real-time-PCR expression assay including ABCB1, ABCC1, BAX, BBC3, BCL2, CASP3,
CYP2D6, ERCC1, FOXC1, GAPDH, IGF1R, IRF1, MAP2, MAPK 8, MAPK9, MKI67, MMP9,
NCOA3, PARP1, PIK3CA, TGFB3, TOP2A, and YWHAZ receptor status of breast cancer
core biopsies sampled before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (anthracycline and taxanes)
and pathologic response. Core-needle biopsies were collected from 42 female
patients with inoperable locally advanced breast cancer or resectable tumors
suitable for downstaging, before any treatment. Expressions of 23 genes were
determined by means of TagMan low density arrays. Analysis of variance was used
to select genes with discriminatory potential between receptor subtypes. We
introduced a correction for false discovery rates (presented as q values) due to 
multiple hypothesis testing. Statistical analysis showed that seven genes out of 
a 23-gene real-time-PCR expression assay differed significantly in relation to
pathologic response regardless of breast cancer subtypes. Among these genes, we
identified: BAX (p = 0.0146), CYP2D6 (p = 0.0063), ERCC1 (p = 0.0231), FOXC1 (p =
0.0048), IRF1 (p = 0.0022), MAP2 (p = 0.0011), and MKI67 (p = 0.0332). The
assessment of core biopsy gene profiles and receptor-based subtypes, before
neoadjuvant therapy seems to predict response or resistance and to define new
signaling pathways to provide more powerful classifiers in breast cancer, hence
the need for further research.

Type 1 IFN-independent activation of a subset of interferon stimulated genes in
West Nile virus Eg101-infected mouse cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302, USA.

Although infection of mouse embryofibroblasts (MEFs) with WNV Eg101 induced
interferon (IFN) beta production and STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, these
transcription factors (TFs) were not detected in the nucleus or on the promoters 
of four IRF-3-independent interferon stimulated genes (ISGs): Oas1a and Irf7
(previously characterized as IFN/ISGF3-dependent), Oas1b and Irf1. These ISGs
were upregulated in WNV Eg101-infected STAT1-/-, STAT2-/-, and IFN alpha/beta
receptor-/- MEFs. Although either IRF-3 or IRF-7 could amplify/sustain Oas1a and 
Oas1b upregulation at later times after infection, these factors were not
required for the initial gene activation. The lack of upregulation of these ISGs 
in WNV Eg101-infected IRF-3/9-/- MEFs suggested the involvement of IRF-9.
Activation of Irf1 in infected MEFs did not depend on any of these IRFs. The data
indicate that additional alternative activation mechanisms exist for subsets of
ISGs when a virus infection has blocked ISG activation by the canonical
IFN-mediated pathway.

The Role of Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF1) in Overcoming Antiestrogen
Resistance in the Treatment of Breast Cancer.

Resistance to endocrine therapy is common among breast cancer patients with
estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER+) tumors and limits the success of this
therapeutic strategy. While the mechanisms that regulate endocrine responsiveness
and cell fate are not fully understood, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) is 
strongly implicated as a key regulatory node in the underlying signaling network.
IRF1 is a tumor suppressor that mediates cell fate by facilitating apoptosis and 
can do so with or without functional p53. Expression of IRF1 is downregulated in 
endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, protecting these cells from IRF1-induced
inhibition of proliferation and/or induction of cell death. Nonetheless, when
IRF1 expression is induced following IFN<U+03B3> treatment, antiestrogen sensitivity is 
restored by a process that includes the inhibition of prosurvival BCL2 family
members and caspase activation. These data suggest that a combination of
endocrine therapy and compounds that effectively induce IRF1 expression may be
useful for the treatment of many ER+ breast cancers. By understanding IRF1
signaling in the context of endocrine responsiveness, we may be able to develop
novel therapeutic strategies and better predict how patients will respond to
endocrine therapy.

LPS regulates SOCS2 transcription in a type I interferon dependent

Recent studies suggest that SOCS2 is involved in the regulation of TLR signaling.
In this study, we found that the expression of SOCS2 is regulated in human
monocyte-derived DC by ligands stimulating TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 signaling.
SOCS2 induction by LPS was dependent on the type I IFN regulated transcription
factors IRF1 and IRF3 as shown by using silencing RNAs for IRFs. Blocking
endogenous type I IFN signaling, by neutralizing antibodies to the receptor
IFNAR2, abolished SOCS2 mRNA expression after TLR4 stimulation. Transcription
factors STAT3, 5 and 6 displayed putative binding sites in the promoter regions
of the human SOCS2 gene. Subsequent silencing experiments further supported that 
STAT3 and STAT5 are involved in LPS induced SOCS2 regulation. In mice we show
that SOCS2 mRNA induction is 45% lower in bone marrow derived macrophages derived
from MyD88(-/-) mice, and do not increase in BMMs from IRF3(-/-) mice after BCG
infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that TLR4 signaling indirectly
increases SOCS2 in late phase mainly via the production of endogenous type I IFN,
and that subsequent IFN receptor signaling activates SOCS2 via STAT3 and STAT5.

In utero priming to malaria antigens renders cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) 
more susceptible to productive HIV infection in vitro in the absence of exogenous
stimulation. This provides a unique model to better understand mechanisms
affecting lymphocyte susceptibility to HIV infection in vivo. Effector memory
CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells (T(EM)) were the exclusive initial targets of HIV with rapid
spread to central memory cells. HIV susceptibility correlated with increased
expression of CD25 and HLA-DR on T(EM). Virus entered all samples equally,
however gag/pol RNA was only detected in HIV susceptible samples, suggesting
regulation of proviral gene transcription. Targeted analysis of human genes in
memory T cells showed greater expression of IFNG, NFATc1, IRF1, FOS, and PPIA and
decreased expression YY1 and TFCP2 in HIV susceptible samples. Thus fetal priming
to exogenous antigens enhances specific proviral gene transcription pathways in
effector memory cells that may increase risk of vertical transmission of HIV.

Although neurological sequelae are attributable to poor regeneration of the
central nervous system, oligodendrocytes demonstrate robust regenerative response
even in adults. Accumulating evidence indicates that the glial cells identified
by surface expression of the proteoglycan NG2 are the cellular source of
newly-developed oligodendrocytes following demyelination, and thereby considered 
adult oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs). Despite their robust regenerative
capability, remyelination often ends up in failure or is incomplete, particularly
after recurrent neuroinflammation, which is referred to as "remyelination
failure". While axonal degeneration may contribute to remyelination failure, OPCs
are also affected by neuroinflammation. Indeed, various studies have indicated
that gamma-interferon, a proinflammatory cytokine associated with autoimmunity,
is cytotoxic to OPCs by inducing cell death, and inhibiting their proliferation
and differentiation. In contrast to gamma-interferon, we confirmed that
beta-interferon which is used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis does not induce OPC death. Through a comprehensive analysis of
gamma-interferon-inducible and beta-interferon-inducible genes in OPCs, we have
identified interferon regulatory factor-1 and -8 (IRF1 and IRF8) as candidate
transcription factors responsible for gamma-interferon-mediated cytotoxicity in
OPCs. Validating and elaborating on these findings particularly in in vivo models
may prove of importance in understanding remyelination failure and suggest
therapeutic approaches to enhance remyelination.

Sepsis-induced lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis contributes to
immunosuppression, which results in an inability to eradicate the primary
infection as well as a propensity to acquire new, secondary infections. Another
cellular process, autophagy, is also activated in immune cells and plays a
protective role. In the present study, we demonstrate that interferon regulatory 
factor 1 (IRF-1) regulates both immune cell apoptosis and autophagy in a murine
endotoxemia model. Interferon regulatory factor 1 is activated at an early phase 
through a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent, myeloid differentiation primary
response gene 88-independent manner in splenocytes. Furthermore, IRF-1 knockout
(KO) mice are protected from a lethal endotoxemia model. This protection is
associated with decreased apoptosis and increased autophagy in splenocytes.
Interferon regulatory factor 1 KO mice experience decreased apoptotic cell loss, 
especially in CD4<U+207A> T lymphocytes and myeloid antigen-presenting cells. Meanwhile,
IRF-1 KO mice demonstrate increased autophagy and improved mitochondrial
integrity. This increased autophagy in KO mice is attributable, at least in part,
to deactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin/P70S6 signaling--a main negative
regulator of autophagy. Therefore, we propose a novel role for IRF-1 in
regulating both apoptosis and autophagy in splenocytes in the setting of
endotoxemia with IRF-1 promoting apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy.

Contribution of a TANK-binding kinase 1-interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7
pathway to IFN-<U+03B3>-induced gene expression.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs) share common target genes. Here we show that the Irf7
gene is regulated by transcription factors STAT1 and IRF9 in response to the type
II interferon (IFN) IFN-<U+03B3>. IRF7 cooperated with STAT1 and IRF1 to stimulate the
expression of a subset of IFN-<U+03B3>-induced STAT1 target genes. IRF7-mediated control
of the Gbp2 gene required the presence and basal activity of the S/T kinase
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), whereas the binding of IRF7 to the Gbp2 promoter
did not. Analysis of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment to the Gbp2 promoter 
revealed a role for IRF7 at later stages of the IFN-<U+03B3> response. In support of the
role of IRF7 in establishing an effective antibacterial response,
IFN-<U+03B3>-pretreated Irf7(-/-) macrophages showed an increased bacterial burden after
infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Our data thus describe a biologically
relevant basal activity of TBK1 and identify IRF7 as a novel player in the IFN-<U+03B3> 
response.

Knockdown of menin affects pre-mRNA processing and promoter fidelity at the
interferon-gamma inducible IRF1 gene.

BACKGROUND: The tumor suppressor menin (MEN1) is mutated in the inherited disease
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I, and has several documented cellular roles,
including the activation and repression of transcription effected by several
transcription factors. As an activator, MEN1 is a component of the Set1-like
mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) MLL1/MLL2 methyltransferase complex that methylates 
histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). MEN1 is localized to the signal transducer and
activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-dependent gene, interferon regulatory factor
1 (IRF1), and is further recruited when IRF1 transcription is triggered by
interferon-<U+03B3> signaling.
RESULTS: RNAi-mediated knockdown of MEN1 alters the H3K4 dimethylation and H3
acetylation profiles, and the localization of histone deacetylase 3, at IRF1.
While MEN1 knockdown does not impact the rate of transcription, IRF1
heteronuclear transcripts become enriched in MEN1-depleted cells. The processed
mRNA and translated protein product are concomitantly reduced, and the antiviral 
state is attenuated. Additionally, the transcription start site at the IRF1
promoter is disrupted in the MEN1-depleted cells. The H3K4 demethylase, lysine
specific demethylase 1, is also associated with IRF1, and its inhibition alters
H3K4 methylation and disrupts the transcription start site as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data indicate that MEN1 contributes to
STAT1-activated gene expression in a novel manner that includes defining the
transcription start site and RNA processing.

Treg cells maintain the tumor microenvironment in an immunosuppressive state
preventing an effective anti-tumor immune response. A possible strategy to
overcome Treg-cell suppression focuses on OX40, a costimulatory molecule
expressed constitutively by Treg cells while being induced in activated effector 
T cells. OX40 stimulation, by the agonist mAb OX86, inhibits Treg-cell
suppression and boosts effector T-cell activation. Here we uncover the mechanisms
underlying the therapeutic activity of OX86 treatment dissecting its distinct
effects on Treg and on effector memory T (Tem) cells, the most abundant CD4+
populations strongly expressing OX40 at the tumor site. In response to OX86,
tumor-infiltrating Treg cells produced significantly less interleukin 10 (IL-10),
possibly in relation to a decrease in the transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Tem cells responded to OX86 by upregulating surface
CD40L expression, providing a licensing signal to DCs. The CD40L/CD40 axis was
required for Tem-cell-mediated in vitro DC maturation and in vivo DC migration.
Accordingly, OX86 treatment was no longer therapeutic in CD40 KO mice. In
conclusion, following OX40 stimulation, blockade of Treg-cell suppression and
enhancement of the Tem-cell adjuvant effect both concurred to free DCs from
immunosuppression and activate the immune response against the tumor.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a highly effective immunosuppressant that has broad
antiviral activity against different viruses and can act in synergy with
interferon-a (IFN-a) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. MPA is a potent
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor but the antiviral
mechanisms are less understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the
inhibition of HCV infection by MPA and the molecular basis for its synergy with
IFN-a. The role of IMPDH and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was investigated 
in two HCV models using gain- or loss-of-function approaches. The in vivo effect 
of MPA treatment was studied in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with HCV replicon cells. 
Potent antiviral effects of MPA at clinically relevant concentrations were
observed with both the subgenomic and JFH1-derived infectious HCV models. MPA
treatment in mice resulted in a specific and robust inhibition of HCV
replication. Ectopic expression of an MPA-resistant IMPDH2 mutant in HCV host
cells completely reversed the antiproliferative effect of MPA but only partially 
affected the antiviral potency. However, similar to ribavirin, MPA induced
expression of multiple antiviral ISGs, including interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1). Cotreatment of MPA with IFN-a resulted in additive effects on ISG
expression and enhanced IFN-induced luciferase reporter activity. Knockdown of
IRF1, but not IFITM3, significantly attenuated the inhibition of HCV replication 
by MPA.CONCLUSION: MPA exerts a potent anti-HCV effect in vitro and in mice and
acts in synergy with IFN-a. MPA's antiviral activity partially depends on IMPDH
but also involves stimulation of ISGs, providing a molecular basis for its
synergy with IFN-a.

Hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) is accompanied by excessive
reactive oxygen species and resultant sterile inflammation. Chlorogenic acid
(CGA), one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet, has been shown to 
exert potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Thus,
the purpose of the present study was to investigate protective effects of CGA and
its molecular mechanisms against hepatic I/R injury. Rats were subjected to 60
min of partial hepatic ischemia followed by 5 h of reperfusion. CGA (2.5, 5 and
10 mg/kg, ip) was administered twice: 10 min prior to ischemia and 10 min before 
reperfusion. CGA treatment resulted in marked improvement of hepatic function and
histology, and suppressed oxidative stress, as indicated by hepatic lipid
peroxidation and glutathione level. Levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-a,
inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expressions
were up-regulated after I/R; these effects were attenuated by CGA. Immunoblot
results showed that CGA reduced I/R-induced toll-like receptor 4 overexpression, 
nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B and interferon regulatory
factor-1, high-mobility group box-1 release into extracellular milieu, and
enhanced heme oxygenase-1 expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2. Our results suggest that CGA alleviates I/R-induced
liver injury and that this protection is likely due to inhibition of inflammatory
response and enhancement of antioxidant defense systems. Therefore, CGA might
have potential as an agent for use in clinical treatment of hepatic I/R injury.

Putting the brakes on mammary tumorigenesis: loss of STAT1 predisposes to
intraepithelial neoplasias.

Multiparous Stat1-/- mice spontaneously develop mammary tumors with increased
incidence: at an average age of 12 months, 55% of the animals suffer from mammary
cancer, although the histopathology is heterogeneous. We consistently observed
mosaic expression or down-regulation of STAT1 protein in wild-type mammary cancer
evolving in the control group. Transplantation experiments show that
tumorigenesis in Stat1-/- mice is partially influenced by impaired CTL mediated
tumor surveillance. Additionally, STAT1 exerts an intrinsic tumor suppressing
role by controlling and blocking proliferation of the mammary epithelium. Loss of
STAT1 in epithelial cells enhances cell growth in both transformed and primary
cells. The increased proliferative capacity leads to the loss of structured acini
formation in 3D-cultures. Analogous effects were observed when Irf1-/- epithelial
cells were used. Accordingly, the rate of mammary intraepithelial neoplasias
(MINs) is increased in Stat1-/- animals: MINs represent the first step towards
mammary tumors. The experiments characterize STAT1/IRF1 as a key growth
inhibitory and tumor suppressive signaling pathway that prevents mammary cancer
formation by maintaining growth control. Furthermore, they define the loss of
STAT1 as a predisposing event via enhanced MIN formation.

Regulation of human formyl peptide receptor 1 synthesis: role of single
nucleotide polymorphisms, transcription factors, and inflammatory mediators.

States of America. heini@montana.edu

The gene encoding the human formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is heterogeneous,
containing numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we examine the 
effect of these SNPs on gene transcription and protein translation. We also
identify gene promoter sequences and putative FPR1 transcription factors. To test
the effect of codon bias and codon pair bias on FPR1 expression, four FPR1
genetic variants were expressed in human myeloid U937 cells fused to a reporter
gene encoding firefly luciferase. No significant differences in luciferase
activity were detected, suggesting that the translational regulation and protein 
stability of FPR1 are modulated by factors other than the SNP codon bias and the 
variant amino acid properties. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis of the FPR1
promoter showed that a CCAAT box is not required for gene transcription. A -88/41
promoter construct resulted in the strongest transcriptional activity, whereas a 
-72/41 construct showed large reduction in activity. The region between -88 and
-72 contains a consensus binding site for the transcription factor PU.1.
Mutagenesis of this site caused significant reduction in reporter gene
expression. The PU.1 binding was confirmed in vivo by chromatin
immunoprecipitation, and the binding to nucleotides -84 to -76 (TTCCTATTT) was
confirmed in vitro by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Thus, similar to
many other myeloid genes, FPR1 promoter activity requires PU.1. Two single
nucleotide polymorphisms at -56 and -54 did not significantly affect FPR1 gene
expression, despite differences in binding of transcription factor IRF1 in vitro.
Inflammatory mediators such as interferon-<U+03B3>, tumor necrosis factor-a, and
lipopolysaccharide did not increase FPR1 promoter activity in myeloid cells,
whereas differentiation induced by DMSO and retinoic acid enhanced the activity. 
This implies that the expression of FPR1 in myeloid cells is developmentally
regulated, and that the differentiated cells are equipped for immediate response 
to microbial infections.

I<U+03BA>B kinase epsilon (IKK(epsilon)) regulates the balance between type I and type
II interferon responses.

Virus infection induces the production of type I and type II interferons (IFN-I
and IFN-II), cytokines that mediate the antiviral response. IFN-I (IFN-a and
IFN-ß) induces the assembly of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), a multimeric
transcriptional activation complex composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IFN regulatory
factor 9. IFN-II (IFN-<U+03B3>) induces the homodimerization of STAT1 to form the
gamma-activated factor (GAF) complex. ISGF3 and GAF bind specifically to unique
regulatory DNA sequences located upstream of IFN-I- and IFN-II-inducible genes,
respectively, and activate the expression of distinct sets of antiviral genes.
The balance between type I and type II IFN pathways plays a critical role in
orchestrating the innate and adaptive immune systems. Here, we show that the
phosphorylation of STAT1 by I<U+03BA>B kinase epsilon (IKKe) inhibits STAT1
homodimerization, and thus assembly of GAF, but does not disrupt ISGF3 formation.
Therefore, virus and/or IFN-I activation of IKKe suppresses GAF-dependent
transcription and promotes ISGF3-dependent transcription. In the absence of IKKe,
GAF-dependent transcription is enhanced at the expense of ISGF3-mediated
transcription, rendering cells less resistant to infection. We conclude that IKKe
plays a critical role in regulating the balance between the IFN-I and IFN-II
signaling pathways.

SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signalling) proteins are negative-feedback
regulators of the JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and activator of
transcription) pathway. Their expression levels are low under physiological
conditions, but they are up-regulated in response to cytokine stimulation in many
immune and inflammatory processes. Overexpression of SOCS1 in keratinocyte clones
abrogates the IFN<U+03B3> (interferon <U+03B3>)-induced expression of many pro-inflammatory
genes and the release of related chemokines by blocking the JAK/STAT pathway.
SOCS1 inhibits JAK2 kinase activity by binding the catalytic site of JAK2, with
its KIR (kinase-inhibitory region) acting as a pseudo-substrate of the enzyme. In
the present study, we screened a focused combinatorial peptide library of KIR to 
identify new peptides able to mimic its function with an improved affinity
towards the JAK2 catalytic site. Using an alanine-scanning method, KIR residues
that are crucial for the interaction with JAK2 were unveiled. In this way, the
KIR sequence was restricted to a shorter segment and non-essential residues
were replaced by different amino acids following a simplified combinatorial
approach. We selected a new unnatural sequence able to bind to JAK2 with Kd
values in the nanomolar range. This peptide was tested in human keratinocyte
cultures and reduced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the expression levels of
IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor-1).

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular responses to cytokines and 
growth factors. Recent studies have identified a recurrent somatic activating
mutation (JAK2 V617F) in majority of patients with myeloproliferative disorders
(MPDs). Development of drugs that target JAK2 V617F is, therefore, of therapeutic
relevance. To discover small molecule inhibitors for this target, robust and
reliable cell-based assays are important. Here, we present a comparison of two
homogeneous, 384-well plate-based cellular assays using Invitrogen's CellSensor® 
JAK2 V617F interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf1)-beta-lactamase (bla) human
erythroleukemia line (HEL): (1) SureFire® pSTAT5 AlphaScreen® assay from
PerkinElmer; and (2) GeneBLAzer® fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay
from Invitrogen. HEL cells are growth factor-independent due to JAK2 V617F
mutation that causes constitutive STAT5 activation. The SureFire assay measures
levels of phosphorylated STAT5 downstream of JAKs, while the GeneBLAzer assay is 
a reporter assay that monitors bla activity further downstream of STAT5.
Evaluation of a number of chemically diverse JAK2 inhibitors in the two cellular 
assays yielded comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values,
boding well for the utility of these assay formats in compound profiling.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a complex process involving multiple
pathways downstream of the primary genetic insult leading to fatal muscle
degeneration. Aging muscle is a multifactorial neuromuscular process
characterized by impaired muscle regeneration leading to progressive atrophy. We 
hypothesized that these chronic atrophying situations may share specific myogenic
adaptative responses at transcriptional level according to tissue remodeling.
Muscle biopsies from four young DMD and four AGED subjects were referred to a
group of seven muscle biopsies from young subjects without any neuromuscular
disorder and explored through a dedicated expression microarray. We identified
528 differentially expressed genes (out of 2,745 analyzed), of which 328 could be
validated by an exhaustive meta-analysis of public microarray datasets referring 
to DMD and Aging in skeletal muscle. Among the 328 validated co-expressed genes, 
50% had the same expression profile in both groups and corresponded to
immune/fibrosis responses and mitochondrial metabolism. Generalizing these
observed meta-signatures with large compendia of public datasets reinforced our
results as they could be also identified in other pathological processes and in
diverse physiological conditions. Focusing on the common gene signatures in these
two atrophying conditions, we observed enrichment in motifs for candidate
transcription factors that may coordinate either the immune/fibrosis responses
(ETS1, IRF1, NF1) or the mitochondrial metabolism (ESRRA). Deregulation in their 
expression could be responsible, at least in part, for the same transcriptome
changes initiating the chronic muscle atrophy. This study suggests that distinct 
pathophysiological processes may share common gene responses and pathways related
to specific transcription factors.

apnea.

Comment in
    Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2012 Feb 1;185(3):243-5.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leads to multiple end-organ
morbidities that are mediated by the cumulative burden of oxidative stress and
inflammation. Because not all children with OSA exhibit increased systemic
inflammation, genetic and environmental factors may be affecting patterns of DNA 
methylation in genes subserving inflammatory functions.
METHODS: DNA from matched children with OSA with and without high levels of
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were assessed for DNA methylation
levels of 24 inflammatory-related genes. Primer-based polymerase chain reaction
assays in a case-control setting involving 47 OSA cases and 31 control subjects
were conducted to confirm the findings; hsCRP and myeloid-related protein (MRP)
8/14 levels were also assayed.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and interferon regulatory 
factor 1 (IRF1) showed higher methylation in six children with OSA and high hsCRP
levels compared with matched children with OSA and low hsCRP levels (P < 0.05).
In the case-control cohort, children with OSA and high CRP levels had higher log 
FOXP3 DNA methylation levels compared with children with OSA and low CRP levels
and control subjects. IRF1 did not exhibit significant differences. FOXP3 DNA
methylation levels correlated with hsCRP and MRP 8/14 levels and with
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), BMI z score, and apolipoprotein B levels. A stepwise 
multiple regression model showed that AHI was independently associated with FOXP3
DNA methylation levels (P < 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The FOXP3 gene, which regulates expression of T regulatory
lymphocytes, is more likely to display increased methylation among children with 
OSA who exhibit increased systemic inflammatory responses. Thus, epigenetic
modifications may constitute an important determinant of inflammatory phenotype
in OSA, and FOXP3 DNA methylation levels may provide a potential biomarker for
end-organ vulnerability.

The ubiquitin hydrolase USP22 contributes to 3'-end processing of
JAK-STAT-inducible genes.

Chipumuro E(1), Henriksen MA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, 
USA.

The JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription)
signaling pathway drives cellular growth, differentiation, and the immune
response. STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires
dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. We previously 
showed that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (ubH2B) is highly dynamic at the
STAT1 target gene, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), suggesting that a
deubiquitinase is recruited during gene activation. Here, we report that
RNAi-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitin hydrolase, USP22, results in 2-fold
higher ubH2B, and 2-fold lower transcriptional elongation at IRF1. We also
demonstrate that USP22 depletion diminishes 3'-end cleavage/polyadenylation by 2-
to 3-fold. Furthermore, the polyadenylation factor CPSF73 is not effectively
recruited, and serine 2 phosphorylation (Ser2P) of the C-terminal domain of RNA
polymerase II is also disrupted. The transcriptional and processing defects
observed in the USP22-knockdown cells are reversed by transient USP22
overexpression. Together, these results suggest that ubH2B helps recruit
polyadenylation factors to STAT1-activated genes. We propose a working model,
wherein a cycle of H2B ubiquitination/deubiquitination specifies Ser2P to
regulate elongation and 3'-end processing of JAK-STAT-inducible mRNAs. These
results further elaborate USP22 function and its role as a putative cancer stem
cell marker.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) is a pleiotropic cytokine with immunomodulatory,
anti-viral, and anti-proliferative effects. In this study, we examined the
effects of IFN-<U+03B3> on autophagy and cell growth in human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cells. IFN-<U+03B3> inhibited cell growth of Huh7 cells with non-apoptotic cell
death. IFN-<U+03B3> induced autophagosome formation and conversion/turnover of
microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein. Furthermore,
overexpression of IRF-1 also induced autophagy in Huh7 cells. Silencing IRF-1
expression with target small hairpin RNA blocked autophagy induced by IFN-<U+03B3>.
Silencing of the autophagy signals Beclin-1 or Atg5 attenuated the inhibitory
effect of IFN-<U+03B3> on Huh7 cells with decreased cell death. Additionally, IFN-<U+03B3>
activated autophagy in freshly cultured human HCC cells. Together, these findings
show that IFN-<U+03B3> induces autophagy through IRF-1 signaling pathway and the
induction of autophagy contributes to the growth-inhibitory effect of IFN-<U+03B3> with 
cell death in human liver cancer cells.

Loss of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) expression in human ductal
carcinoma correlates with disease stage and contributes to metastasis.

INTRODUCTION: New signaling pathways of the interleukin (IL) family, interferons 
(IFN) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) have recently been found within
tumor microenvironments and in metastatic sites. Some of these cytokines
stimulate while others inhibit breast cancer proliferation and/or invasion. IRFs,
a family of nine mammalian transcription factors, have multiple biologic
functions that when dysregulated may contribute to tumorigenesis; most well-known
are their roles in regulating/initiating host immunity. Some IRF family members
have been implicated in tumorigenesis yet little is still known of their
expression in primary human tumors or their role(s) in disease
development/progression. IRF5 is one of the newer family members to be studied
and has been shown to be a critical mediator of host immunity and the cellular
response to DNA damage. Here, we examined the expression of IRF5 in primary
breast tissue and determined how loss of expression may contribute to breast
cancer development and/or progression.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival breast tissue specimens from
patients with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) were examined for their expression of IRF1
and IRF5. Knockdown or overexpression of IRF5 in MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
mammary epithelial cell lines was used to examine the role of IRF5 in growth
inhibition, invasion and tumorigenesis.
RESULTS: Analysis of IRF expression in human breast tissues revealed the unique
down-regulation of IRF5 in patients with different grades of DCIS and IDC as
compared to IRF1; loss of IRF5 preceded that of IRF1 and correlated with
increased invasiveness. Overexpression of IRF5 in breast cancer cells inhibited
in vitro and in vivo cell growth and sensitized them to DNA damage. Complementary
experiments with IRF5 siRNAs made normal mammary epithelial cells resistant to
DNA damage. By 3-D culture, IRF5 overexpression reverted MDA-MB-231 to normal
acini-like structures; cells overexpressing IRF5 had decreased CXCR4 expression
and were insensitive to SDF-1/CXCL12-induced migration. These findings were
confirmed by CXCR4 promoter reporter assays.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF5 is an important tumor suppressor that regulates multiple
cellular processes involved in the conversion of normal mammary epithelial cells 
to tumor epithelial cells with metastatic potential.

A novel disrupter of telomere silencing 1-like (DOT1L) interaction is required
for signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-activated gene
expression.

Shah S(1), Henriksen MA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia

JAK-STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires
dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. Previously, we
showed that following IFN-<U+03B3> treatment, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 
(H3K79me3) is rapidly and highly induced in the 5'-end of the STAT1-dependent
gene interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), but the role of this histone
modification was unexplored. Here we report that DOT1L, the non-SET domain
containing methyltransferase that modifies Lys-79, is localized across IRF1 in
the uninduced state and is not further recruited by IFN-<U+03B3> induction.
RNAi-mediated depletion of DOT1L prevents the induction of H3K79me3 and lowers
the transcription of IRF1 2-fold, as expected. Surprisingly, STAT1 binding to its
DNA recognition element near the IRF1 promoter is diminished 2-fold in the
DOT1L-depleted cell line. In vivo and in vitro protein interaction assays reveal 
a DOT1L-STAT1 interaction. Domain mapping identifies the middle region of DOT1L
(amino acids 580-1183) as the STAT1 interaction domain. Overexpression of the
DOT1L STAT1 interaction domain represses IRF1 transcription (2-fold) and
interferes with STAT1 DNA binding at IRF1 and endogenous DOT1L histone
methyltransferase activity. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel STAT1-DOT1L
interaction that is required for the regulation JAK-STAT-inducible gene
expression.

CIITA is silenced by epigenetic mechanisms that prevent the recruitment of
transactivating factors in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

School of Medicine, Carbondale, IL, USA.

Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are highly malignant pediatric sarcomas. We have
discovered that the gene encoding the major histocompatibilty complex class II
transactivator, CIITA, is silenced in cells representing both major subtypes of
RMS. Silencing of CIITA prevents the IFN-<U+03B3> inducible expression of MHC class II
genes in these cells. Overexpression of CIITA in these cells can restore MHC
expression. We have found that IFN-<U+03B3> signaling is intact in these cells, but
pSTAT1 and IRF1 do not bind to the CIITA PIV promoter. The CIITA promoter is not 
hypermethylated in RD (ERMS) cells but does show a modestly enhanced methylation 
status in SJRH30 (ARMS) cells. We have found that histone acetylation, which
normally increases on the CIITA PIV promoter following IFN-<U+03B3> treatment, is
blocked in both types of RMS cells. In RD cells, treatment with a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (TSA) reverses the silencing of CIITA. In SJRH30 cells,
treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and TSA cooperatively restores
CIITA expression. Surprisingly, we have also shown that the expression of two
components of the immunoproteasome, which are embedded in the class II locus, is 
stimulated by IFN-<U+03B3> in certain RMS cells in the absence of stimulation by CIITA. 
CIITA overexpression can also activate the expression of these genes, indicating 
that the immunoproteasome genes LMP2 and LMP7 can be activated by both CIITA
dependent and CIITA independent pathways.

AIMS: In this study, the role of retinoic inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated
signalling in the inflammation of atherosclerosis was investigated to explain the
pathology of atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Human and mouse primary cells were exposed to
25-hydroxycholesterol followed by examination of gene expression and activation
of the signal pathway with biochemical and molecular biological techniques. A
mouse atherosclerotic model was also used. We found that RIG-I was induced in
macrophages and endothelium by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Interferon regulatory
factor 1 is a key transcription factor for the induction of RIG-I by
25-hydroxycholesterol. The induction of interleukin-8 and growth-regulated
protein a, the mouse interleukin-8 homologue, by 25-hydroxycholesterol is
mediated by RIG-I signalling. RIG-I transduces the signal to downstream
molecules, mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, transforming growth
factor-ß-activated kinase 1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to the
activation of nuclear factor <U+03BA>B, activator protein-1, and nuclear factor
interleukin-6, all of which are required for the expression of interleukin-8.
Finally, we observed that RIG-I is highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that RIG-I signalling mediates atherosclerotic
inflammation. Targeting RIG-I signalling should provide a way to inhibit
atherosclerotic inflammation, which holds potential for the therapy of
atherosclerosis.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is induced by
many tumor-suppressive stimuli and can mediate antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects in cancer cells. Thus, identifying agents that enhance IRF-1 activity may
be an effective approach to cancer therapy. A cell-based screening assay was
developed to identify extracts and compounds that could enhance IRF-1 activity,
using an IRF-1-dependent luciferase reporter cell line. Through this approach, we
identified a natural product extract and a known active component of this
extract, baicalein, which causes a marked increase in IRF-1-dependent reporter
gene expression and IRF-1 protein, with modulation of known IRF-1 targets PUMA
and cyclin D1. Baicalein causes suppression of growth in vitro in multiple cancer
cell lines in the low micromolar range. IRF-1 plays a role in this growth
suppression as shown by significant resistance to growth suppression in a breast 
cancer cell line stably transfected with short hairpin RNA against IRF-1.
Finally, intraperitoneal administration of baicalein by repeated injection causes
inhibition of growth in both xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models of cancer
without toxicity to the animals. These findings indicate that identifying
enhancers of IRF-1 activity may have utility in anticancer therapies and that
cell-based screening for activation of transcription factors can be a useful
approach for drug discovery.

epithelial cells cultures.

PURPOSE: One major consequence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell
activation during autoimmune uveitis is the induction of MHC II molecules
expression at their surface. IFN<U+03B3> is regarded as the main cytokine involved in
this induction. As TNFa plays a central role in autoimmune uveitis, we
investigated its effects on IFN<U+03B3>-mediated MHC II induction on RPE cells.
METHODS: Retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) were stimulated with IFN<U+03B3>,
TNFa and the anti-TNFa antibody infliximab. The expression of MHCII and ICAM-1
was analysed by flow cytometry. The activation and expression of IRF-1 and
STAT-1, two proteins involved in IFN<U+03B3>-signalling pathway, were analysed by WB.
Class II transactivator (CIITA) expression was monitored by qRT-PCR and
immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: TNFa inhibits IFN<U+03B3>-induced MHC II expression on ARPE cells in a
dose-dependent manner. Infliximab completely reverses the inhibitory effect of
TNFa. We did not observe an inhibitory effect of TNFa on the expression of ICAM-1
induced by IFN<U+03B3>. Similarly, IFN<U+03B3>-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1
expression were not affected by TNFa. On the contrary, we found that TNFa
suppresses IFN<U+03B3>-induced CIITA mRNA accumulation and protein expression.
CONCLUSION: TNFa inhibits IFN<U+03B3>-induced MHC II expression in RPE cells. This
inhibitory effect was reversed by infliximab and was not because of a global
inhibition of IFN<U+03B3> -mediated RPE cell activation but rather to a specific
down-regulation of CIITA expression. Those findings are consistent with the role 
of TNFa in the resolution of inflammation and might help to elucidate the complex
development of autoimmune uveitis.

OBJECTIVE: To study the differential microRNAs expression between patients with
essential hypertension and healthy controls.
METHODS: Whole blood from 15 hypertensive patients and 5 controls healthies were 
separated into plasma at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. MicroRNAs were harvested using 
kit, and stored at -80°C. MicroRNAs profiling were performed using Exiqon
microRCURY(TM) LNA microRNAs array, and were quantitative RT-PCR for the
differential microRNAs expression. In addition, we used a set of plasma samples
from 24 hypertensive patients and 22 healthy donors to independently validate the
expression of these signature microRNAs.
RESULTS: MicroRNAs expression profile was found to be differentially in the
essential hypertensive patients compared with the healthy donors. Of 1700
microRNAs detected on the microarray, 46 microRNAs were found to be
differentially expressed in the essential hypertensive patient, 27 microRNAs were
collected in Sanger microRNAs data-bank, the function of remaining 19 microRNAs
were unknown. In the 27 microRNAs, 9 microRNAs were up-regulated in the
hypertension patient samples, while 18 known microRNAs were down-regulated.
MiR-296-5p (Fold change 0.47, P = 0.013) and miR-133b (Fold change 0.57, P =
0.033) were consistently down-regulated in the patient plasma, whereas let-7e
(Fold change 1.62, P = 0.009) and hcmv-miR-UL112 (Fold change 2.72, P = 0.004),
one human cytomegalovirus encoded microRNAs, were up-regulated in the patient
samples. The microRNAs expression was independently validated using another
sample. We showed that MHC class I polypeptide-related chain B (MHC class I
polypeptide-related chain B, MICB) and Interferon regulatory factor 1 (Interferon
regulatory factor 1, IRF1) were functional targets of hcmv-miR-UL112 by
fluorescent reporter assays.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypertensive patients have distinct microRNAs expression
Profile. Hcmv-miR-UL112 may have important implications toward pathogenesis of
essential hypertension.

To identify genes that participate in the abortion process, normal pregnant uteri
were compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced abortion uteri. At day 6 of
pregnancy, mice were treated with LPS at various time points to induce an
abortion. Total RNAs were applied to a cDNA microarray to analyze genes with
altered expression. At the early stage (2 hours) of LPS-induced abortion,
upregulated genes were mainly composed of immune responsive genes, including
Ccl4, Ccl2, Cxcl13, Gbp3, Gbp2, Mx2, H2-Eb1, Irf1 and Ifi203. Genes related to
toll-like receptor signaling were also overexpressed. At late stages of abortion 
(12-24 hours), many genes were suppressed rather than activated, and these were
mainly related to the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, and anti-apoptosis.
Altered expression of several selected genes was confirmed by real time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that many known
genes were altered in the LPS-treated pregnant uterus, implying that the
molecular mechanisms of the genes involved in LPS-induced abortion are
complicated. Further analysis of this expression profile will help our
understanding of the pathophysiological basis for abortion.

IFN-<U+03B3> plays a critical role in tumor immunosurveillance by affecting either
immune cells or tumor cells; however, IFN-mediated effects on tumor elimination
are largely unknown. In this study, we showed that IFN regulatory factors (IRF)
modulated by IFNs up- and downregulated Noxa expression, a prodeath BH3 protein, 
in various cancer cells. Inhibition of Noxa expression using short hairpin RNA in
tumor cells leads to resistance against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor
elimination, in which IFN-<U+03B3> is known as a critical effecter in mice. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis in both CT26 cells and SP2/0 cells, sensitive and
resistant to LPS-induced tumor elimination, respectively, revealed that the
responsiveness of IRF1, 3, 4, and 7 in the Noxa promoter region in response to
IFN-<U+03B3> might be crucial in LPS-induced tumor elimination. IRF1, 3, and 7 were
upregulated by IFN-<U+03B3> and activated Noxa expression, leading to the death of Noxa 
wild-type baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells but not of Noxa-deficient BMK cells. In
contrast, IRF4 acts as a repressor for Noxa expression and inhibits cell death
induced by IRF1, 3, or 7. Therefore, although IFN-<U+03B3> alone are not able to induce 
cell death in tumor cells in vitro, Noxa induction by IFN-<U+03B3>, which is regulated
by the balance between its activators (IRF1, 3, and 7) and its repressor (IRF4), 
is crucial to increasing the susceptibility of tumor cells to immune
cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Inflammatory bowel disease 5 (IBD5) is a 250 kb haplotype on chromosome 5 that is
associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease in Europeans. The OCTN1 gene
is centrally located on IBD5 and encodes a transporter of the antioxidant
ergothioneine (ET). The 503F variant of OCTN1 is strongly associated with IBD5
and is a gain-of-function mutation that increases absorption of ET. Although 503F
has been implicated as the variant potentially responsible for Crohn's disease
susceptibility at IBD5, there is little evidence beyond statistical association
to support its role in disease causation. We hypothesize that 503F is a recent
adaptation in Europeans that swept to relatively high frequency and that disease 
association at IBD5 results not from 503F itself, but from one or more nearby
hitchhiking variants, in the genes IRF1 or IL5. To test for evidence of recent
positive selection on the 503F allele, we employed the iHS statistic, which was
significant in the European CEU HapMap population (P=0.0007) and European Human
Genome Diversity Panel populations (P=0.01). To evaluate the hypothesis of
disease-variant hitchhiking, we performed haplotype association tests on
high-density microarray data in a sample of 1,868 Crohn's disease cases and 5,550
controls. We found that 503F haplotypes with recombination breakpoints between
OCTN1 and IRF1 or IL5 were not associated with disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05,
P=0.21). In contrast, we observed strong disease association for 503F haplotypes 
with no recombination between these three genes (OR: 1.24, P=2.6×10(-8)), as
expected if the sweeping haplotype harbored one or more disease-causing mutations
in IRF1 or IL5. To further evaluate these disease-gene candidates, we obtained
expression data from lower gastrointestinal biopsies of healthy individuals and
Crohn's disease patients. We observed a 72% increase in gene expression of IRF1
among Crohn's disease patients (P=0.0006) and no significant difference in
expression of OCTN1. Collectively, these data indicate that the 503F variant has 
increased in frequency due to recent positive selection and that disease-causing 
variants in linkage disequilibrium with 503F have hitchhiked to relatively high
frequency, thus forming the IBD5 risk haplotype. Finally, our association results
and expression data support IRF1 as a strong candidate for Crohn's disease
causation.

The pathogenesis of recurrent aphthous ulceration (RAU) is unknown, although an
abnormal immune reaction appears to be involved. RAU may result from oral
epithelium damage caused by T cell-mediated immune response. To improve
understanding of the role of T cells in RAU, the present study analyzed. the
expression of T cell-related genes in oral ulcers from patients with RAU, as well
as in healthy non-keratinized oral mucosa from aphthae-free volunteers. Biopsies 
from RAU patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using Human Th1-Th2-Th3
RT(2) Profiler PCR Array and qRT-PCR that allowed to quantify the transcript
levels of 86 genes related to T cell activation. We found that cells present in
aphthous ulcers express a characteristic Th1-like gene profile. The majority of
genes up-regulated in aphthous lesions such as IFN-<U+03B3>, TNF, IL-15, IRF1, STAT-1
and STAT-4 were Th1-associated. Th2-realated genes were not overexpressed in RAU 
tissues, with the exception for CCR3. Th3- and Th17-related gene expression
patterns were not demonstrated in RAU. These findings clearly reveal that
aphthous ulcer formation is predominantly dependent on the activation of the
Th1-type immune response.

IRF1 is a transcription factor that participates in interferon signaling.
Previous studies of IRF1 binding have utilized in vitro assays. We used ChIP-seq 
in human monocytes to better define the recognition motif for IRF1. The newly
identified 18bp motif (RAAASNGAAAGTGAAASY) is a refinement of the 13bp IRF1 motif
commonly used. We utilized the 18bp consensus motif and identified 345 potential 
target genes. To compare the 18bp motif with the 13bp motif, we compared putative
gene targets. Only 56 potential gene targets were defined by both consensus
motifs. To compare biological effects of interferon on the 13bp and the 18bp
consensus targets, we mined expression data from cells exposed to interferons or 
transfected with IRF1. In all cases, the 18bp consensus motif was more strongly
associated with transcriptional responses than the 13bp motif. Therefore, the new
18bp consensus motif appears to have a greater association with biological
activities of IRF1.

The IRF-1 protein, a mammalian transcriptional factor encoded by a gene located
in 5q23-q31, has antioncogenic properties. Involved in regulation of
differentiation and proliferation, IRF-1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and is
inactivated by deletion of its one or more exons (exon skipping) in many
hematological malignancies, including acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). DNA samples, extracted from peripheral blood,
taken from 50 Kashmiri AML subjects, were analysed using the polymerase chain
reaction and compared with examples of age and gender matched healthy controls
from the same population. Three different exon regions (2, 3 and 4) of the IRF-1 
gene that were previously shown to be prone to deletion were selected for
amplification and analysis. Deletion was observed in 31(62%) out of 50 AML
patients (p=0.016). Exon 3 was most frequently deleted (58%), followed by exon 2 
(28%), while exon 4 was least affected (12%), providing insights into critical
roles in leukemogenesis. The number of deleted exons was variable, but single
exon deletions were more frequent (30%). Of interest, IRF-1 gene deletions were
not observed in 19 (38%) patients. In our study, the frequency of deletions of
these three exons was slightly higher than in an Indian population (52%), but
lower than in Sweden in Europe (95%). This study also explored the prevalence and
clinical profile of IRF-1 deletions in AML patients. Adults had a significantly
higher incidence than children (p=0.0168) and IRF-1 deletions were associated
with low Hb (p< 0.0001), high TLC (p=0.0033) and a low platelet count (p=0.0076).

Regulation of CCL2 expression by an upstream TALE homeodomain protein-binding
site that synergizes with the site created by the A-2578G SNP.

CC Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) is a potent chemoattractant produced by macrophages 
and activated astrocytes during periods of inflammation within the central
nervous system. Increased CCL2 expression is correlated with disease progression 
and severity, as observed in pulmonary tuberculosis, HCV-related liver disease,
and HIV-associated dementia. The CCL2 distal promoter contains an A/G
polymorphism at position -2578 and the homozygous -2578 G/G genotype is
associated with increased CCL2 production and inflammation. However, the
mechanisms that contribute to the phenotypic differences in CCL2 expression are
poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that the -2578 G polymorphism
creates a TALE homeodomain protein binding site (TALE binding site) for
PREP1/PBX2 transcription factors. In this study, we identified the presence of an
additional TALE binding site 22 bp upstream of the site created by the -2578 G
polymorphism and demonstrated the synergistic effects of the two sites on the
activation of the CCL2 promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays, we demonstrated increased binding of the TALE proteins PREP1 and PBX2 to 
the -2578 G allele, and binding of IRF1 to both the A and G alleles. The presence
of TALE binding sites that form inverted repeats within the -2578 G allele
results in increased transcriptional activation of the CCL2 distal promoter while
the presence of only the upstream TALE binding site within the -2578 A allele
exerts repression of promoter activity.

Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) arise from complex interactions between
genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Whole genome linkage scans and
association studies have established thyroglobulin (TG) as a major AITD
susceptibility gene. However, the causative TG variants and the pathogenic
mechanisms are unknown. Here, we describe a genetic/epigenetic mechanism by which
a newly identified TG promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant
predisposes to AITD. Sequencing analyses followed by case control and
family-based association studies identified an SNP (-1623A<U+2192>G) that was associated
with AITD in the Caucasian population (p = 0.006). We show that the nucleotide
substitution introduced by SNP (-1623A/G) modified a binding site for interferon 
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a major interferon-induced transcription factor.
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that IRF-1 binds to the 5'
TG promoter motif, and the transcription factor binding correlates with active
chromatin structure and is marked by enrichment of mono-methylated Lys-4 residue 
of histone H3, a signature of active transcriptional enhancers. Using reporter
mutations and siRNA approaches, we demonstrate that the disease-associated allele
(G) conferred increased TG promoter activity through IRF-1 binding. Finally,
treatment of thyroid cells with interferon a, a known trigger of AITD, increased 
TG promoter activity only when it interacted with the disease-associated variant 
through IRF-1 binding. These results reveal a new mechanism of interaction
between environmental (IFNa) and genetic (TG) factors to trigger AITD.

production.

The IFN-regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 modulate processes involved
in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus and lupus nephritis, but the contribution
of IRF4, which has multiple roles in innate and adaptive immunity, is unknown. To
determine a putative pathogenic role of IRF4 in lupus, we crossed Irf4-deficient 
mice with autoimmune C57BL/6-(Fas)lpr mice. IRF4 deficiency associated with
increased activation of antigen-presenting cells in C57BL/6-(Fas)lpr mice,
resulting in a massive increase in plasma levels of TNF and IL-12p40, suggesting 
that IRF4 suppresses cytokine release in these mice. Nevertheless, IRF4
deficiency completely protected these mice from glomerulonephritis and lung
disease. The mice were hypogammaglobulinemic and lacked antinuclear and
anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, revealing the requirement of IRF4 for the maturation
of plasma cells. As a consequence, Irf4-deficient C57BL/6-(Fas)lpr mice neither
developed immune complex disease nor glomerular activation of complement. In
addition, lack of IRF4 impaired the maturation of Th17 effector T cells and
reduced plasma levels of IL-17 and IL-21, which are cytokines known to contribute
to autoimmune tissue injury. In summary, IRF4 deficiency enhances systemic
inflammation and the activation of antigen-presenting cells but also prevents the
maturation of plasma cells and effector T cells. Because these adaptive immune
effectors are essential for the evolution of lupus nephritis, we conclude that
IRF4 promotes the development of lupus nephritis despite suppressing
antigen-presenting cells.

Anemia of chronic disease is a complication accompanying many inflammatory
diseases. The proinflammatory cytokine IFN-<U+03B3> has been implicated in this form of 
anemia, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we describe a novel
mouse model for anemia of chronic disease, in which enhanced CD27-mediated
costimulation strongly increases the formation of IFN-<U+03B3>-producing effector T
cells, leading to a progressive anemia. We demonstrate that the anemia in these
mice is fully dependent on IFN-<U+03B3> and that this cytokine reduces both the life
span and the formation of red blood cells. Molecular analysis revealed that IFN-<U+03B3>
induces expression of the transcription factors of interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) and PU.1 in both murine and human erythroid precursors. We found that, on
IFN-<U+03B3> stimulation, IRF-1 binds to the promoter of SPI.1 (PU.1) and induces PU.1
expression, leading to inhibition of erythropoiesis. Notably, down-regulation of 
either IRF-1 or PU.1 expression is sufficient to overcome IFN-<U+03B3>-induced
inhibition of erythropoiesis. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism by
which chronic exposure to IFN-<U+03B3> induces anemia.

Recently we described a co-culture model of periodontal ligament (PDL)
fibroblasts and SCC-25 lingual squamous carcinoma cells, which resulted in
conversion of normal fibroblasts into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs),
and in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SCC-25 cells. We have found a
constitutive high interleukin-1ß (IL1-ß) expression in SCC-25 cells in normal and
in co-cultured conditions. In our hypothesis a constitutive IL1-ß expression in
SCC-25 regulates gene expression in fibroblasts during co-culture. Co-cultures
were performed between PDL fibroblasts and SCC-25 cells with and without
dexamethasone (DEX) treatment; IL1-ß processing was investigated in SCC-25 cells,
tumor cells and PDL fibroblasts were treated with IL1-ß. IL1-ß signaling was
investigated by western blot and immunocytochemistry. IL1-ß-regulated genes were 
analyzed by real-time qPCR. SCC-25 cells produced 16kD active IL1-ß, its receptor
was upregulated in PDL fibroblasts during co-culture, which induced
phosphorylation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), and
nuclear translocalization of NF<U+03BA>Ba. Several genes, including interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide
synthase 2 (COX-2) were induced in CAFs during co-culture. The most enhanced
induction was found for IL-6 and COX-2. Treatment of PDL fibroblasts with IL1-ß
reproduced a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of IL1-receptor, IL-6 and
COX-2. A further proof was achieved by DEX inhibition for IL1-ß-stimulated IL-6
and COX-2 gene expression. Constitutive expression of IL1-ß in the tumor cells
leads to IL1-ß-stimulated gene expression changes in tumor-associated
fibroblasts, which are involved in tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: An association study between single nucleotide polymorphism markers
(SNP) and (innate and adaptive) immune parameters but also feather condition
score on the back, rump and belly of laying hens was performed. The immune
parameters measured in blood samples were natural and acquired antibody titers
and complement activity. Feather condition score as a measure of feather damage
was determined, this parameter is closely related to feather pecking behavior in 
hens housed in groups.The aim of the study was to detect associations between
genetic markers and immune parameters and feather condition score across nine
lines of laying hens, focusing on the feather peckers as well as on the victims
of feather pecking.
METHODS: A novel approach based on across-line analysis and testing of the
SNP-by-line interaction was performed.
RESULTS: In total 59 significant associations between SNP and immune traits were 
detected. Previously identified QTL were confirmed and new associations of genes 
regulating immune function identified. The IL17A gene (chromosome 3) influences
natural and acquired antibody titers and activation of classical and alternative 
complement pathways. The major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 16 showed
significant association with natural and acquired antibody titers and classical
complement activity. The IL12B and IRF1 genes on chromosome 13 were associated
with natural antibody titers.The direct effect of the genotype of an individual
on its feather condition and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage
mates on the individual's feather condition were analyzed. The direct genetic
effect can be described as the susceptibility to be pecked at, and the
associative genetic effect as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Eleven
significant associations were detected for the direct effect, and 81 for the
associative effect. The serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) on chromosome 4 was
highlighted in both analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed previously identified QTL and identified new
associations of genes regulating immune function. The results for feather
condition score supports existing evidence of involvement of the serotonergic
system in feather pecking in laying hens. Immune regulatory genes were found to
be associated to feather condition score, revealing relationships between the
immune system and behavior.

Tumor stroma reaction-related gene signature predicts clinical outcome in human
hepatocellular carcinoma.

University, Shanghai, China.

The tumor stroma is a source of many potential new tumor biomarkers, in which the
immune response is of major importance. Little is known regarding how changes in 
stromal gene expression affect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. We
analyzed the expression of 28 stroma-related genes using quantitative RT-PCR in
122 HCC samples, and related the results to patient prognosis. Hierarchical
clustering based on expression of the 28 genes, or the 6-Th1 cell markers, can
classify HCC patients into prognostically different subgroups. We further
identified a five-gene classifier (protective genes IRF1 and GZMB and risk genes 
CRTH2, VEGF, and MMP7) as a significant independent prognosticator for recurrence
(hazard ratio [HR], 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.31-9.96; P = 2.6 ×
10(-5) ) by multivariate analyses. Importantly, the classifier was further
validated in an independent set of 172 HCC samples (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.20-3.00; 
P = 0.002). The predictive ability of the classifier, as measured by area under
the curve (0.713 and 0.613 for original and validation cohorts, respectively),
was comparable to those of vascular invasion, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
stage, and TNM stage. The densities of various tumor stromal cells were analyzed 
by immunostaining. Comparing the immunostaining and gene expression data showed
significant association of the gene classifier with the amount of reactive stroma
in both cohorts. Thus, the signature reveals the strong prognostic capacity of
immune responses, angiogenic activity, and ECM remodeling, highlighting the
importance of stromal biology in HCC progression. Contained in this novel
predictor may be targets suitable for new therapeutic interventions, or for use
as independent prognosticators.

Investigation of helper T cell markers in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines
demonstrated that HuT-102 has an IL-9-producing Th17 phenotype. We confirmed the 
vital role of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C, a Th17 transcription
factor, in the expression of IL-17. Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a
transcription factor overexpressed in all HTLV-1-infected cells, regulated IL-17 
and IL-9 concomitantly. We further demonstrated a novel pathway for the
regulation of Tax-induced cytokines, IL-9 and IL-6, through TAK1-mediated nuclear
accumulation of c-Rel. A microarray analysis for IRF4 knocked down HuT-102 cells 
showed a significant up-regulation in the set of genes related to Th1, mainly
IFN-<U+03B3> and several transcription factors. T-bet and IRF1, but not STAT1 and IRF9, 
participated in counteracting the inhibitory effect of IRF4 on the production of 
IFN-<U+03B3>. Finally, suppression of both IRF4 and c-Rel resulted in the reduced
proliferation. Collectively, these findings indicate that TAK1-c-Rel and IRF4
pathways play distinct roles in the maintenance of IL-9-producing Th17 phenotype 
of HTLV-1-transformed cells.

The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens.
The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been
identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been
characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little
is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their
mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show
that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each
viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together
encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 
human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several
important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever
virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, 
C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also
known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was
observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as
PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of
pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type
I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational
inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and
MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer
of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.

vascular endothelial cells.

Thalidomide is known as an anti-angiogenic, anti-tumor, and anti-proliferative
agent, widely used in the treatment of some immunological disorders and cancers. 
The effect of thalidomide on interferon (IFN)-<U+03B3> induced nitric oxide (NO)
production in mouse vascular endothelial cells was examined in order to elucidate
the anti-angiogenic or anti-inflammatory action. Thalidomide inhibited
IFN-<U+03B3>-induced NO production in mouse END-D cells via reduced expression of an
inducible type of NO synthase (iNOS) protein and mRNA. Since thalidomide did not 
alter the cell surface expression of IFN-<U+03B3> receptor, the NO inhibition was
suggested to be due to the impairment of IFN-<U+03B3>-induced intracellular event by
thalidomide. Thalidomide inhibited the phosphorylation of IRF1, which was
required for the iNOS expression. Moreover, it inhibited the phosphorylation of
STAT1, an upstream molecule of IRF1, in IFN-<U+03B3> signaling. Thalidomide did not
inhibit the JAK activation in response to IFN-<U+03B3>. A phosphatase inhibitor, sodium 
orthovanadate, abolished the inhibitory action of thalidomide. Therefore,
thalidomide was suggested to inhibit IFN-<U+03B3>-induced NO production via impaired
STAT1 phosphorylation.

[Genetic susceptibility to virus associated encephalitis or encephalopathy].

There has been rapid progress in the understanding of the protective mechanism
against infection during the past decade. We reviewed the genetic susceptibility 
in familial or recurrent encephalitis/encephalopathy and subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE). Recessive mutation of UNC-93B1 and dominant mutation of
TLR3 were associated with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). Those mutations
impair the dsRNA-induced IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-lambda production and predispose 
to HSE. Dominant mutation of RANBP2 (encoding a nuclear pore protein) was
detected in familial or recurrent patients with acute necrotizing encephalopathy.
Polymorphisms of MxA, IL-4, IRF1, TLR3, PD1 and TLR3 are probably associated with
the development of SSPE. Identification of causing or predisposing genes would
enable the early diagnosis and the establishment of effective protection or
treatment.

vitro with West Nile virus.

West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne, single-stranded RNA flavivirus, causes
significant human morbidity and mortality in the older population; thus, we
investigated the effects of aging on infection with WNV in dendritic cells (DCs).
We infected DCs with WNV in vitro and quantified cytokines and chemokines (type I
IFN and CXCL10), pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I, and Toll-like receptors 3 
and 7. The production of type I IFN was significantly lower in DCs from older
donors, compared with younger donors. Although we observed no significant
age-related difference in expression or nuclear translocation of signaling
molecules in initial antiviral responses, DCs from older donors have diminished
induction of late-phase responses (eg, STAT1, IRF7, and IRF1), suggesting
defective regulation of type I IFN. Our results identify deficits in critical
regulatory pathways in the antiviral response that may contribute to the enhanced
susceptibility to viral infections observed in aging.

Crucial steps in high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-related carcinogenesis
are the integration of HR-HPV into the host genome and loss of viral episomes.
The mechanisms that promote cervical neoplastic progression are, however, not
clearly understood. During HR-HPV infection, the HPV E5 protein is expressed in
precancerous stages but not after viral integration. Given that it has been
reported that loss of HPV16 episomes and cervical tumor progression are
associated with increased expression of antiviral genes that are inducible by
type I interferon (IFN), we asked whether E5, expressed in early phases of
cervical carcinogenesis, affects IFN-ß signaling. We show that the HPV type 16
(HPV16) E5 protein expression per se stimulates IFN-ß expression. This
stimulation is specifically mediated by the induction of interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1) which, in turn, induces transcriptional activation of
IRF-1-targeted interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) as double-stranded
RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and caspase 8. Our data show a new and
unexpected role for HR-HPV E5 protein and indicate that HPV16 E5 may contribute
to the mechanisms responsible for cervical carcinogenesis in part via stimulation
of IFN-ß and an IFN signature, with IRF-1 playing a pivotal role. HPV16 E5 and
IRF-1 may thus serve as potential therapeutic targets in HPV-associated
premalignant lesions.

The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
signaling pathway is widely involved in cell migration, apoptosis and
inflammation. However, its exact mechanisms in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP)
remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the activity of the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway in pancreatic injury, investigate the functional mechanisms of 
SAP in vitro, and thus elucidate the underlying therapeutic effects for SAP
in vivo. The activation of the JAK-1/STAT-1 signaling pathway and the expessions 
of TNF-a, IL-1ß and IL-6 proteins were investigated in AR42J cells induced with
cerulein and treated with either PBS, RPM, or AG490. One group of cells was left 
untreated as a control group. Subsequently the activity of NF-<U+03BA>B was evaluated.
Rats were given RPM or AG490 just before the induction of SAP, the severity of
which was assessed at 24 h. The findings revealed that the up-regulated
expressions of JAK-1/STAT-1, STAT-3 protein were closely correlated with the
transcription of TNF-a, IL-1ß, and IL-6 in cerulein-stimulated cells.
Administration of RPM or AG490 decreased the activity of NF-<U+03BA>B and inhibited the 
release of TNF-a, IL-1ß, and IL-6. The reflective markers of severity of SAP were
also decreased by RPM or AG490 treatment compared to SAP rats. This study
indicates that the JAK-1/STAT-1 signaling pathway activity is an early event in
pancreatic inflammatory injury. Therefore, early treatment with its inhibitors
might be beneficial for attenuation of pancreatic injury in SAP.

p21(WAF1) is component of a positive feedback loop that maintains the p53
transcriptional program.

Author information: 
(1)CRUK Cell Signalling Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine,

The regulation of p53 activity through the MDM2 negative feedback loop is driven 
in part by an extrinsic ATM-pulse that maintains p53 oscillations in response to 
DNA damage. We report here that the p53 pathway has evolved an intrinsic positive
feedback loop that is maintained by the p53-inducible gene product p21(WAF1).
p21-null cancer cells have defects in p53 protein turnover, reductions in
MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, and reduced DNA damage-induced ubiquitination
of p53. TLR3-IRF1 or ATM-dependent signaling to p53 is defective in p21-null
cells and complementation of the p21 gene in p21-null cancer cells restores the
p53 transcriptional response. The mechanism of p53 inactivity in p21-null cells
is linked to a p53 protein equilibrium shift from chromatin into cytosolic
fractions and complementation of the p21 gene into p21-null cells restores the
nuclear localization of p53. A loss of p53 transcriptional function in murine
B-cells heterozygous or homozygous null for p21 highlights a p21-gene dosage
effect that maintains the full p53 transcriptional response. ATM inhibition
results in nuclear exclusion of p53 highlighting a positive genetic interaction
between ATM and p21. P21 protein oscillates in undamaged proliferating cells, and
reductions of p21 protein using siRNA eliminate the DNA damage-induced p53 pulse.
The p53 transcription program has evolved a negative feedback loop maintained by 
MDM2 that is counteracted by a positive feedback loop maintained by ATM-p21 the
balance of which controls the specific activity of p53 as a transcription factor.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune rheumatic disease
that is strongly influenced by genetic factors. Numerous genes are convincingly
associated with RA, including genes in tumor necrosis factor signaling (TNF) and 
the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B pathway. To date, except for genes within the HLA region,
no data exist regarding potential copy number variations (CNV) involving
RA-associated genes. We set out to identify genes affected by CNV that are
associated with RA at a genome-wide level.
METHODS: Data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) were used
in our analyses. The initial WTCCC cohort genotyped 3004 controls and 1999 RA
cases using the GeneChip 500k Mapping Array Set. We performed a comparative
intensity analysis using the PennCNV algorithm, which uses a hidden Markov model 
to detect CNV. A total of 2271 controls and 1572 RA samples passed quality
control criteria and were included for association analysis. Association analysis
was performed in 2 phases: (1) to identify CNV that are < 1 Mb with a population 
frequency < 5%; and (2) to identify large CNV that are > 1 Mb. Fishers' exact
test was performed to quantify significance of the CNV.
RESULTS: We observed that the genome-wide CNV burden is 2-fold higher in patients
with RA compared with controls. We identified 11 rare copy number variable
regions with < 5% frequency that had an association with RA that reached a p < 1 
× 10(-4). These include TNFAIP3 and TNIP1, which has been implicated in
association studies for RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis. We
identified CNV involving IRF1, which functions as a transcription activator of
genes induced by interferons; ALOX5AP and LCP2, involved in inflammatory
mediation; B2M, an MHC-class I associated gene; and PRKCH, a gene involved in T
cell signaling pathways. A 57 kb deletion with 1% frequency in RA cases at 7p21.3
was also observed. Six of these loci overlap with CNV catalogued in the Database 
of Genomic Variants.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to identify non-HLA RA-associated CNV using
genome-wide analyses. Validation and functional significance of these
deletions/duplications in RA and other autoimmune diseases need to be further
investigated.

ENCODE tiling array analysis identifies differentially expressed annotated and
novel 5' capped RNAs in hepatitis C infected liver.

States of America.

Microarray studies of chronic hepatitis C infection have provided valuable
information regarding the host response to viral infection. However, recent
studies of the human transcriptome indicate pervasive transcription in previously
unannotated regions of the genome and that many RNA transcripts have short or
lack 3' poly(A) ends. We hypothesized that using ENCODE tiling arrays (1% of the 
genome) in combination with affinity purifying Pol II RNAs by their unique 5'
m7GpppN cap would identify previously undescribed annotated and unannotated genes
that are differentially expressed in liver during hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection. Both 5'-capped and poly(A)+ populations of RNA were analyzed using
ENCODE tiling arrays. Sixty-four annotated genes were significantly increased in 
HCV cirrhotic as compared to control liver; twenty-seven (42%) of these genes
were identified only by analyzing 5' capped RNA. Thirty-one annotated genes were 
significantly decreased; sixteen (50%) of these were identified only by analyzing
5' capped RNA. Bioinformatic analysis showed that capped RNA produced more
consistent results, provided a more extensive expression profile of intronic
regions and identified upregulated Pol II transcriptionally active regions in
unannotated areas of the genome in HCV cirrhotic liver. Two of these regions were
verified by PCR and RACE analysis. qPCR analysis of liver biopsy specimens
demonstrated that these unannotated transcripts, as well as IRF1, TRIM22 and MET,
were also upregulated in hepatitis C with mild inflammation and no fibrosis. The 
analysis of 5' capped RNA in combination with ENCODE tiling arrays provides
additional gene expression information and identifies novel upregulated Pol II
transcripts not previously described in HCV infected liver. This approach,
particularly when combined with new RNA sequencing technologies, should also be
useful in further defining Pol II transcripts differentially regulated in
specific disease states and in studying RNAs regulated by changes in pre-mRNA
splicing or 3' polyadenylation status.

It is well known that aged or senescent cells develop a complex
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is observed both in
culture and in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of the SASP
are largely unknown. We demonstrate that retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)
is induced through the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-interferon regulatory factor
1 (ATM-IRF1) axis in senescent cells and that RIG-I signalling mediates the
expression of two important mediators of inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
IL-8. Klotho has been associated with ageing. We show here that the
intracellular, but not the secreted, form of klotho interacts with RIG-I and that
this interaction inhibits RIG-I-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 both in vitro
and in vivo. Our study uncovers a mechanism in which klotho functions as an
anti-ageing factor through the suppression of RIG-I-mediated inflammation.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor IRF4 is involved in several T-cell-dependent
chronic inflammatory diseases. To elucidate the mechanisms for pathological
cytokine production in colitis, we addressed the role of the IRF transcription
factors in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental colitis.
METHODS: IRF levels and cytokine production in IBD patients were studied as well 
as the effects of IRF4 deficiency in experimental colitis.
RESULTS: In contrast to IRF1, IRF5, and IRF8, IRF4 expression in IBD was
augmented in the presence of active inflammation. Furthermore, IRF4 levels
significantly correlated with IL-6 and IL-17 mRNA expression and to a lesser
extent with IL-22 mRNA expression in IBD. To further explore the role of IRF4
under in vivo conditions, we studied IRF4-deficient and wildtype mice in
experimental colitis. In contrast to DSS colitis, IRF4 deficiency was protective 
in T-cell-dependent transfer colitis associated with reduced RORa/<U+03B3>t levels and
impaired IL-6, IL-17a, and IL-22 production, suggesting that IRF4 acts as a
master regulator of mucosal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent mechanistic
studies using database analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a novel IRF4 binding site in the
IL-17 gene promoter. Overexpression of IRF4 using retroviral infection induced
IL-17 production and IL-17 together with IL-6 induced ROR<U+03B3>t expression.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF4 can directly bind to the IL-17 promotor and induces mucosal
ROR<U+03B3>t levels and IL-17 gene expression thereby controlling Th17-dependent
colitis. Targeting of this molecular mechanism may lead to novel therapeutic
approaches in human IBD.

The tumor microenvironment includes a complex network of immune T-cell
subpopulations. In this study, we systematically analyzed the balance between
cytotoxic T cells and different subsets of helper T cells in human colorectal
cancers and we correlated their impact on disease-free survival. A panel of
immune related genes were analyzed in 125 frozen colorectal tumor specimens.
Infiltrating cytotoxic T cells, Treg, Th1, and Th17 cells were also quantified in
the center and the invasive margin of the tumors. By hierarchical clustering of a
correlation matrix we identified functional clusters of genes associated with
Th17 (RORC, IL17A), Th2 (IL4, IL5, IL13), Th1 (Tbet, IRF1, IL12Rb2, STAT4), and
cytotoxicity (GNLY, GZMB, PRF1). Patients with high expression of the Th17
cluster had a poor prognosis, whereas patients with high expression of the Th1
cluster had prolonged disease-free survival. In contrast, none of the Th2
clusters were predictive of prognosis. Combined analysis of cytotoxic/Th1 and
Th17 clusters improved the ability to discriminate relapse. In situ analysis of
the density of IL17+ cells and CD8+ cells in tumor tissues confirmed the results.
Our findings argue that functional Th1 and Th17 clusters yield opposite effects
on patient survival in colorectal cancer, and they provide complementary
information that may improve prognosis.

AIM: It is reported that in salivary glands of Sjögren's syndrome (SS),
interferon gamma (IFN<U+03B3>) and IFN<U+03B3>-inducible genes containing signal transducers
and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) are upregulated and play a crucial role
in the pathogenesis of SS. The aim of this study is to clarify which
phosphorylation of STAT1, serine727 (Ser(727)) or tyrosine701 (Tyr(701)) of
STAT1, is important for IFN<U+03B3> signaling and IFN<U+03B3>-induced apoptosis in salivary
gland cells.
METHODS: We established STAT1 Tyr(701) variant (tyrosine to phenylalanine; Y701F)
and STAT1 Ser(727) variant (serine to alanine; S727A), which were transfected
into human salivary gland (HSG) cells. HSG cells transfected with these
mutant-STAT1 were analyzed on the expression of IFN<U+03B3>-inducible genes and
apoptosis after stimulation with IFN<U+03B3>.
RESULTS: In Y701F mutant-STAT1 transfected HSG cells (Ser(727)-dominant HSG
cells), IFN<U+03B3>-inducible genes such as IP10, IRF1, and Fas expression were
increased after stimulation with IFN<U+03B3>. In Ser(727)-dominant HSG cells, the
induction of apoptosis after stimulation with IFN<U+03B3> was also increased compared
with S727A mutant-STAT1 transfected HSG cells (Tyr(701)-dominant HSG cells).
CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation of Ser(727) in STAT1 might be more important in IFN<U+03B3> 
signaling and the induction of apoptosis in HSG cells than phosphorylation of
Tyr(701). Accordingly, we propose that phosphorylation of Ser(727) in STAT1 could
be a potentially suitable new therapeutic target for SS patients to prevent the
destruction of salivary glands.

BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a heritable marker of chronic
inflammation that is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. We sought
to identify genetic variants that are associated with CRP levels.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide association analysis of CRP in 66
185 participants from 15 population-based studies. We sought replication for the 
genome-wide significant and suggestive loci in a replication panel comprising 16 
540 individuals from 10 independent studies. We found 18 genome-wide significant 
loci, and we provided evidence of replication for 8 of them. Our results confirm 
7 previously known loci and introduce 11 novel loci that are implicated in
pathways related to the metabolic syndrome (APOC1, HNF1A, LEPR, GCKR, HNF4A, and 
PTPN2) or the immune system (CRP, IL6R, NLRP3, IL1F10, and IRF1) or that reside
in regions previously not known to play a role in chronic inflammation (PPP1R3B, 
SALL1, PABPC4, ASCL1, RORA, and BCL7B). We found a significant interaction of
body mass index with LEPR (P<2.9×10(-6)). A weighted genetic risk score that was 
developed to summarize the effect of risk alleles was strongly associated with
CRP levels and explained 5% of the trait variance; however, there was no
evidence for these genetic variants explaining the association of CRP with
coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 18 loci that were associated with CRP levels. Our
study highlights immune response and metabolic regulatory pathways involved in
the regulation of chronic inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: To study T-helper (Th)1-Th2-Th3 gene activation profile in the small
intestine and peripheral blood of children with celiac disease (CD) with special 
interest in the response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment in order to
elucidate an immune dysregulation not triggered by gluten.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Small intestinal biopsies and venous blood were taken from 
seven children with CD (mean age: 8 years, four girls) at presentation and after 
1 year of strict GFD. The Th1-Th2-Th3 gene expression profile was examined by
real-time PCR arrays. The findings were compared with the corresponding
expressions in peripheral blood and small intestinal biopsies from six reference 
children without CD (mean age: 6 years, four girls).
RESULTS: The Th1 gene expression profile including interferon (IFN)-<U+03B3>, signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and interferon regulatory
factor (IRF) 1 together with reduced interleukin (IL)-2 expression was pronounced
in small intestinal biopsies from children with untreated CD. A downregulation of
IFN-<U+03B3> transcripts was seen after 1 year of GFD, but there was still increased
expression of STAT1 and IRF1 in association with low IL-2 expression in spite of 
eliminated exposure to wheat gluten. By contrast, the decreased intestinal
expression of Th2 gene markers observed at presentation was normalized with GFD. 
The alterations in the mucosal gene expression profile were not reflected in
peripheral blood.
CONCLUSION: The GFD did not correct the increased activation of the IFN-<U+03B3>
signaling pathway related markers and reduced IL-2 expression, suggesting that
they represent an immune dysregulation not dependent on gluten exposure.

requiring novel phagosomal TLR7-mediated IFN-ß signaling.

Human fungal pathogens such as the dimorphic Candida albicans or the yeast-like
Candida glabrata can cause systemic candidiasis of high mortality in
immunocompromised individuals. Innate immune cells such as dendritic cells and
macrophages establish the first line of defense against microbial pathogens and
largely determine the outcome of infections. Among other cytokines, they produce 
type I IFNs (IFNs-I), which are important modulators of the host immune response.
Whereas an IFN-I response is a hallmark immune response to bacteria and viruses, 
a function in fungal pathogenesis has remained unknown. In this study, we
demonstrate a novel mechanism mediating a strong IFN-ß response in mouse
conventional dendritic cells challenged by Candida spp., subsequently
orchestrating IFN-a/ß receptor 1-dependent intracellular STAT1 activation and IFN
regulatory factor (IRF) 7 expression. Interestingly, the initial IFN-ß release
bypasses the TLR 4 and TLR2, the TLR adaptor Toll/IL-1R domain-containing
adapter-inducing IFN-ß and the ß-glucan/phagocytic receptors dectin-1 and CD11b. 
Notably, Candida-induced IFN-ß release is strongly impaired by Src and Syk family
kinase inhibitors and strictly requires completion of phagocytosis as well as
phagosomal maturation. Strikingly, TLR7, MyD88, and IRF1 are essential for IFN-ß 
signaling. Furthermore, in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis we show that
IFN-I signaling promotes persistence of C. glabrata in the host. Our data uncover
for the first time a pivotal role for endosomal TLR7 signaling in fungal pathogen
recognition and highlight the importance of IFNs-I in modulating the host immune 
response to C. glabrata.

We applied peptide array methylation to determine an optimized target sequence
for the SET7/9 (KMT7) protein lysine methyltransferase. Based on this, we
identified 91 new peptide substrates from human proteins, many of them better
than known substrates. We confirmed methylation of corresponding protein domains 
in vitro and in vivo with a high success rate for strongly methylated peptides
and showed methylation of nine nonhistone proteins (AKA6, CENPC1, MeCP2, MINT,
PPARBP, ZDH8, Cullin1, IRF1, and [weakly] TTK) and of H2A and H2B, which more
than doubles the number of known SET7/9 targets. SET7/9 is inhibited by
phosphorylation of histone and nonhistone substrate proteins. One lysine in the
MINT protein is dimethylated in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that the product 
pattern created by SET7/9 depends on the amino acid sequence context of the
target site.

S-adenosylmethionine prevents the up regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)
signaling caused by chronic ethanol feeding in rats.

Toll-like receptors (TLR) play a role in mediating the proinflammatory response, 
fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis in chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic liver
disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis C and hepatocellular carcinoma.
This is true in experimental models of these diseases. For this reason, we
investigated the TLR proinflammatory response in the chronic intragastric tube
feeding rat model of alcohol liver disease. The methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine
was also fed to prevent the gene expression changes induced by ethanol. Ethanol
feeding tended to increase the up regulation of the gene expression of TLR2 and
TLR4. SAMe feeding prevented this. TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels were
significantly increased by ethanol and this was prevented by SAMe. This is the
first report where ethanol feeding induced TLR2 and SAMe prevented the induction 
by ethanol. CD34, FOS, interferon responsive factor 1 (IRF-1), Jun, TLR 1,2,3,4,6
and 7 and Traf-6 were found to be up regulated as seen by microarray analysis
where rats were sacrificed at high blood alcohol levels compared to pair fed
controls. Il-6, IL-10 and IFN<U+03B3> were also up regulated by high blood levels of
ethanol. The gene expression of CD14, MyD88 and TNFR1SF1 were not up regulated by
ethanol but were down regulated by SAMe. The gene expression of IL-1R1 and IRF1
tended to be up regulated by ethanol and this was prevented by feeding SAMe. The 
results suggest that SAMe, fed chronically prevents the activation of TLR
pathways caused by ethanol. In this way the proinflammatory response,
fibrogenesis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma formation due to alcohol
liver disease could be prevented by SAMe.

The infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) belongs to the Birnaviridae
family of viruses and causes acute contagious diseases in a number of
economically important freshwater and marine fish. In this study, we infected
zebrafish embryonic cells (ZF4) with IPNV and analyzed the gene expression
patterns of normal and infected cells using quantitative real-time PCR. We
identified a number of immune response genes, including ifna, ifng, mx, irf1,
irf2, irf4, tnfa, tnfb, il-1b, il-15, il-26, ccl4 and mmp family genes, that are 
induced after viral infection. Transcriptional regulators, including cebpb, junb,
nfkb and stat1, stat4 and stat5, were also upregulated in IPNV-infected cells. In
addition, we used Pathway Studio software to identify TNFa as having the greatest
downstream influence among these altered genes. Treating virus-infected cells
with an siRNA targeting TNFa inhibited NF-<U+03BA>B expression. To further interrupt the
TNFa/NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated pathway, the expression levels of cytokines and
metalloproteinases were inhibited in IPNV-infected cells. These data suggest
that, during IPNV infection, the expression of cytokines and metalloproteinases
might be initiated through the TNFa/NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated pathway. The modulation of
TNFa/NF-<U+03BA>B-related mechanisms may provide a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting
viral infection in teleosts.

Cooperative contributions of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF8 to
interferon-<U+03B3>-mediated cytotoxic effects on oligodendroglial progenitor cells.

Medicine, Sacramento, California, USA.

BACKGROUND: Administration of exogenous interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN<U+03B3>) aggravates the
symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas interferon-ß (IFNß) is used for
treatment of MS patients. We previously demonstrated that IFN<U+03B3> induces apoptosis 
of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs), suggesting that IFN<U+03B3> is more toxic
to OPCs than IFNß. Thus we hypothesized that a difference in expression profiles 
between IFN<U+03B3>-inducible and IFNß-inducible genes in OPCs would predict the genes
responsible for IFN<U+03B3>-mediated cytotoxic effects on OPCs. We have tested this
hypothesis particularly focusing on the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)
well-known transcription factors up-regulated by IFNs.
METHODS: Highly pure primary rat OPC cultures were treated with IFN<U+03B3> and IFNß.
Cell death and proliferation were assessed by MTT reduction, caspase-3-like
proteinase activity, Annexin-V binding, mitochondrial membrane potential, and
BrdU-incorporation. Induction of all nine IRFs was comprehensively compared by
quantitative PCR between IFN<U+03B3>-treated and IFNß-treated OPCs. IRFs more strongly
induced by IFN<U+03B3> than by IFNß were selected, and tested for their ability to
induce OPC apoptosis by overexpression and by inhibition by dominant-negative
proteins or small interference RNA either in the presence or absence of IFN<U+03B3>.
RESULTS: Unlike IFN<U+03B3>, IFNß did not induce apoptosis of OPCs. Among nine IRFs,
IRF1 and IRF8 were preferentially up-regulated by IFN<U+03B3>. In contrast, IRF7 was
more robustly induced by IFNß than by IFN<U+03B3>. Overexpressed IRF1 elicited apoptosis
of OPCs, and a dominant negative IRF1 protein partially protected OPCs from
IFN<U+03B3>-induced apoptosis, indicating a substantial contribution of IRF1 to
IFN<U+03B3>-induced OPC apoptosis. On the other hand, overexpression of IRF8 itself had 
only marginal proapoptotic effects. However, overexpressed IRF8 enhanced the
IFN<U+03B3>-induced cytotoxicity and the proapoptotic effect of overexpressed IRF1, and 
down-regulation of IRF8 by siRNA partially but significantly reduced preapoptotic
cells after treatment with IFN<U+03B3>, suggesting that IRF8 cooperatively enhances
IFN<U+03B3>-induced OPC apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified that IRF1 and IRF8 mediate IFN<U+03B3>-signaling 
leading to OPC apoptosis. Therapies targeting at these transcription factors and 
their target genes could reduce IFN<U+03B3>-induced OPC loss and thereby enhance
remyelination in MS patients.

Foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells (Treg) is required for their development
and suppressive function. How different inflammatory signals affect Foxp3
chromatin structure, expression and Tregs plasticity are not completely known. In
the present study, the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligand peptidoglycan inhibited
Foxp3 expression in both natural Treg (nTreg) and TGFß-driven adaptive Treg
(aTreg). Inhibition was independent of paracrine Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines.
PGN-induced T cell-intrinsic TLR2-Myd88-dependent IFR1 expression and induced
IRF1 bound to IRF1 response elements (IRF-E) in the Foxp3 promoter and intronic
enhancers, and negatively regulated Foxp3 expression. Inflammatory IL-6 and TLR2 
signals induced divergent chromatin changes at the Foxp3 locus and regulated Treg
suppressor function, and in an islet transplant model resulted in differences in 
their ability to prolong graft survival. These findings are important for
understanding how different inflammatory signals can affect the transplantation
tolerance and immunity.

Not all individuals exposed to HIV become infected. Understanding why these
HIV-exposed seronegative individuals remain uninfected will help inform the
development of preventative measures against HIV infection. Interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF1) plays a critical role both in host antiviral immunity and in
HIV-1 replication. This study examined IRF1 expression regulation in the ex vivo 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-exposed seronegative commercial sex
workers who can be epidemiologically defined as relatively resistant to HIV
infection (HIV-R), versus HIV-uninfected, susceptible controls (HIV-S). Whereas
HIV-susceptible individuals demonstrated a biphasic, prolonged increase in IRF1
expression after interferon-<U+03B3> stimulation, HIV-R individuals demonstrated a
robust, but transient response. We also found that the IRF1 promoter in HIV-R was
primed by increased basal histone deacetylase-2 binding, independently of
transcription regulators, STAT1 and nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B/p65, implicating an
epigenetic silencing mechanism. Interestingly, the transitory IRF1 response in
HIV-R was sufficient in comparable regulation of interleukin-12 and interleukin-4
expression compared with the HIV-susceptible controls. This is the first study
characterizing IRF1 responsiveness in individuals who demonstrate altered
susceptibility to HIV infection. These data suggest that transitory IRF1
responsiveness in HIV-R may be one of the key contributors to the altered
susceptibility to HIV infection during the early stages of primary HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: Obesity causes insulin resistance in target tissues - skeletal
muscle, adipose tissue, liver and the brain. Insulin resistance predisposes to
type-2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adipose tissue
inflammation is an essential characteristic of obesity and insulin resistance.
Neuronatin (Nnat) expression has been found to be altered in a number of
conditions related to inflammatory or metabolic disturbance, but its
physiological roles and regulatory mechanisms in adipose tissue, brain,
pancreatic islets and other tissues are not understood.
RESULTS: We identified transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) conserved in the
Nnat promoter, and transcription factors (TF) abundantly expressed in adipose
tissue. These include transcription factors concerned with the control of:
adipogenesis (Ppar<U+03B3>, Klf15, Irf1, Creb1, Egr2, Gata3); lipogenesis (Mlxipl,
Srebp1c); inflammation (Jun, Stat3); insulin signalling and diabetes
susceptibility (Foxo1, Tcf7l2). We also identified NeuroD1 the only documented TF
that controls Nnat expression. We identified KEGG pathways significantly
associated with Nnat expression, including positive correlations with
inflammation and negative correlations with metabolic pathways (most prominently 
oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism)
and protein turnover. 27 genes, including; Gstt1 and Sod3, concerned with
oxidative stress; Sncg and Cxcl9 concerned with inflammation; Ebf1, Lgals12 and
Fzd4 involved in adipogenesis; whose expression co-varies with Nnat were
identified, and conserved transcription factor binding sites identified on their 
promoters. Functional networks relating to each of these genes were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that Nnat is an acute diet-responsive gene in
white adipose tissue and hypothalamus; it may play an important role in
metabolism, adipogenesis, and resolution of oxidative stress and inflammation in 
response to dietary excess.

IFN<U+03B3> exhibits potent antitumor effects and plays important roles in the innate
immunity against cancer. However, the mechanisms accounting for the
antiproliferative effects of IFN<U+03B3> still remain to be elucidated. We examined the 
role of Mnk1 (MAPK-interacting protein kinase 1) in IFN<U+03B3> signaling. Our data
demonstrate that IFN<U+03B3> treatment of sensitive cells results in engagement of Mnk1,
activation of its kinase domain, and downstream phosphorylation of the
cap-binding protein eIF4E on Ser-209. Such engagement of Mnk1 plays an important 
role in IFN<U+03B3>-induced IRF-1 (IFN regulatory factor 1) gene mRNA
translation/protein expression and is essential for generation of
antiproliferative responses. In studies aimed to determine the role of Mnk1 in
the induction of the suppressive effects of IFNs on primitive hematopoietic
progenitors, we found that siRNA-mediated Mnk1/2 knockdown results in partial
reversal of the suppressive effects of IFN<U+03B3> on human CD34+-derived myeloid
(CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors. These findings establish a key role
for the Mnk/eIF4E pathway in the regulatory effects of IFN<U+03B3> on normal
hematopoiesis and identify Mnk kinases as important elements in the control of
IFN<U+03B3>-inducible ISG mRNA translation.

The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway
is an important therapeutic target because of its role in the regulation of cell 
growth. Aberrant, constitutive activation of JAK2 signaling has been implicated
in myeloproliferative disorders with a single, activating somatic V617F mutation 
in the JH2 pseudokinase domain of JAK2 as the prevalent molecular lesion.
Invitrogen has developed the CellSensor(®) cell lines interferon regulatory
factor-1 (irf1)-beta-lactamase (bla) TF-1 and irf1-bla HEL for use in evaluating 
inhibitors of wild-type JAK2 and mutant JAK2 V617F, respectively. Both contain a 
bla reporter gene downstream of the irf1 response element stably integrated into 
either TF-1 or HEL cells. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based bla
substrate is utilized to give a robust detection of JAK2 activity. Examination of
Invitrogen's protocols for the two cell lines revealed significant differences
that are not conducive to direct comparison of inhibitor activities against
wild-type and mutant JAK2. Systematic changes to standardize the two assays were 
incorporated and evaluated for effects on assay response ratio, assay quality,
and potency for a diverse series of inhibitors.

Regulation of CEACAM1 transcription in human breast epithelial cells.

(1)Department of Immunology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, 
CA 91010, USA.

BACKGROUND: Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a
transmembrane protein with multiple functions in different cell types. CEACAM1
expression is frequently mis-regulated in cancer, with down-regulation reported
in several tumors of epithelial origin and de novo expression of CEACAM1 in lung 
cancer and malignant melanoma. In this report we analyzed the regulation of
CEACAM1 expression in three breast cancer cell lines that varied in CEACAM1
expression from none (MCF7) to moderate (MDA-MB-468) to high (MCF10A, comparable 
to normal breast).
RESULTS: Using in vivo footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
we show that the CEACAM1 proximal promoter in breast cells is bound in its active
state by SP1, USF1/USF2, and IRF1/2. When down-regulated the CEACAM1 promoter
remains accessible to USF2 and partially accessible to USF1. Interferon-<U+03B3>
up-regulates CEACAM1 mRNA by a mechanism involving further induction of IRF-1 and
USF1 binding at the promoter. As predicted by this analysis, silencing of IRF1
and USF1 but not USF2 by RNAi resulted in a significant decrease in CEACAM1
protein expression in MDA-MB-468 cells. The inactive CEACAM1 promoter in MCF7
cells exhibits decreased histone acetylation at the promoter region, with no
evidence of H3K9 or H3K27 trimethylation, histone modifications often linked to
condensed chromatin structure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that transcription activators USF1 and IRF1
interact to modulate CEACAM1 expression and that the chromatin structure of the
promoter is likely maintained in a poised state that can promote rapid induction 
under appropriate conditions.

Microglial activation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative disease by producing excessive proinflammatory cytokines and
nitric oxide (NO). Luteolin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic flavonoid
antioxidant, has potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties both in 
vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated immune
modulation in microglia is not fully understood. In the present study, we report 
the inhibitory effect of luteolin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon <U+03B3>
(IFN-<U+03B3>)-induced NO and proinflammatory cytokine production in rat primary
microglia and BV-2 microglial cells. Luteolin concentration-dependently abolished
LPS/IFN-<U+03B3>-induced NO, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß) 
production as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and mRNA
expression. Luteolin exerted an inhibitory effect on transcription factor
activity including nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B), signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in
LPS/IFN-<U+03B3>-activated BV-2 microglial cells. Biochemical and pharmacological
studies revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of luteolin was accompanied by
down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), Akt and Src. Further studies have demonstrated that the 
inhibitory effect of luteolin on intracellular signaling execution and
proinflammatory cytokine expression is associated with resolution of oxidative
stress and promotion of protein phosphatase activity. Together, these results
suggest that luteolin suppresses NF-<U+03BA>B, STAT1 and IRF-1 signaling, thus
attenuating inflammatory response of brain microglial cells.

Several common genomic loci, involving various immunity- and metabolism-related
genes, have been associated with plasma fibrinogen in European Americans (EAs).
The genetic determinants of fibrinogen in African Americans (AAs) are poorly
characterized. Using a vascular gene-centric array in 23,634 EA and 6657 AA
participants from 6 studies comprising the Candidate Gene Association Resource
project, we examined the association of 47,539 common and lower frequency
variants with fibrinogen concentration. We identified a rare Pro265Leu variant in
FGB (rs6054) associated with lower fibrinogen. Common fibrinogen gene single
nucleotide polymorphisms (FGB rs1800787 and FGG rs2066861) significantly
associated with fibrinogen in EAs were prevalent in AAs and showed consistent
associations. Several fibrinogen locus single nucleotide polymorphism associated 
with lower fibrinogen were exclusive to AAs; these include a newly reported
association with FGA rs10050257. For IL6R, IL1RN, and NLRP3 inflammatory gene
loci, associations with fibrinogen were concordant between EAs and AAs, but not
at other loci (CPS1, PCCB, and SCL22A5-IRF1). The association of FGG rs2066861
with fibrinogen differed according to assay type used to measure fibrinogen.
Further characterization of common and lower-frequency genetic variants that
contribute to interpopulation differences in fibrinogen phenotype may help refine
our understanding of the contribution of hemostasis and inflammation to
atherothrombotic risk.

Arsenic trioxide-mediated growth inhibition of myeloma cells is associated with
an extrinsic or intrinsic signaling pathway through activation of TRAIL or TRAIL 
receptor 2.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a well-known inhibitor of cell proliferation.
Preclinical and clinical studies showed that ATO has anti-myeloma effects.
However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, the molecular
mechanisms of ATO-induced myeloma apoptosis were explored on four myeloma cell
lines of wild type or mutant p53 status and also on six primary myeloma cells.
ATO induced potent inhibition of myeloma cell growth and myeloma cell apoptosis
compared with controls. Further investigation showed that ATO down-regulated
c-Myc and phosphorylated (p)-Rb while up-regulating p53, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1
proteins, resulting in G0/G1 or G2/M cell cycle arrest. ATO treatment increased
mRNA levels of interferon regulatory factor-1 and TRAIL, as well as protein
levels of caspase 8 and cleaved caspase 3, indicating the involvement of the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway in the mutated p53 myeloma cells. ATO also activated 
caspases 3 and 9, indicating involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in
the wild type p53 myeloma cells. More importantly, these molecular changes
induced by ATO-treated myeloma cells are very similar to the baseline expression 
pattern of hyperdiploid myeloma, which has a relative good prognosis with high
expression of TRAIL and interferon related genes. Together, our data suggest that
ATO induces apoptosis in MM through either extrinsic or intrinsic signaling
pathway, depending on the p53 genetic background. These observations may be
employed as prognostic tools and lead to novel therapies in primary myelomas.

associated with progression to dengue shock syndrome in Vietnamese children and
young adults.

Dengue is a pantropic public health problem. In children, dengue shock syndrome
(DSS) is the most common life-threatening complication. The ability to predict
which patients may develop DSS may improve triage and treatment. To this end, we 
conducted a nested case-control comparison of the early host transcriptional
features in 24 DSS patients and 56 sex-, age-, and virus serotype-matched
uncomplicated (UC) dengue patients. In the first instance, we defined the "early 
dengue" profile. The transcriptional signature in acute rather than convalescent 
samples (=72 h post-illness onset) was defined by an overabundance of
interferon-inducible transcripts (31% of the 551 overabundant transcripts) and
canonical gene ontology terms that included the following: response to virus,
immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response. Pathway and
network analyses identified STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, IRF7, IRF9, IRF1, CEBPB, and SP1
as key transcriptional factors mediating the early response. Strikingly, the only
difference in the transcriptional signatures of early DSS and UC dengue cases was
the greater abundance of several neutrophil-associated transcripts in patients
who progressed to DSS, a finding supported by higher plasma concentrations of
several canonical proteins associated with neutrophil degranulation
(bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein [BPI], elastase 2 [ELA2], and
defensin 1 alpha [DEF1A]). Elevated levels of neutrophil-associated transcripts
were independent of the neutrophil count and also of the genotype of the
infecting virus, as genome-length sequences of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1)
(n = 15) and DENV-2 (n = 3) sampled from DSS patients were phylogenetically
indistinguishable from those sampled from uncomplicated dengue patients (32
DENV-1 and 9 DENV-2 sequences). Collectively, these data suggest a hitherto
unrecognized association between neutrophil activation, pathogenesis, and the
development of DSS and point to future strategies for guiding prognosis.

Author information:

Stomatology Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, PR China.

OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to provide insights into genes governing the early
stages of cell proliferation ability alteration and mechano-response in human
periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) induced by short-term cyclic tensile stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary human PDLCs were subjected to cyclic tensile
stress (0.5 Hz, 5000 µstrain) for 2h through a four-point bending strain system. 
After that, cell viability and proliferation ability were examined by MTT
[3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay and flow
cytometry. Furthermore, the gene expression profile was investigated by
microarray analysis, and the reliability of which was verified by quantitative
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: MTT assay and flow cytometry demonstrated that mechanical stress
inhibited functional expression and slowed down proliferation of cells.
Microarray analysis showed that 110 genes related to cyclic tensile stress were
identified in total. Amongst them, ninety-seven were up-regulated, whilst 13 were
down-regulated. Eleven genes (KLF10, ETS1, CKS2, DUSP6, KIF23, MAPK6, SERTAD1,
IRF1, MAPRE1, CCNB1 and BCAR3) regarding cell cycle arrest were identified. Seven
up-regulated genes (PTGS2, KLF10, CDC42EP2, BHLHB2, SPRY2, IER3 and CCL2) were
verified by quantitative RT-PCR, which supported the microarray results.
CONCLUSION: Cell cycle arrest and the slow-down proliferation can benefit PDLCs
to have more time to respond to mechanical stimuli, and the differential gene
expression reflects the behaviour of cells. Those genes in response to cyclic
tensile stress were identified in human PDLCs, some of which are related with the
mechano-induced cell cycle arrest.

Insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet is associated with the induction of
genes related to leukocyte activation in rat peripheral leukocytes.

Sciences and the Global COE, Shizuoka, Japan.

AIMS: Insulin resistance caused by a high-fat diet induces type 2 diabetes and
its complications. In this study, we investigated gene expression changes in
peripheral leukocytes with insulin resistance by conducting microarray analyses
in rats with high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance.
MAIN METHODS: After assessing insulin resistance in rats by an oral glucose
tolerance test, we performed microarray analyses using peripheral leukocytes from
normal rats and insulin-resistant rats after fasting. Real-time RT-PCR analyses
were performed for several upregulated genes in the microarray data after fasting
and at 3h after a single oral glucose load.
KEY FINDINGS: Feeding rats a high-fat diet for 77days induced moderate insulin
resistance. Microarray analysis showed that the high-fat diet enhances many genes
related to leukocyte activation. These upregulated genes included genes related
to host defense, and many genes related to G-protein-coupled receptor/tyrosine
receptor signaling. Moreover, many genes, such as Anxa1, S100a8, Il22ra2, Gng10, 
Csf3r and Cd302, showed further upregulation of their expression after a single
oral glucose load. Exposure to high glucose and/or tumor necrosis factor-a which 
is known to be a factor that induces insulin resistance, enhanced the mRNA levels
of DUSP1, ANXA1, IL1B, S100A8, IL22RA2, S100A9 and IRF1 in human monocyte-like
U937 cells.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that the expression of genes related to
leukocyte activation in peripheral leukocytes is associated with the development 
of moderate insulin resistance.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is a member of IRF-family that was
discovered to activate promoters in type I interferon (IFN) genes. It is shown to
play functionally diverse role in the regulation of the immune system. In this
report, the porcine IRF1 cDNA were cloned and a 7500 bp genomic DNA structure was
identified. The putative IRF1 protein included 322 amino acids. Alignment and
phylogenetic analysis of the predicted porcine IRF1 amino acids sequence with its
homologies of other species show high identity (over 88%). Tissues expression of 
IRF1 mRNA was observed by RT-PCR, the results revealed IRF1 gene expressed widely
in all analyzed tissues. Using the radiation hybrid panel, the porcine IRF1 gene 
was mapped to porcine chromosome 2 and closely linked to the locus IL4 (LOD =
7.09, 57cR). A SNP in exon2 of porcine IRF1 gene was demonstrated by sequencing
and PCR-RFLP analysis. The further association analysis indicated that the SNP
was significant associate with level of IFN-<U+03B3> (day 20) in serum (P = 0.0001) and 
the ratio of IFN-<U+03B3> to IL10 (day 20; day 35) in serum (P = 0.0165; P = 0.0095).
The results suggested that the porcine IRF1 gene is strong candidate gene for
these immune traits in pig.

BACKGROUND: Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) gene was discovered as a tumour suppressor
gene. Later findings have suggested that WT1 also can be oncogenic. This
complexity is partly explained by the fact that WT1 has a number of target genes.
METHOD: WT1 and its target gene human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)
were analysed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In vitro experiments
were performed to examine the functional link between WT1 and hTERT by
overexpression of WT1 isoforms in the ccRCC cell line, TK-10.
RESULTS: WT1 demonstrated lower RNA expression in ccRCC compared with renal
cortical tissue, whereas hTERT was increased, showing a negative correlation
between WT1 and hTERT (P=0.005). These findings were experimentally confirmed in 
vitro. The WT1 generated effect on hTERT promoter activity seemed complex, as
several negative regulators of hTERT transcription, such as SMAD3, JUN (AP-1) and
ETS1, were activated by WT1 overexpression. Downregulation of potential positive 
hTERT regulators, such as cMyc, AP-2a, AP-2<U+03B3>, IRF1, NFX1 and GM-CSF, were also
observed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis verified WT1 binding to the
hTERT, cMyc and SMAD3 promoters.
CONCLUSION: The collected data strongly indicate multiple pathways for hTERT
regulation by WT1 in ccRCC.

Menin and RNF20 recruitment is associated with dynamic histone modifications that
regulate signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-activated
transcription of the interferon regulatory factor 1 gene (IRF1).

BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation of
gene expression is both rapid and transient, and when properly executed it
affects growth, differentiation, homeostasis and the immune response, but when
dysregulated it contributes to human disease. Transcriptional activation is
regulated by alterations to the chromatin template. However, the role of histone 
modification at gene loci that are activated for transcription in response to
STAT signaling is poorly defined.
RESULTS: Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we profiled several histone
modifications during STAT1 activation of the interferon regulatory factor 1 gene 
(IRF1). Methylated lysine histone proteins H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K79me3, H3K36me3
and monoubiquitinated histone ubH2B are dynamic and correlate with interferon
(IFN)<U+03B3> induction of STAT1 activity. Chemical inhibition of H3K4 methylation
downregulates IRF1 transcription and decreases RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
occupancy at the IRF1 promoter. MEN1, a component of a complex proteins
associated with Set1 (COMPASS)-like complex and the hBRE1 component, RNF20, are
localized to IRF1 in the uninduced state and are further recruited when IRF1 is
activated. RNAi-mediated depletion of RNF20 lowers both ubH2B and H3K4me3, but
surprisingly, upregulates IFN<U+03B3> induced IRF1 transcription. The dynamics of
phosphorylation in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II are disrupted during
gene activation as well.
CONCLUSIONS: H2B monoubiquitination promotes H3K4 methylation, but the E3
ubiquitin ligase, RNF20, is repressive of inducible transcription at the IRF1
gene locus, suggesting that ubH2B can, directly or indirectly, affect Pol II CTD 
phosphorylation cycling to exert control on ongoing transcription.

Intracellular activation of interferon regulatory factor-1 by nanobodies to the
multifunctional (Mf1) domain.

Road South, Edinburgh EH4 2XR, Scotland, United Kingdom.

IRF-1 is a tumor suppressor protein that activates gene expression from a range
of promoters in response to stimuli spanning viral infection to DNA damage.
Studies on the post-translational regulation of IRF-1 have been hampered by a
lack of suitable biochemical tools capable of targeting the endogenous protein.
In this study, phage display technology was used to develop a monoclonal nanobody
targeting the C-terminal Mf1 domain (residues 301-325) of IRF-1. Intracellular
expression of the nanobody demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of
IRF-1 is constrained by the Mf1 domain as nanobody binding gave an increase in
expression from IRF-1-responsive promoters of up to 8-fold. Furthermore,
Mf1-directed nanobodies have revealed an unexpected function for this domain in
limiting the rate at which the IRF-1 protein is degraded. Thus, the increase in
IRF-1 transcriptional activity observed on nanobody binding is accompanied by a
significant reduction in the half-life of the protein. In support of the data
obtained using nanobodies, a single point mutation (P325A) involving the
C-terminal residue of IRF-1 has been identified, which results in greater
transcriptional activity and a significant increase in the rate of degradation.
The results presented here support a role for the Mf1 domain in limiting both
IRF-1-dependent transcription and the rate of IRF-1 turnover. In addition, the
data highlight a route for activation of downstream genes in the IRF-1 tumor

The homology between TRIM21 and Trypanosoma cruzi Antigen Clone 36 nucleotide
sequence was discovered in 1998 (Winkler et al., Parasite 5, 94-95) prior to the 
functions of Ro52, the TRIM21 protein product, being understood. Ro52 has since
been shown to be an Ubiquitin ligase targeting transcription factors, Interferon 
Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1) and Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3), in immune
cells. This communication explores the possibility that there is a connection
between the Clone 36 homologous sequence and perturbation of the host immune
system in Chagas' disease. RNA interference by the Clone 36 transcripts is
hypothesized as a mechanism for host immune suppression during acute Chagas'
disease and/or for autoimmunity in chronic Chagas' disease through
down-regulation of Ro52. In the chronic forms of the disease such as Chagas
Cardiomyopathy, Clone 36 RNA containing its repetitive motif may down-regulate
levels of Ro52 in monocytes, fibroblasts, or T cells, allowing IRF 1 and IRF3 to 
continuously stimulate transcription of interferons alpha and beta, a
pro-inflammatory state favoring autoimmunity. In acute Chagas' disease, messenger
RNA from Clone 36 could interfere with host macrophage Ro52 RNA, down-regulating 
the level of Ro52 so that it would stimulate less cytokine production, including 
IL-12/p40. This theory is thought to help the parasite avoid attack by the innate
immune system early in the acute phase of the disease. Experiments with
transgenic mice and genetically modified T. cruzi are discussed which may provide
insight to addressing these questions.

homeostasis.

Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary surfactant is required for lung function at birth and
throughout life. Lung lipid and surfactant homeostasis requires regulation among 
multi-tiered processes, coordinating the synthesis of surfactant proteins and
lipids, their assembly, trafficking, and storage in type II cells of the lung.
The mechanisms regulating these interrelated processes are largely unknown.
RESULTS: We integrated mRNA microarray data with array independent knowledge
using Gene Ontology (GO) similarity analysis, promoter motif searching, protein
interaction and literature mining to elucidate genetic networks regulating lipid 
related biological processes in lung. A Transcription factor (TF)-target gene
(TG) similarity matrix was generated by integrating data from different analytic 
methods. A scoring function was built to rank the likely TF-TG pairs. Using this 
strategy, we identified and verified critical components of a transcriptional
network directing lipogenesis, lipid trafficking and surfactant homeostasis in
the mouse lung.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the transcriptional network, SREBP, CEBPA, FOXA2, ETSF, GATA6
and IRF1 were identified as regulatory hubs displaying high connectivity. SREBP, 
FOXA2 and CEBPA together form a common core regulatory module that controls
surfactant lipid homeostasis. The core module cooperates with other factors to
regulate lipid metabolism and transport, cell growth and development, cell death 
and cell mediated immune response. Coordinated interactions of the TFs influence 
surfactant homeostasis and regulate lung function at birth.

High glucose up-regulates angiotensin II subtype 2 receptors via interferon
regulatory factor-1 in proximal tubule epithelial cells.

Earlier studies have reported an increase in the proximal tubule AT(2) receptor
(AT(2)R) expression in diabetes, with a beneficial role in kidney function and
blood pressure regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the increase in AT(2)R
protein expression is associated with an increased expression of transcription
factor IRF-1 in hyperglycemic rat and in high glucose-treated HK2 cells.
Knock-down of IRF-1 by siRNA in HK2 cells prevented high glucose-induced AT(2)R
up-regulation. The data suggest that IRF-1 is a transcriptional regulator of
AT(2)R expression in hyperglycemia, and warrant further studies to understand the
physiological role of IRF-1 along with AT(2)R in diabetic kidney.

dendritic cells.

BACKGROUND: Resistin, a member of adipokine family, is known to be involved in
the modulation of immune responses including inflammatory activity.
Interestingly, resistin is secreted by adipocytes in mice and rats whereas it is 
secreted by leukocytes in humans. However, the mechanism behind the effect of
resistin on the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) remains poorly
understood. Therefore, we examined regulatory effect of resistin on the induction
and cellular modification of Tregs.
RESULTS: Both protein and mRNA expression of FoxP3, a representative marker of
Tregs, increased in a dose-dependent manner when peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were treated with resistin. At the same time, resistin had no direct effect
on the induction of FoxP3 in CD4+ T cells, suggesting an indirect role through
other cells type(s). Since DCs are an important player in the differentiation of 
T cells, we focused on the role of DCs in the modulation of Tregs by resistin.
Resistin suppressed the expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and
its target cytokines, IL-6, IL-23p19 and IL-12p40, in DCs. Furthermore, FoxP3
expression is increased in CD4+ T cells when co-cultured with DCs and
concomitantly treated with resistin.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that resistin induces expansion of functional
Tregs only when co-cultured with DCs.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors known to play key 
roles in innate and adaptive immune responses, cell growth, apoptosis, and
development. Their function in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer remains to be
determined, however. In the present study, therefore, we examined epigenetic
inactivation of IRF1-9 in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. We found that
expression of IRF4, IRF5, and IRF8 was frequently suppressed in gastric cancer
cell lines; that methylation of the three genes correlated with their silencing; 
and that treating the cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
(DAC) restored their expression. Expression of IRF5 in cancer cells was enhanced 
by the combination of DAC treatment and adenoviral vector-mediated expression of 
p53, p63, or p73. Interferon-gamma-induced expression of IRF8 was also enhanced
by DAC. Moreover, treating gastric cancer cells with DAC enhanced the suppressive
effects of interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma on cell
growth. Among a cohort of 455 gastric cancer and noncancerous gastric tissue
samples, methylation of IRF4 was frequently observed in both gastric cancer
specimens and noncancerous specimens of gastric mucosa from patients with
multiple gastric cancers, which suggests IRF4 methylation could be a useful
molecular marker for diagnosing recurrence of gastric cancers. Our findings
indicate that epigenetic IRF inactivation plays a key role in tumorigenesis of
gastric cancer, and that inhibition of DNA methylation may restore the antitumor 
activity of interferons through up-regulation of IRFs.

The emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has become a world-wide
health concern. As drug resistance appears, a new generation of therapeutic
strategies will be required. Here, we introduce a nanotechnology approach for the
therapy of pan-demic and seasonal influenza virus infections. This approach uses 
gold nanorods (GNRs) to deliver an innate immune activator, pro-ducing a
localized therapeutic response. We demonstrated the utility of a biocompatible
gold nanorod, GNR-5'PPP-ssRNA nanoplex, as an antiviral strategy against type A
influenza virus. In human respiratory bronchial epithelial cells, this nanoplex
activated the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathogen recognition
pathway, resulting in increased expression of IFN-beta and other IFN-stimulated
genes (ISGs) (e.g., PKR, MDA5, IRF1, IRF7, and MX1). This increase in type I IFN 
and ISGs resulted in a decrease in the replication of H1N1 influenza viruses.
These findings suggest that further evaluation of biocompatible nanoplexes as
unique antivirals for treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses is
warranted.

Transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family are major 
regulators of the early immune responses against viral infections. In particular,
IRF1, IRF2, IRF3 and IRF7 of mammals are known to regulate the expression of type
I interferons (IFNs), which constitute the obligate cytokines for antiviral
defense. We therefore cloned the coding sequence of Atlantic salmon (As) IRF1,
IRF2, IRF3 and IRF7B. Expression profiles were studied in Atlantic salmon TO
cells after poly I:C (dsRNA) transfection, treatment with recombinant salmon
IFNa1 and infection with infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). The main findings
were that AsIRF1 was earliest up-regulated by all stimuli, while AsIRF3 and
AsIRF7 had a similar activation profile induced at a slightly later time point.
The ability to induce the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter was measured in a
luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that AsIRF1, AsIRF3 and AsIRF7B
were able to induce the promoter in a dose-dependent manner. AsIRF2 repressed the
promoter, while AsIRF7A and a splicing variant (AsIRF3D) lacking the interaction 
domain had almost no effect. Combination of AsIRF1 and AsIRF3 had a synergistic
stimulatory effect on the promoter compared to each of the two IRFs alone.
Overall, our findings suggest that AsIRF3 is the main regulator of salmon IFNa1
production along with AsIRF1, which is less potent. This confirms a similar role 
for salmon IRF3 as mammalian IRF3 to be one of the main IRFs eliciting salmon
IFNa1 production. Surprisingly, AsIRF7A and AsIRF7B seemed to have a lesser role 
in salmon IFNa1 induction, which may indicate that these factors have a larger
role in activating other IFN genes or interferon stimulatory genes of Atlantic
salmon.

Differential gene expression in bovine cells infected with wild type and
leaderless foot-and-mouth disease virus.

Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Greenport, New York 11944, USA.

The leader proteinase (L(pro)) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) plays a
critical role in viral pathogenesis. Molecular studies have demonstrated that
L(pro) inhibits translation of host capped mRNAs and transcription of some genes 
involved in the innate immune response. We have used microarray technology to
study the gene expression profile of bovine cells infected with wild type (WT) or
leaderless FMDV. Thirty nine out of approximately 22,000 bovine genes were
selectively up-regulated by 2 fold or more in leaderless versus WT virus infected
cells. Most of the up-regulated genes corresponded to IFN-inducible genes,
chemokines or transcription factors. Comparison of promoter sequences suggested
that host factors NF-kappaB, ISGF3G and IRF1 specifically contributed to the
differential expression, being NF-kappaB primarily responsible for the observed
changes. Our results suggest that L(pro) plays a central role in the FMDV evasion
of the innate immune response by inhibiting NF-kappaB dependent gene expression.

Chromosome 5q31 spans the T helper (Th) 2-related cytokine gene cluster, which is
potentially important in Th1/Th2 immune responses. The chromosome 5q23.2-31.3 has
been recently identified as a region with suggestive evidence of linkage to
tuberculosis in the Asian population. With the aim of fine-mapping a putative
tuberculosis susceptibility locus, we investigated a family-based association
test between the dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers within
chromosome 5q31 and tuberculosis in 205 Thai trio families. Of these, 75 SNPs
located within candidate genes covering SLC22A4, SLC22A5, IRF1, IL5, RAD50, IL13,
IL4, KIF3A and SEPT8 were genotyped using the DigiTag2 assay. Association
analysis revealed the most significant association with tuberculosis in
haplotypes comprising SNPs rs274559, rs274554 and rs274553 of SLC22A5 gene
(P(Global)=2.02 x 10(-6)), which remained significant after multiple testing
correction. In addition, two haplotypes within the SLC22A4 and KIF3A region were 
associated with tuberculosis. Haplotypes of SLC22A5 were significantly associated
with the expression levels of RAD50 and IL13. The results show that the variants 
carried by the haplotypes of SLC22A4, SLC22A5 and KIF3A region potentially
contribute to tuberculosis susceptibility among the Thai population.

IFNgamma restores breast cancer sensitivity to fulvestrant by regulating STAT1,
IFN regulatory factor 1, NF-kappaB, BCL2 family members, and signaling to
caspase-dependent apoptosis.

Medicine, Washington, DC 20057, USA.

Antiestrogens are effective therapies for the management of many estrogen
receptor-alpha (ER)-positive breast cancers. Nonetheless, both de novo and
acquired resistance occur and remain major problems in the clinical setting.
IFNgamma is an inflammatory cytokine that induces the expression and function of 
IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a tumor suppressor gene that can increase
antiestrogen responsiveness. We show that IFNgamma, but not IFNalpha, IFNbeta, or
fulvestrant (ICI; ICI 182,780; Faslodex), induces IRF1 expression in
antiestrogen-resistant MCF7/LCC9 and LY2 cells. Moreover, IFNgamma restores the
responsiveness of these cells to fulvestrant. Increased IRF1 activation
suppresses NF-kappaB p65 (RELA) activity, inhibits the expression of prosurvival 
(BCL2, BCL-W), and induces the expression of proapoptotic members (BAK,
mitochondrial BAX) of the BCL2 family. This molecular signaling is associated
with the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and
leads to increased mitochondrial membrane permeability; activation of caspase-7
(CASP7), CASP8, and CASP9; and induction of apoptosis but not autophagy. Whereas 
antiestrogen-resistant cells are capable of inducing autophagy through
IFN-mediated signaling, their ability to do so through antiestrogen-regulated
signaling is lost. The abilities of IFNgamma to activate CASP8, induce apoptosis,
and restore antiestrogen sensitivity are prevented by siRNA targeting IRF1,
whereas transient overexpression of IRF1 mimics the effects of IFNgamma
treatment. These observations support the exploration of clinical trials
combining antiestrogens and compounds that can induce IRF1, such as IFNgamma, for
the treatment of some ER-positive breast cancers.

    Nat Rev Immunol. 2010 Jul;10(7):465.
    Cell. 2010 May 14;141(4):570-2.

Peroxisomes have long been established to play a central role in regulating
various metabolic activities in mammalian cells. These organelles act in concert 
with mitochondria to control the metabolism of lipids and reactive oxygen
species. However, while mitochondria have emerged as an important site of
antiviral signal transduction, a role for peroxisomes in immune defense is
unknown. Here, we report that the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) adaptor protein MAVS 
is located on peroxisomes and mitochondria. We find that peroxisomal and
mitochondrial MAVS act sequentially to create an antiviral cellular state. Upon
viral infection, peroxisomal MAVS induces the rapid interferon-independent
expression of defense factors that provide short-term protection, whereas
mitochondrial MAVS activates an interferon-dependent signaling pathway with
delayed kinetics, which amplifies and stabilizes the antiviral response. The
interferon regulatory factor IRF1 plays a crucial role in regulating
MAVS-dependent signaling from peroxisomes. These results establish that
peroxisomes are an important site of antiviral signal transduction.

Murine toll-like receptor 2 activation induces type I interferon responses from
endolysosomal compartments.

Dietrich N(1), Lienenklaus S, Weiss S, Gekara NO.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig,
Germany.

BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are among the first-line sentinels for
immune detection and responsiveness to pathogens. The TLR2 subfamily of TLRs
(TLR1, TLR2, TLR6) form heterodimers with each other and are thus able to
recognize a broad range of components from several microbes such as yeast,
Gram-positive bacteria and protozoa. Until now, TLR2 activation by bacterial
ligands has long been associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines but not type I
interferon responses.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a variety of transgenic mice, here we
provide in vivo and in vitro data showing that TLR2 activation does in fact
induce interferon-beta and that this occurs via MyD88-IRF1 and -IRF7 pathways.
Interestingly, by microscopy we demonstrate that although a cell surface
receptor, TLR2 dependent induction of type I interferons occurs in endolysosomal 
compartments where it is translocated to upon ligand engagement. Furthermore, we 
could show that blocking receptor internalization or endolysosomal acidification 
inhibits the ability of TLR2 to trigger the induction type I interferon but not
pro-inflammatory responses.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicate that TLR2 activation induces
pro-inflammatory and type I interferon responses from distinct subcellular sites:
the plasma membrane and endolysosomal compartments respectively. Apart from
identifying and characterizing a novel pathway for induction of type I
interferons, the present study offers new insights into how TLR signaling
discriminates and regulates the nature of responses to be elicited against
extracellular and endocytosed microbes. These findings may also have clinical
implication. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs
following activation of TLRs is a central pathologic event in several
hyper-inflammatory conditions. The discovery that the induction of
pro-inflammatory and type I IFN responses can be uncoupled through
pharmacological manipulation of endolysosomal acidification suggests new avenues 
for potential therapeutic intervention against inflammations and sepsis.

Rational drug design: a GAGE derived peptide kills tumor cells.

Author information: 
(1)Davee Department of Neurology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.
r-kular@northwestern.edu

The current therapy of cancer fails to completely and exclusively target tumor
cells. An ideal target for cancer therapy should be expressed exclusively in
tumor cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Targeting such a candidate gene
would cause cell death only in tumor cells. A cancer testis antigen, GAGE, is
considered such a target as it is expressed in numerous tumors but silent in
normal tissues. Contribution of GAGE to tumorigenesis is evident from the fact
that overexpression of GAGE results in rescuing the cells from cell death induced
by interferon-gamma, Fas, Taxol and ionizing radiation. GAGE binds to Interferon 
Response Factor-1 (IRF1) and decreases its abundance, thus impacting cell death
pathways mediated by interferon-gamma. To dissect the region responsible for GAGE
activities, five peptides encompassing the whole sequence of GAGE protein were
designed. A string of arginine residues enabled the peptides to enter the cells. 
Surprisingly, peptide#1 consisting of N-terminal end of GAGE protein was able to 
induce cell death in HeLa cells. Interestingly, GAGE null HEK293 cells and
primary fibroblasts were less sensitive to the cell death induced by this
peptide. Furthermore, GAGE expression, endogenous or ectopic, resulted in
increased sensitization to cell death induced by this peptide suggesting its
dominant active properties. The tumors that express GAGE as a diagnostic marker
should be sensitive to this peptide while sparing GAGE null normal tissues
suggesting potential in cancer therapeutics.

human melanoma cells.

Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.

BACKGROUND: Endogenously produced interferons can regulate the growth of melanoma
cells and are administered exogenously as therapeutic agents to patients with
advanced cancer. We investigated the role of negative regulators of interferon
signaling known as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) in mediating
interferon-resistance in human melanoma cells.
METHODS: Basal and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma)-induced expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins was evaluated by
immunoblot analysis in a panel of n = 10 metastatic human melanoma cell lines, in
human embryonic melanocytes (HEM), and radial or vertical growth phase melanoma
cells. Over-expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins in melanoma cells was achieved
using the PINCO retroviral vector, while siRNA were used to inhibit SOCS1 and
SOCS3 expression. Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) was measured by
intracellular flow cytometry and IFN-stimulated gene expression was measured by
Real Time PCR.
RESULTS: SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins were expressed at basal levels in melanocytes
and in all melanoma cell lines examined. Expression of the SOCS1 and SOCS3
proteins was also enhanced following stimulation of a subset of cell lines with
IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. Over-expression of SOCS proteins in melanoma cell lines
led to significant inhibition of Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) and gene
expression following stimulation with IFN-alpha (IFIT2, OAS-1, ISG-15) or
IFN-gamma (IRF1). Conversely, siRNA inhibition of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in
melanoma cells enhanced their responsiveness to interferon stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that SOCS proteins are expressed in human
melanoma cell lines and their modulation can influence the responsiveness of
melanoma cells to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma.

IFN-lambda endocytosis and IFN-lambda responsive promoter activation are
dependent on cholesterol.

Recently, a relationship between receptor endocytosis and downstream signaling
has been documented for several immunomodulatory molecules. However, endocytosis 
of interferon-lambdas (IFN-lambdas) and its impact on IFN-lambda function has not
been studied. We show that IFN-lambda is internalized through a
cholesterol-dependent, dynamin-independent, and Rho family of GTPase-independent 
pathway in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of IFN-lambda
endocytosis by cholesterol depletion suppresses the activation of IFN-lambda
responsive promoters. These results suggest that IFN-lambda endocytosis
participates in regulating antiviral gene induction and thus may affect antiviral
immunity.

Viperin is an antiviral protein whose expression is highly upregulated during
viral infections via IFN-dependent and/or IFN-independent pathways. We examined
the molecular alterations induced by the transcriptional activator IFN regulatory
factor (IRF)-1 and found viperin to be among the group of IRF-1 regulated genes. 
From these data, it was not possible to distinguish genes that are primary
targets of IRF-1 and those that are targets of IRF-1-induced proteins, like
IFN-beta. In this study, we show that IRF-1 directly binds to the murine viperin 
promoter to the two proximal IRF elements and thereby induces viperin expression.
Infection studies with embryonal fibroblasts from different gene knock-out mice
demonstrate that IRF-1 is essential, whereas the type I IFN system is dispensable
for vesicular stomatitis virus induced viperin gene transcription. Further,
IRF-1, but not IFN type I, mediates the induction of viperin transcription after 
IFN-gamma treatment. In contrast, IRF-1 is not required for IFN-independent
viperin induction by Newcastle disease virus infection and by infection with a
vesicular stomatitis virus mutant that is unable to block IFN expression and
secretion. We conclude that the IRF-1 mediated type I IFN independent mechanism
of enhanced viperin expression provides a redundant mechanism to protect cells
from viral infections. This mechanism becomes important when viruses evade innate
immunity by antagonizing the induction and function of the IFN system.

[Regulation mechanism for rig-g gene expression induced by all-trans retinoic
acid].

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced
rig-g gene expression and to better understand the signal transduction of ATRA
during acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell differentiation, the luciferase
reporter assay, co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation were
used to clarify the basic transcriptional factors, which directly initiated the
expression of rig-g gene. The results showed that the expression of STAT2, IRF-9 
and IRF-1 could be upregulated by ATRA with different kinetics in NB4 cells.
IRF-9 was able to interact with STAT2 to form a complex, which could bind the
rig-g gene promoter and trigger the rig-g expression. IRF-1 alone could also
activate the reporter gene containing rig-g gene promoter, but C/EBPalpha could
strongly inhibit this transcription activity of IRF-1. It is concluded that
during ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation, IRF-1 is first upregulated by ATRA,
and then IRF-1 increases the protein levels of IRF-9 and STAT2 with the
downregulation of C/EBPalpha. The complex of IRF-9 and STAT2 is the primary
transcriptional factor for rig-g gene induction. This study will be helpful for
better understanding the signal transduction networks of ATRA during the course
of APL cell differentiation.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are critical mediators of gene expression,
cell growth and immune responses. We previously demonstrated that interferon
(IFN) induction of early viral transcription and replication in several mucosal
HPVs requires IRF-1 binding to a conserved interferon response element (IRE).
Here we show that the IRF-2 protein serves as a baseline transactivator of the
HPV-16 major early promoter, P97. Cotransfections in IRF knockout cells confirmed
that basal HPV-16 promoter activity was supported by both IRF-1 and IRF-2
complexes interacting with the promoter-proximal IRE in a dose-dependent manner. 
Furthermore, HPV-16 E7 expression downregulates the IRF-2 promoter, thus linking 
IRF-2 levels to viral transforming gene expression through a negative feedback
mechanism. Taken together, these observations reveal a complex viral strategy
utilizing multiple signal transduction pathways during the establishment and
maintenance of HPV persistence.

Critical role of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex in TLR-mediated
IL-27p28 gene expression revealing a two-step activation process.

In myeloid dendritic cells, activation of the IL-27p28 gene is selectively
induced by ligands of TLR4 or TLR3, both coupled to the Toll/IL-1R-related
domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN/IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 pathway. In
response to both ligands, autocrine type 1 IFN production was required for
optimal IL-27p28 expression. Type I IFN signaling was necessary for sustained
IRF1 activation and formation of the IRF9-containing IFN-stimulated gene factor 3
complex. Indeed, we demonstrated that IRF1 and IRF9 are sequentially activated
and recruited to the IL-27p28 IFN-stimulated regulatory element site. Involvement
of IRF1 and IRF9 in the induction of IL-27p28 was confirmed in vitro and upon in 
vivo exposure to TLR ligands. Thus, in response to TLR4 or TLR3 ligation, the
initial induction of the IL-27p28 gene depends on the recruitment of IRF1 and
IRF3, whereas transcriptional amplification requires recruitment of the
IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex. These results highlight the complex
molecular interplay between TLRs and type I IFNs for the control of IL-27
synthesis.

The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family is known to be crucial in mediating
the host defense against pathogen infection by binding to characteristic elements
in promoters within interferon (IFN) genes and IFN-inducible genes. In this
report, the full-length cDNA of IRF1 was cloned from the large yellow croaker,
Pseudosciaena crocea. It was of 1667 bp, including a 5'-terminal untranslated
region (UTR) of 142 bp, a 3'-terminal UTR of 674 bp and an open reading frame
(ORF) of 861 bp encoding a polypeptide of 286 amino acids. The putative amino
acid sequence contained a typical IRF domain at the N-terminal. Quantitative
real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed a broad expression of IRF1 
in most detected tissues, with the predominant expression in the gill and spleen 
and the weakest expression in the brain. The expression of IRF1 after challenged 
with LPS and poly I:C was tested in blood, spleen and liver, which showed that
IRF1 changed obviously with the most significantly up-regulated expression was 37
times (at 6 h) after injection with poly I:C in the blood and 13 times (at 3 h)
after injection with LPS in the liver compared with the control values (p <
0.01). These results indicated that as a crucial factor in regulating the IFN and
IFN-inducible elements in mammals, IRF1 might play an important role in large
yellow croaker defense against the pathogen infection.

Downregulation of microRNA-383 is associated with male infertility and promotes
testicular embryonal carcinoma cell proliferation by targeting IRF1.

Our previous studies have shown that microRNA-383 (miR-383) expression is
downregulated in the testes of infertile men with maturation arrest (MA).
However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-383 involved in the pathogenesis of MA 
remain unknown. In this study, we showed that downregulation of miR-383 was
associated with hyperactive proliferation of germ cells in patients with mixed
patterns of MA. Overexpression of miR-383 in NT2 (testicular embryonal carcinoma)
cells resulted in suppression of proliferation, G1-phase arrest and induction of 
apoptosis, whereas silencing of miR-383 reversed these effects. The effects of
miR-383 were mediated through targeting a tumor suppressor, interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF1), and miR-383 was negatively correlated with IRF1 protein
expression in vivo. miR-383 inhibited IRF1 by affecting its mRNA stability, which
subsequently reduced the levels of the targets of IRF1, namely cyclin D1, CDK2
and p21. Downregulation of IRF1 or cyclin D1, but not that of CDK2, enhanced
miR-383-mediated effects, whereas silencing of p21 partially inhibited the
effects of miR-383. Moreover, miR-383 downregulated CDK4 by increasing
proteasome-dependent degradation of CDK4, which in turn resulted in an inhibition
of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation. These results
suggest that miR-383 functions as a negative regulator of proliferation by
targeting IRF1, in part, through inactivation of the pRb pathway. Abnormal
testicular miR-383 expression may potentiate the connections between male
infertility and testicular germ cell tumor.

Gene modulation and immunoregulatory roles of interferon gamma.

Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) is a central regulator of the immune response and
signals via the Janus Activated Kinase (JAK)-Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription (STAT) pathway. Phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers translocate to the 
nucleus, bind to Gamma Activating Sequence (GAS) and recruit additional factors
to modulate gene expression. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that greater
number of putative promoters of immune related genes and also those not directly 
involved in immunity contain GAS compared to response elements (RE) for
Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)1, Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) and
Activator Protein (AP)1. GAS is present in putative promoters of well known
IFNgamma-induced genes, IRF1, GBP1, CXCL10, and other genes identified were TLR3,
VCAM1, CASP4, etc. Analysis of three microarray studies revealed that the
expression of a subset of only GAS containing immune genes were modulated by
IFNgamma. As a significant correlation exists between GAS containing immune genes
and IFNgamma-regulated gene expression, this strategy may identify novel
IFNgamma-responsive immune genes. This analysis is integrated with the literature
on the roles of IFNgamma in mediating a plethora of functions: anti-microbial
responses, antigen processing, inflammation, growth suppression, cell death,
tumor immunity and autoimmunity. Overall, this review summarizes our present
knowledge on IFNgamma mediated signaling and functions.

Novel loci, including those related to Crohn disease, psoriasis, and
inflammation, identified in a genome-wide association study of fibrinogen in 17
686 women: the Women's Genome Health Study.

BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen is a multifunctional circulating glycoprotein involved in 
wound healing, thrombosis, platelet aggregation, and inflammation, and elevated
levels predict vascular disease. Despite evidence of crucial biological function 
and moderate heritability, comprehensive analysis of the influence of genetic
variation on fibrinogen is not available.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To address this issue, we undertook a genome-wide
association study evaluating the potential relationships between 337 343
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and plasma fibrinogen levels among 17 686 
apparently healthy women participating in the Women's Genome Health Study. As
C-reactive protein is also an inflammatory marker known to predict cardiovascular
diseases, we compared the determinants of fibrinogen levels with those of
C-reactive protein. Four novel loci were identified, in addition to the
fibrinogen gene cluster, which were associated with fibrinogen levels at
genome-wide levels of significance (range of probability values from 8.82 x
10(-09) to 8.04 x 10(-39)). Two of the loci are related to common chronic
inflammatory diseases: the first, at locus 5q31.1 (SLC22A5, SLC22A4, IRF1), lies 
immediately adjacent to a locus linked to Crohn disease (P value for lead SNP,
1.24 x 10(-12)) and the second, at locus 17q25.1 (CD300LF, SLC9A3R1, NAT9), has
been associated with psoriasis (P value for lead SNP, 7.72 x 10(-11)). A third
locus at 1q21.3 (IL6R) lies within the interleukin 6 receptor gene, a critical
component of the inflammatory cascade (P value for lead SNP, 1.80 x 10(-11)). A
novel locus at 2q34 (CPSI) participates in the urea cycle (P=8.82 x 10(-09)). The
majority of implicated SNPs showed little evidence of dual association with
C-reactive protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: A genome-wide survey of the human genome identifies novel loci
related to common chronic inflammatory diseases as genetic determinants of
fibrinogen levels, in addition to loci that relate to the inflammatory cascade,
the urea cycle, and the fibrinogen gene cluster.

BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen is both central to blood coagulation and an acute-phase
reactant. We aimed to identify common variants influencing circulation fibrinogen
levels.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide association analysis on 6
population-based studies, the Rotterdam Study, the Framingham Heart Study, the
Cardiovascular Health Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the
Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease/KORA Augsburg
Study, and the British 1958 Birth Cohort Study, including 22 096 participants of 
European ancestry. Four loci were marked by 1 or more single-nucleotide
polymorphisms that demonstrated genome-wide significance (P<5.0 x 10(-8)). These 
included a single-nucleotide polymorphism located in the fibrinogen beta chain
(FGB) gene and 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms representing newly identified
loci. The high-signal single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1800789 in exon 7 of
FGB (P=1.8 x 10(-30)), rs2522056 downstream from the interferon regulatory factor
1 (IRF1) gene (P=1.3 x 10(-15)), rs511154 within intron 1 of the propionyl
coenzyme A carboxylase (PCCB) gene (P=5.9 x 10(-10)), and rs1539019 on the NLR
family pyrin domain containing 3 isoforms (NLRP3) gene (P=1.04 x 10(-8)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight biological pathways that may be important in 
regulation of inflammation underlying cardiovascular disease.

Chromium(VI) stimulates Fyn to initiate innate immune gene induction in human
airway epithelial cells.

Author information:

Pennsylvania 15219, USA.

Mechanisms for pathogenic metal signaling in airway injury or disease promotion
are poorly understood. It is widely believed that one mechanism for pathogenic
and possible carcinogenic effects of inhaled chromium (Cr(VI)) is inhibition of
inducible gene transactivation. However, we recently reported that Cr(VI)
inhibition of Sp1-dependent transactivation required signal transducer and
activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-dependent expression of an inhibitory
protein in airway epithelium. Thus, Cr(VI) exposures can induce genes, and we
hypothesized that this induction resulted from Cr(VI) signaling through an innate
immune-like STAT1-dependent pathway initiated by Fyn. Exposure of human airway
epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells to Cr(VI) selectively transactivated the
STAT-responsive interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and induced
ISRE-driven transactivation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), without
affecting the gamma interferon-activated site (GAS)-driven IRF1 expression.
Cr(VI)-induced IRF7 was absent or greatly reduced in cells that lacked STAT1,
were treated with the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, or lacked Fyn. Expressing
Fyn, but not Src, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells null for Src, Yes, and Fyn
restored Cr(VI)-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRF7 expression.
Finally, shRNA knockdown of Fyn in BEAS-2B cells prevented Cr(VI)-activated STAT1
transactivation of IRF7. These data support a novel mechanism through which
Cr(VI) stimulates Fyn to initiate interferon-like signaling for STAT1-dependent
gene transactivation.

Roles of IKK-beta, IRF1, and p65 in the activation of chemokine genes by
interferon-gamma.

Shultz DB(1), Rani MR, Fuller JD, Ransohoff RM, Stark GR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195,
USA.

Activation of chemokine genes in response to interferon (IFN)-gamma or NF-kappaB 
is an important aspect of inflammation. Using the chemokine gene ip-10 in mouse
embryonic fibroblast cells as an example, we show that the response to IFN-gamma 
is long lasting but secondary: initial STAT1 activation drives IRF1 synthesis,
and IRF1 then binds to IFN-stimulated regulatory elements (ISREs) in the ip-10
promoter. The promoters of most IKK-beta-dependent IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)
also contain ISREs. In response to IFN-gamma, inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB)
kinase beta (IKK-beta) is required to activate both newly synthesized IRF1 and
the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, which contributes to ip-10 expression by binding to
kappaB sites in the ip-10 promoter, with little or no activation of classical
NF-kappaB. In contrast to IFN-gamma, IL-1beta induces ip-10 expression rapidly
but transiently, by activating classical NF-kappaB and increasing the synthesis
of IRF1. Together, IL-1beta and IFN-gamma induce ip-10 synergistically. IFN-gamma
does not affect the transient activation of classical NF-kappaB by IL-1beta and
synergistic induction of ip-10 expression by IFN-gamma and IL-1beta occurs even
after the activation of classical NF-kappaB has returned to basal levels.
Therefore, IKK-beta has a novel role in IFN-gamma-dependent activation of
chemokine gene expression through its activation of IRF1 and p65.

Previously, we reported guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) and interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) elevated in the rat peripheral blood during acute
cellular rejection (ACR), which are identified from transcriptome analysis of
liver graft, as leukocyte-related gene in liver. In this study, we investigated
whether these two genes could differentially diagnose ACR from other types of
liver dysfunction (LD) clinically. The mRNAs from leukocytes of 19 patients with 
ACR and 27 with LD, as well as from liver biopsies of 12 patients with ACR and 12
with LD, were analysed by real-time PCR for GBP2 and IRF1 expression. Sensitivity
and specificity were calculated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
curves. Guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) and interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) gene expression levels in ACR samples were higher than that in controls,
and GBP2 expression in blood was higher than that in LD (26.4 +/- 3.1 and 15.6
+/- 1.9, P = 0.0203). Multivariate analysis showed that the ratio
GBP2/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was independent of
ACR-related factors (OR = 0.911, P = 0.035). GBP2 expression levels in ACR were
also higher than that in liver transplantation patients with hepatitis C or no
LD. Using a cut-off value of 20, the sensitivity and specificity of GBP2/GAPDH
based on ROC curve analysis were 63% and 85% respectively. GBP2 in the patients
with LD may be useful for diagnosis of ACR.

Human rhinovirus-induced epithelial production of CXCL10 is dependent upon IFN
regulatory factor-1.

and Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Calgary, Calgary,

Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are associated with exacerbations of
lower-airway diseases. HRV-induced production of proinflammatory chemokines, such
as CXCL10, from infected airway epithelial cells may play a role in the
pathogenesis of exacerbations. We have previously shown that the MAP/ERK kinase
(MEK) pathway selectively down-regulates HRV-16-induced epithelial production of 
CXCL10 by modulating nuclear translocation and/or binding of IFN regulatory
factor (IRF)-1 with the CXCL10 promoter. Using primary human bronchial epithelial
cells (HBEs) and the BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cell line, we have further
evaluated the role of IRF-1 in HRV-16-induced epithelial CXCL10 production. We
demonstrate that HRV-16 induced the expression of both IRF-1 mRNA and protein in 
a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, MEK1 pathway inhibition with PD98059 or
U0126 significantly enhanced HRV-16-induced IRF-1 mRNA levels in BEAS-2B cells
and HBEs, although IRF-1 protein expression was only enhanced in HBEs. Using
short interfering RNA (siRNA), we both inhibited HRV-16-induced IRF-1 expression 
and reduced nuclear translocation and/or binding of IRF-1 to the CXCL10 promoter.
Knockdown of IRF-1 also led to a significant reduction in HRV-16-induced CXCL10
production, confirming that IRF-1 is directly involved in HRV-16-induced CXCL10
expression in epithelial cells. Moreover, pronounced IRF-1 knockdown abrogated
the enhancement of CXCL10 normally induced by inhibitors of the MEK1 pathway.
Phosphatase experiments indicate that IRF-1 binding to the CXCL10 promoter is not
dependent upon its phosphorylation state. We conclude that HRV-16-induced CXCL10 
production is dependent upon IRF-1, and that the MEK1 pathway-dependent
suppression of CXCL10 expression is also mediated via effects on IRF-1.

Conceptus-uterus interactions in pigs: endometrial gene expression in response to
estrogens and interferons from conceptuses.

This review highlights information on conceptus-uterus interactions in the pig
with respect to uterine gene expression in response to estrogens and interferons 
(IFNs) secreted from elongating conceptuses. Pig conceptuses release estrogens
for pregnancy recognition, but also secrete IFNs that do not appear to be
antiluteolytic. Estrogens and IFNs induce expression of largely non-overlapping
sets of genes, and evidence suggests that pig conceptuses orchestrate essential
events of early pregnancy including pregnancy recognition signaling, implantation
and secretion of histotroph by precisely controlling temporal and spatial
(cell-specific) changes in uterine gene expression through initial secretion of
estrogens, followed by cytokines including IFNG and IFND. By Day 12 of pregnancy,
estrogens increase the expression of multiple genes in the uterine luminal
epithelium including SPP1, STC1, IRF2 and STAT1 that likely have roles for
implantation. By Day 15 of pregnancy, IFNs upregulate a large array of IFN
responsive genes in the underlying stroma and glandular epithelium including
ISG15, IRF1, STAT1, SLAs and B2M that likely have roles in uterine remodeling to 
support placentation.

Previously, we identified the regions of chromosomes 10q12-q31 and 15p16-q21
harbor quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for lumbar volumetric bone mineral density 
(vBMD) in female F2 rats derived from Fischer 344 (F344) x Lewis (LEW) and
Copenhagen 2331 (COP) x Dark Agouti (DA) crosses. The purpose of this study is to
identify the candidate genes within these QTL regions contributing to the
variation in lumbar vBMD. RNA was extracted from bone tissue of F344, LEW, COP,
and DA rats. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230
2.0 Arrays. Genes differentially expressed among the rat strains were then ranked
based on the strength of the correlation with lumbar vBMD in F2 animals derived
from these rats. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed to confirm the
prioritized candidate genes. A total of 285 genes were differentially expressed
among all strains of rats with a false discovery rate less than 10%. Among these 
genes, 18 candidate genes were prioritized based on their strong correlation (r
(2) > 0.90) with lumbar vBMD. Of these, 14 genes (Akap1, Asgr2, Esd, Fam101b,
Irf1, Lcp1, Ltc4s, Mdp-1, Pdhb, Plxdc1, Rabep1, Rhot1, Slc2a4, Xpo4) were
confirmed by qPCR. We identified several novel candidate genes influencing spinal
vBMD in rats.

Cellular senescence guards against cancer and modulates aging; however, the
underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that genotoxic
drugs capable of inducing premature senescence in normal and cancer cells, such
as 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), distamycin A (DMA), aphidicolin and
hydroxyurea, persistently activate Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator
of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling and expression of interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs), such as MX1, OAS, ISG15, STAT1, PML, IRF1 and IRF7, in several
human cancer cell lines. JAK1/STAT-activating ligands, interleukin 10 (IL10),
IL20, IL24, interferon gamma (IFNgamma), IFNbeta and IL6, were also expressed by 
senescent cells, supporting autocrine/paracrine activation of JAK1/STAT.
Furthermore, cytokine genes, including proinflammatory IL1, tumor necrosis factor
and transforming growth factor families, were highly expressed. The strongest
inducer of JAK/STAT signaling, cytokine production and senescence was BrdU
combined with DMA. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of JAK1 abolished
expression of ISGs, but not DNA damage signaling or senescence. Thus, although
DNA damage signaling, p53 and RB activation, and the cytokine/chemokine secretory
phenotype are apparently shared by all types of senescence, our data reveal so
far unprecedented activation of the IFNbeta-STAT1-ISGs axis, and indicate a less 
prominent causative role of IL6-JAK/STAT signaling in genotoxic drug-induced
senescence compared with reports on oncogene-induced or replicative senescence.
These results highlight shared and unique features of drug-induced cellular
senescence, and implicate induction of cancer secretory phenotype in
chemotherapy.

Inferring the transcriptional landscape of bovine skeletal muscle by integrating 
co-expression networks.

BACKGROUND: Despite modern technologies and novel computational approaches,
decoding causal transcriptional regulation remains challenging. This is
particularly true for less well studied organisms and when only gene expression
data is available. In muscle a small number of well characterised transcription
factors are proposed to regulate development. Therefore, muscle appears to be a
tractable system for proposing new computational approaches.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report a simple algorithm that asks
"which transcriptional regulator has the highest average absolute co-expression
correlation to the genes in a co-expression module?" It correctly infers a number
of known causal regulators of fundamental biological processes, including cell
cycle activity (E2F1), glycolysis (HLF), mitochondrial transcription (TFB2M),
adipogenesis (PIAS1), neuronal development (TLX3), immune function (IRF1) and
vasculogenesis (SOX17), within a skeletal muscle context. However, none of the
canonical pro-myogenic transcription factors (MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5, MYF6 and MEF2C) 
were linked to muscle structural gene expression modules. Co-expression values
were computed using developing bovine muscle from 60 days post conception (early 
foetal) to 30 months post natal (adulthood) for two breeds of cattle, in addition
to a nutritional comparison with a third breed. A number of transcriptional
landscapes were constructed and integrated into an always correlated landscape.
One notable feature was a 'metabolic axis' formed from glycolysis genes at one
end, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein genes at the other, and centrally
tethered by mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial protein genes.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The new module-to-regulator algorithm complements our
recently described Regulatory Impact Factor analysis. Together with a simple
examination of a co-expression module's contents, these three gene expression
approaches are starting to illuminate the in vivo transcriptional regulation of
skeletal muscle development.

IFN{gamma} regulates retinal pigment epithelial fluid transport.

Li R(1), Maminishkis A, Banzon T, Wan Q, Jalickee S, Chen S, Miller SS.

Author information: 
(1)NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-2510, USA.

The present experiments show that IFNgamma receptors are mainly localized to the 
basolateral membrane of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Activation of
these receptors in primary cultures of human fetal RPE inhibited cell
proliferation and migration, decreased RPE mitochondrial membrane potential,
altered transepithelial potential and resistance, and significantly increased
transepithelial fluid absorption. These effects are mediated through JAK-STAT and
p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Second messenger signaling through cAMP-PKA pathway-
and interferon regulatory factor-1-dependent production of nitric oxide/cGMP
stimulated the CFTR at the basolateral membrane and increased transepithelial
fluid absorption. In vivo experiments using a rat model of retinal reattachment
showed that IFNgamma applied to the anterior surface of the eye can remove extra 
fluid deposited in the extracellular or subretinal space between the retinal
photoreceptors and RPE. Removal of this extra fluid was blocked by a combination 
of PKA and JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors injected into the subretinal space. These 
results demonstrate a protective role for IFNgamma in regulating retinal
hydration across the outer blood-retinal barrier in inflammatory disease
processes and provide the basis for possible therapeutic interventions.

Comment in
    Mol Cell. 2009 Sep 24;35(6):731-2.

To unravel the roles of LXRs in inflammation and immunity, we examined the
function of LXRs in development of IFN-gamma-mediated inflammation using cultured
rat brain astrocytes. LXR ligands inhibit neither STAT1 phosphorylation nor STAT1
translocation to the nucleus but, rather, inhibit STAT1 binding to promoters and 
the expression of IRF1, TNFalpha, and IL-6, downstream effectors of STAT1 action.
Immunoprecipitation data revealed that LXRbeta formed a trimer with PIAS1-pSTAT1,
whereas LXRalpha formed a trimer with HDAC4-pSTAT1, mediated by direct ligand
binding to the LXR proteins. In line with the fact that both PIAS1 and HDAC4
belong to the SUMO E3 ligase family, LXRbeta and LXRalpha were SUMO-conjugated by
PIAS1 or HDAC4, respectively, and SUMOylation was blocked by transient
transfection of appropriate individual siRNAs, reversing LXR-induced suppression 
of IRF1 and TNFalpha expression. Together, our data show that SUMOylation is
required for the suppression of STAT1-dependent inflammatory responses by LXRs in
IFN-gamma-stimulated brain astrocytes.

Influence of apple polyphenols on inflammatory gene expression.

Jung M(1), Triebel S, Anke T, Richling E, Erkel G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biotechnology, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern,
Germany.

Apples (Malus spp., Rosaceae) and products thereof contain high amounts of
polyphenols which show diverse biological activities and may contribute to
beneficial health effects, like protecting the intestine against inflammation
initiated by chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD are characterized by 
an excessive release of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by
different cell types which results consequently in an increased inflammatory
response. In the present study we investigated the preventive effectiveness of
polyphenolic juice extracts and single major constituents on inflammatory gene
expression in immunorelevant human cell lines (DLD-1, T84, MonoMac6, Jurkat)
induced with specific stimuli. Besides the influence on proinflammatory gene
expression, the effect on NF-kappaB-, IP-10-, IL-8-promoter-, STAT1-dependent
signal transduction, and the relative protein levels of multiple released
cytokines and chemokines were studied. DNA microarray analysis of several genes
known to be strongly regulated during gastrointestinal inflammation, combined
with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the apple juice extract
AE04 (100-200 microg/mL) significantly inhibited the expression of NF-kappaB
regulated proinflammatory genes (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CXCL9, CXCL10),
inflammatory relevant enzymes (COX-2, CYP3A4), and transcription factors (STAT1, 
IRF1) in LPS/IFN-gamma stimulated MonoMac6 cells without significant effects on
the expression of house-keeping genes. A screening of some major compounds of
AE04 revealed that the flavan-3-ol dimer procyanidin B(2 )is mainly responsible
for the anti-inflammatory activity of AE04. Furthermore, the dihydrochalcone
aglycone phloretin and the dimeric flavan-3-ol procyanidin B(1 )significantly
inhibited proinflammatory gene expression and repressed NF-kappaB-, IP-10-,
IL-8-promoter-, and STAT1-dependent signal transduction in a dose-dependent
manner. The influence on proinflammatory gene expression by the applied
polyphenols thereby strongly correlated with the increased protein levels
investigated by human cytokine array studies. In summary, we evaluated selected
compounds responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of AE04. In particular, 
procyanidin B(1), procyanidin B(2), and phloretin revealed anti-inflammatory
activities in vitro and therefore may serve as transcription-based inhibitors of 
proinflammatory gene expression.

Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

PURPOSE: The discovery of effective biomarkers is a fundamental goal of molecular
medicine. Developing a systems-biology understanding of radiosensitivity can
enhance our ability of identifying radiation-specific biomarkers.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiosensitivity, as represented by the survival fraction 
at 2 Gy was modeled in 48 human cancer cell lines. We applied a linear regression
algorithm that integrates gene expression with biological variables, including
ras status (mut/wt), tissue of origin and p53 status (mut/wt).
RESULTS: The biomarker discovery platform is a network representation of the top 
500 genes identified by linear regression analysis. This network was reduced to a
10-hub network that includes c-Jun, HDAC1, RELA (p65 subunit of NFKB), PKC-beta, 
SUMO-1, c-Abl, STAT1, AR, CDK1, and IRF1. Nine targets associated with
radiosensitization drugs are linked to the network, demonstrating clinical
relevance. Furthermore, the model identified four significant radiosensitivity
clusters of terms and genes. Ras was a dominant variable in the analysis, as was 
the tissue of origin, and their interaction with gene expression but not p53.
Overrepresented biological pathways differed between clusters but included DNA
repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. The c-Jun network hub was
validated using a knockdown approach in 8 human cell lines representing lung,
colon, and breast cancers.
CONCLUSION: We have developed a novel radiation-biomarker discovery platform
using a systems biology modeling approach. We believe this platform will play a
central role in the integration of biology into clinical radiation oncology
practice.

Restriction of Legionella pneumophila replication in macrophages requires
concerted action of the transcriptional regulators Irf1 and Irf8 and nod-like
receptors Naip5 and Nlrc4.

Promenade Sir William Osler, Room 907, Montréal, Québec, Canada H3G 1Y6.

The unique permissiveness of A/J mouse macrophages for replication of Legionella 
pneumophila is caused by a deficiency in the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein and 
intracellular sensor for L. pneumophila flagellin (Naip5). The signaling pathways
and proteins activated by Naip5 sensing in macrophages were investigated.
Transcript profiling of macrophages from susceptible A/J mice and from resistant 
A/J mice harboring a transgenic wild-type copy of Naip5 at 4 h following L.
pneumophila infection suggested that two members of the Irf transcriptional
regulator family, Irf1 and Irf8, are regulated in response to Naip5 sensing of L.
pneumophila. We show that macrophages having defective alleles of either Irf1
(Irf1-/-) or its heterodimerization partner gene Irf8 (Irf8R294C) become
permissive for L. pneumophila replication, indicating that both the Irf1 and Irf8
proteins are essential for macrophage defense against L. pneumophila. Moreover,
macrophages doubly heterozygous (Naip5AJ/WT Irf8R294C/WT or Nlrc4-/+
Irf8R294C/WT) for combined loss-of-function mutations in Irf8 and in either Naip5
or Nlrc4 are highly susceptible to L. pneumophila, indicating that there is a
strong genetic interaction between Irf8 and the NLR protein family in the
macrophage response to L. pneumophila. Legionella-containing phagosomes (LCPs)
formed in permissive Irf1-/- or Irf8R294C macrophages behave like LCPs formed in 
Naip5-insufficient and Nlrc4-deficient macrophages which fail to acidify. These
results suggest that, in addition to Naip5 and Nlrc4, Irf1 and Irf8 play a
critical role in the early response of macrophages to infection with L.
pneumophila, including antagonizing the ability of L. pneumophila to block
phagosome acidification. They also suggest that flagellin sensing by the NLR
proteins Naip5 and Nlrc4 may be coupled to Irf1-Irf8-mediated transcriptional
activation of key effector genes essential for macrophage resistance to L.
pneumophila infection.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a polygenic disorder affecting
approximately 1 in 1000 adults. Recent data have implicated interferons (IFN) in 
the pathogenesis, and the expressions of many genes downstream of IFNs are
regulated at the level of histone modifications. We examined H4 acetylation
(H4ac) and gene expression in monocytes from patients with SLE to define
alterations to the epigenome. Monocytes from 14 controls and 24 SLE patients were
used for analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation for H4ac and gene expression
arrays. Primary monocytes treated with alpha-IFN were used as a comparator. Data 
were analyzed for concordance of H4ac and gene expression. Network analyses and
transcription factor analyses were conducted to identify potential pathways. H4ac
was significantly altered in monocytes from patients with SLE. In all, 63% of
genes with increased H4ac had the potential for regulation by IFN regulatory
factor (IRF)1. IRF1 binding sites were also upstream of nearly all genes with
both increased H4ac and gene expression. alpha-IFN was a significant contributor 
to both expression and H4ac patterns, but the greatest concordance was seen in
the enrichment of certain transcription factor binding sites upstream of genes
with increased H4ac in SLE and genes with increased H4ac after alpha-IFN
treatment.

Frequent loss of heterozygosity at the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene locus 
in breast cancer.

(1)Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown
University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20057, USA.

The interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) gene, localized on chromosome 5q31.1,
is mutated or rearranged in several cancers including some hematopoietic and
gastric cancers. However, whether loss of IRF1 occurs in sporadic breast cancer
is unknown. Loss of 5q12-31 is reported in 11% of sporadic breast cancers, and
high-resolution array-CGH studies have shown loss at 5q31.1 in 50% of breast
cancers with a mutated BRCA1 gene. Functionally, overexpression of IRF1 reduces, 
and a dominant negative IRF1 construct increases, tumorigenesis of human breast
cancer xenografts. Taken together, these observations indicate that the IRF1 gene
may play a potentially important role as a breast cancer tumor suppressor gene.
In this study, we investigated allelic loss of the IRF1 gene in breast tumor
specimens from 52 women with invasive breast cancer using an IRF1 intragenic
dinucleotide polymorphic marker. Thirty-seven cases were informative. LOH at the 
IRF1 locus was detected in 32% of these informative cases (12/37). There was a
significant association between IRF1 loss and both older age (P = 0.0167) and
earlier stage (Stages 1 and 2) (P = 0.0165). To assess the association of IRF1
mRNA expression with clinical outcomes in breast cancer, we studied data from two
published gene expression microarray datasets. In breast cancer patients, low
IRF1 mRNA expression is strongly correlated with both risk of recurrence (OR =
3.00; P = 0.003; n = 273 cases) and risk of death (OR = 4.18; P = 0.004; n = 191 
cases). Our findings strongly imply a tumor suppressor role for the IRF1 gene in 
breast cancer.

Type I interferon receptor-independent and -dependent host transcriptional
responses to mouse hepatitis coronavirus infection in vivo.

BACKGROUND: The role of type I IFNs in protecting against coronavirus (CoV)
infections is not fully understood. While CoVs are poor inducers of type I IFNs
in tissue culture, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the type I
IFN response in controlling MHV infection in animals. The protective effectors
against MHV infection are, however, still unknown.
RESULTS: In order to get more insight into the antiviral gene expression induced 
in the brains of MHV-infected mice, we performed whole-genome expression
profiling. Three different mouse strains, differing in their susceptibility to
infection with MHV, were used. In BALB/c mice, which display high viral loads but
are able to control the infection, 57 and 121 genes were significantly
differentially expressed (> or = 1.5 fold change) upon infection at 2 and 5 days 
post infection, respectively. Functional association network analyses
demonstrated a strong type I IFN response, with Irf1 and Irf7 as the central
players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. 
Both the type I and II IFN response, which were more pronounced in mice with a
higher viral load, were not observed in 129SvEv mice, which are much less
susceptible to infection with MHV. 129SvEv mice lacking the type I interferon
receptor (IFNAR-/-), however, were not able to control the infection. Gene
expression profiling of these mice identified type I IFN-independent responses to
infection, with IFN-gamma as the central player. As the BALB/c and the IFNAR-/-
129SvEv mice demonstrated very similar viral loads in their brains, we also
compared their gene expression profiles upon infection with MHV in order to
identify type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses. Many known IFN-inducible
genes were detected, several of which have previously been shown to play an
important protective role against virus infections. We speculate that the
additional type I IFN-dependent genes that we discovered may also be important
for protection against MHV infection.
CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of mice infected with MHV demonstrated the 
induction of a robust IFN response, which correlated with the viral load.
Profiling of IFNAR-/- mice allowed us to identify type I IFN-independent and
-dependent responses. Overall, this study broadens our present knowledge of the
type I and II IFN-mediated effector responses during CoV infection in vivo.

The GAGE family of highly related tumor antigens is expressed in a variety of
tumors. This albeit silent gene expression resulted in resistance of cells to
various apoptotic agents such as Fas, interferon-gamma, Taxol, or
gamma-radiation. We now report that GAGE overexpression in either HeLa
(expressing endogenous GAGE) or HEK293 (devoid of GAGE expression) rendered those
cells unsusceptible to cell death induced by IFN-gamma. We investigated the
underlying mechanism of GAGE-induced cell survival upon treatment with IFN-gamma 
in this report. We showed that GAGE overexpression resulted in down-regulation of
a key player of IFN-gamma-signaling pathway, interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1), and its target genes caspase-1 and caspase-7. An interaction between GAGE
and IRF1 is detected in cells. Furthermore, GAGE interacted with a
multifunctional protein nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23 and increased its abundance by
stabilizing the protein. Increased level of NPM/B23 in conjunction with decreased
level of IRF1 could aid GAGE-induced resistance to IFN-gamma. Our results suggest
that GAGE could rescue cell death induced by IFN-gamma by altering the level of
key players in cell death pathways. As GAGE is silent in most healthy tissues,
targeting GAGE could result in therapeutic interventions in cancer therapy.

This manuscript presents the first extensive phylogenetics analysis of a key
family of immune regulators, the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. The
IRF family encodes transcription factors that play important roles in immune
defense, stress responses, reproduction, development, and carcinogenesis. Several
times during their evolution, the IRF genes have undergone expansion and
diversification. These genes were also completely lost on two separate occasions 
in large groups of metazoans. The origin of the IRF family coincides with the
appearance of multicellularity in animals. IRF genes are present in all principal
metazoan groups, including sea sponges, placozoans, comb jellies, cnidarians, and
bilaterians. Although the number of IRF family members does not exceed two in
sponges and placozoans, this number reached five in cnidarians. At least four
additional independent expansions lead up to 11 members in different groups of
bilaterians. In contrast, the IRF genes either disappeared or mutated beyond
recognition in roundworms and insects, the two groups that include most of the
metazoan species. The IRF family separated very early into two branches
ultimately leading to vertebrate IRF1 and IRF4 supergroups (SGs). Genes encoding 
the IRF-SGs are present in all bilaterians and cnidarians. The evolution of
vertebrate IRF family members further proceeded with at least two additional
steps. First, close to the appearance of the first vertebrate, the IRF family
probably expanded to four family members, predecessors of the four vertebrate IRF
groups (IRF1, 3, 4, 5 groups). In the second step, 10 vertebrate family members
evolved from these four genes, likely as a result of the 2-fold duplication of
the entire genome. Interestingly, the IRF family coevolved with the Rel/NF-kappaB
family with which it shares some important evolutionary characteristics,
including roles in defense responses, metazoan specificity, extensive
diversification in vertebrates, and elimination of all family members in
nematodes.

Adhesion molecules have a key role in pathological inflammation. Thus, we
investigated the effect of anthocyanins on the induction of intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by
TNF-alpha and the possible molecular mechanisms by which anthocyanins
differentially regulate ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Stimulation of cells with
TNF-alpha increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and pretreatment with
anthocyanins inhibited VCAM-1 expression, but not ICAM-1 expression. We found
that IRF-1 and GATAs, especially GATA-4 and -6, were involved in the
TNF-alpha-mediated expression of VCAM-1 but not ICAM-1, and anthocyanins
decreased nuclear levels of GATA-4 and GATA-6 as well as IRF-1. Moreover,
pretreatment with a Jak/STAT inhibitor decreased TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1
expression and nuclear GATA-4, GATA-6, and IRF-1 levels. Furthermore,
anthocyanins efficiently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT-3. This suggests
that anthocyanins differentially regulate TNF-alpha-mediated expression of VCAM-1
and ICAM-1 through modulation of the GATA and IRF-1 binding activity via
Jak/STAT-3 activation.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer is an important female malignancy. The discovery of
human papillomavirus (HPV) as an etiologic agent of cervical cancer has prompted 
increased interest in the biology and oncogenicity of this virus. The E7 protein 
is found predominantly in the nucleus and, to a lesser extent, in the cytoplasm
in cervical cancer cell lines. HPV E7 has been shown to be functionally
associated with the tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 in
cervical carcinogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, new gene ontology technology was used to
predict changes in the molecular function and biologic processes caused by the
interaction between IRF-1 and HPV E7.
RESULTS: The molecular function and biologic processes of IRF-1 and the combined 
IRF-1 and HPV E7 (IRF-1-E7) were derived using the GoFigure server. The combined 
IRF-1-E7 demonstrated more functions and biologic processes compared with IRF-1
alone.
CONCLUSION: IRF-1-E7 was shown to be responsible for the positive regulation of
many interleukins and to be involved in the differentiation of T-helper cells.

Interferons (IFNs) have been used to treat mucosal lesions caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV) infection, such as intraepithelial precursor lesions to
cancer of the uterine cervix, genital warts or recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis, to potentially reduce or eliminate replicating HPV plasmid
genomes. Mucosal HPVs have evolved mechanisms that impede IFN-beta synthesis and 
downregulate genes induced by IFN. Here we show that these HPV types directly
subvert a cellular transcriptional response to IFN-beta as a potential boost in
infection. Treatment with low levels of human IFN-beta induced initial
amplification of HPV-16 and HPV-11 plasmid genomes and increased HPV-16 or HPV-31
DNA copy numbers up to 6-fold in HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. IFN treatment
also increased early gene transcription from the major early gene promoters in
HPV-16, HPV-31 and HPV-11. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the viral genomes and
ectopic interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression in transfection experiments
using IRF-1(-/-), IRF-2(-/-) and dual knockout cell lines determined that these
responses are due to the activation of IRF-1 interaction with a conserved
interferon response element demonstrated in several mucosal HPV early gene
promoters. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the varying clinical
outcomes of IFN therapy of papillomatoses and define an assay for the modulation 
of the HPV gene program by IFNs as well as other cytokines and signaling
molecules in infection and therapy.

Nitric oxide inhibits IFN regulatory factor 1 and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways 
in rhinovirus-infected epithelial cells.

University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) has previously been shown to inhibit human
rhinovirus (HRV) replication in airway epithelial cells and to inhibit
rhinovirus-induced epithelial cytokine and chemokine production independently of 
its effects on viral replication by modulating nuclear translocation and binding 
of transcription factors.
OBJECTIVE: To define the molecular mechanisms by which NO inhibits HRV-16-induced
epithelial production of CXCL10 by affecting nuclear translocation and binding of
nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1).
METHODS: Cultured human airway epithelial cells were infected with HRV-16 in the 
absence or presence of a NO donor, or were preincubated with 2 highly selective
inhibitors of inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK)beta and then infected with HRV-16.
Effects on the NF-kappaB and IRF-1 pathways were examined by using
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Western blotting, and real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Nitric oxide directly inhibited the binding of both recombinant
NF-kappaB p50 protein and recombinant IRF-1 to their recognition sequences from
the CXCL10 promoter. NO also inhibited phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB
inhibitor, IkappaBalpha, in HRV-16-infected cells. In addition, both NO and
inhibitors of IKKbeta inhibited viral induction of IRF-1 mRNA and protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Nitric oxide blocks rhinovirus-mediated activation and nuclear
translocation of both NF-kappaB and IRF-1. NO also directly inhibits the binding 
of each of these transcription factors to their respective recognition sites in
the CXCL10 promoter. In addition, the ability of HRV-16 to induce epithelial
expression of IRF-1 is dependent, at least in part, on viral activation of
NF-kappaB.

Our understanding of the post-translational processes involved in regulating the 
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) tumor suppressor protein is limited. The
introduction of mutations within the C-terminal Mf1 domain (amino acids 301-325) 
impacts on IRF-1-mediated gene repression and growth suppression as well as the
rate of IRF-1 degradation. However, nothing is known about the proteins that
interact with this region to modulate IRF-1 function. A biochemical screen for
Mf1-interacting proteins has identified an LXXLL motif that is required for
binding of Hsp70 family members and cooperation with Hsp90 to regulate IRF-1
turnover and activity. These conclusions are supported by the finding that Hsp90 
inhibitors suppress IRF-1-dependent transcription shortly after treatment,
although at later time points inhibition of Hsp90 leads to an Hsp70-dependent
depletion of nuclear IRF-1. Conversely, the half-life of IRF-1 is increased by
Hsp90 in an ATPase-dependent manner leading to the accumulation of nuclear but
not cytoplasmic IRF-1. This study begins to elucidate the role of the Mf1 domain 
of IRF-1 in orchestrating the recruitment of regulatory factors that can impact
on both its turnover and transcriptional activity.

Prior studies have demonstrated that cholera toxin (CT) and other cAMP-inducing
factors inhibit interleukin (IL)-12 production from monocytes and dendritic cells
(DCs). We show that CT inhibits Th1 responses in vivo in mice infected with
Toxoplasma gondii. This correlated with low serum IL-12 levels and a selective
reduction in the numbers of CD8alpha(+) conventional DCs (cDCs) in lymphoid
organs. CT inhibited the function of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 8, 
a transcription factor known to positively regulate IL-12p35 and p40 gene
expression, and the differentiation of CD8alpha(+) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs).
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that exposure to CT,
forskolin, or dibutyryl (db) cAMP blocked LPS and IFN-gamma-induced IRF8 binding 
to chromatin. Moreover, CT and dbcAMP inhibited the binding of IRF8 to the
IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-like element in the mouse IL-12p40
promoter, likely by blocking the formation of ISRE-binding IRF1-IRF8
heterocomplexes. Furthermore, CT inhibited the differentiation of pDCs from
fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand-treated bone marrow cells in vitro. Therefore, 
because IRF8 is essential for IL-12 production and the differentiation of
CD8alpha(+) cDCs and pDCs, these data suggest that CT and other Gs-protein
agonists can affect IL-12 production and DC differentiation via a common
mechanism involving IRF8.

Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are inducible feedback
inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of
transcription signalling (STAT) pathways. Interferon (IFN)-gamma induces the
expression of the socs1 gene in several cell types through several cis elements
present in its promoter and their binding proteins. Socs1 expression is induced
in the human keratinocytes HaCaT cell line through sequential activation of STAT1
and IRF-1. Comparison of the 5'-upstream sequences of the mouse and human socs1
genes identified conserved binding sites for IRF-1 regulatory elements. Although 
this response element is able to bind IRF-1 in human cells, no IFN-gamma
responsiveness was observed with human socs1 promoter reporter constructs
containing this element. In contrast the mouse socs1 promoter was fully
responsive. The mouse promoter contains two cis-acting elements which modulate
its expression and are recognized by IRF-1 and Sp2. Despite the absence of Sp2 in
the 5'-upstream sequence of the human promoter, silencing of Sp2 by RNA
interference clearly demonstrated that Sp2 is required for IFN-gamma-induced
regulation of socs1 mRNA both in human and mouse.

Interferon-triggered transcriptional cascades in the oligodendroglial lineage: a

Interferon-gamma induces major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) in
proliferating oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPC), but to a much lesser
extent in mature oligodendrocytes. Interferon-beta has virtually no effects on
MHC-II induction even in OPC. Interferon-gamma-mediated transcriptional induction
of CIITA, a critical regulator of MHC-II induction, was 6-fold lower in mature
oligodendrocytes than in OPC, and entirely dependent on promoter IV, suggesting
that the transcriptional activity of promoter IV is down-regulated after
differentiation. The distinct difference in MHC-II induction between
interferon-gamma and interferon-beta is attributed to transient
interferon-beta-mediated activation of STAT1-IRF1 signaling compared to the
sustained interferon-gamma-mediated activation.

Trenbolone, an anabolic androgen, and flutamide, an antiandrogen, are
prototypical model compounds for agonism and antagonism of the androgen receptor.
We hypothesized that 48 h exposures of female fathead minnows (Pimephales
promelas) to environmentally relevant concentrations of these chemicals would
alter genes regulated by the androgen receptor and that a mixture of the two
compounds would block the effects. Gene expression in the ovaries was analyzed
using a fathead minnow-specific 22,000-gene microarray. Flutamide altered
abouttwicethe number of genes astrenbolone, most of which appeared to be through 
pathways not associated with the androgen receptor. A group of 70 genes, of which
we could identify 37, were reciprocally regulated by trenbolone and flutamide.
These are candidates for specific biomarkers for androgen receptor mediated gene 
expression. Four genes stand out as specifically related to reproduction: sperm
associated antigen 8 (SPAG8), CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR),
corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases
(3beta-HSD). Three notable transcriptional regulators including myelocytomatosis 
viral oncogene homologue (MYC), Yin Yang 1 (YY1), and interferon regulator factor
1 (IRF1) may function as early molecular switches to control phenotypic changes
in ovary tissue architecture and function in response to androgen or antiandrogen
exposure.

Resistance to endocrine therapies, whether de novo or acquired, remains a major
limitation in the ability to cure many tumors that express detectable levels of
the estrogen receptor alpha protein (ER). While several resistance phenotypes
have been described, endocrine unresponsiveness in the context of therapy-induced
tumor growth appears to be the most prevalent. The signaling that regulates
endocrine resistant phenotypes is poorly understood but it involves a complex
signaling network with a topology that includes redundant and degenerative
features. To be relevant to clinical outcomes, the most pertinent features of
this network are those that ultimately affect the endocrine-regulated components 
of the cell fate and cell proliferation machineries. We show that autophagy, as
supported by the endocrine regulation of monodansylcadaverine staining, increased
LC3 cleavage, and reduced expression of p62/SQSTM1, plays an important role in
breast cancer cells responding to endocrine therapy. We further show that the
cell fate machinery includes both apoptotic and autophagic functions that are
potentially regulated through integrated signaling that flows through key members
of the BCL2 gene family and beclin-1 (BECN1). This signaling links cellular
functions in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, the latter as a consequence 
of induction of the unfolded protein response. We have taken a seed-gene approach
to begin extracting critical nodes and edges that represent central signaling
events in the endocrine regulation of apoptosis and autophagy. Three seed nodes
were identified from global gene or protein expression analyses and supported by 
subsequent functional studies that established their abilities to affect cell
fate. The seed nodes of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), interferon regulatory 
factor-1 (IRF1), and X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1)are linked by directional
edges that support signal flow through a preliminary network that is grown to
include key regulators of their individual function: NEMO/IKKgamma, nucleophosmin
and ER respectively. Signaling proceeds through BCL2 gene family members and
BECN1 ultimately to regulate cell fate.

Types I and II interferons upregulate the costimulatory CD80 molecule in
monocytes via interferon regulatory factor-1.

CD80/B7.1 expressed on monocytes plays a prominent role in the activation of T
cell-mediated immunity and its level is reduced in monocytes from cancer
patients. Type I (alpha/beta) and type II (gamma) IFNs are widely administered as
adjuvant therapy. We show here that both classes of IFNs upregulate CD80 mRNA and
protein in primary monocytes ex vivo. The stimulatory action of IFN-alpha/beta on
CD80 is accompanied by the activation of both interferon regulatory factors IRF-1
and IRF-7, whereas IFN-gamma stimulating effect is associated only with IRF-1
induction. IFNs concomitantly upregulate the transcription of CD40 costimulatory 
molecule whose activation is known to require IRF-1. In monocytic U937 cells,
IRF-1 is activated by IFN-gamma but not by IFN-alpha/beta, whereas it is the
reverse for IRF-7; in the latter cells, only IFN-gamma is capable of stimulating 
CD80 transcription emphasizing the essential role of IRF-1. Moreover, siRNA
against IRF-1 prevents IFN-gamma-mediated CD80 activation. In AML cells, IFNs
upregulate CD40, CD80 and IRF-1 in the FAB-M4/M5 subtypes but not in the less
differentiated M1/M2 subtypes. Monitoring the expression of CD80 on AML cells and
its modulation by IFNs could help to predict the patients more susceptible to
benefit from therapeutic strategies aimed at eliciting specific T cell responses 
to leukemia-associated antigens.

Little is known of how and where bacterial recognition triggers the induction of 
type I interferon. Whether the type of recognition receptor used in these
responses is determined by the subcellular location of bacteria is not
understood. Here we show that phagosomal bacteria such as group B streptococcus, 
but not cytosolic bacteria, potently induced interferon in conventional dendritic
cells by a mechanism that required Toll-like receptor 7, the adaptor MyD88 and
the transcription factor IRF1, all of which localized together with bacterial
products in degradative vacuoles bearing lysosomal markers. Thus, this cell
type-specific recognition pathway links lysosomal recognition of bacterial RNA
with a robust, host-protective interferon response.

IL-18 induction of osteopontin mediates cardiac fibrosis and diastolic
dysfunction in mice.

(1)Surgery Department and Sarver Heart Center, College of Medicine, University of
Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.

Osteopontin (OPN), a key component of the extracellular matrix, is associated
with the fibrotic process during tissue remodeling. OPN and the cytokine
interleukin (IL)-18 have been shown to be overexpressed in an array of human
cardiac pathologies. In the present study, we determined the role of IL-18 in the
regulation of cardiac OPN expression and the subsequent interstitial fibrosis and
diastolic dysfunction. We demonstrated parallel increases in IL-18, OPN
expression, and interstitial fibrosis in murine models of left ventricular
pressure and volume overload. Exogenous recombinant (r)IL-18 administered for 2
wk increased cardiac OPN expression, interstitial fibrosis, and diastolic
dysfunction. Stimulation of the T helper (Th)1 lymphocyte phenotype with a
selective toll-like receptor (TLR)9 agonist induced cardiac IL-18 and OPN
expression, which was associated with increased cardiac fibrillar collagen
concentrations and interstitial fibrosis resulting in diastolic dysfunction.
rIL-18 induced OPN expression and protein levels in primary of cardiac fibroblast
cultures. Conditioned media from TLR9-stimulated T lymphocyte cultures induced
IL-18 and OPN expression in cardiac fibroblasts, while blockade of the IL-18
receptor with a neutralizing antibody abolished the increase in OPN expression.
Furthermore, a mutation in the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory
factor (IRF)1 or IRF1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the decreased
expression of IL-18 and OPN in cardiac fibroblasts. With pressure overload,
IRF1-mutant mice showed downregulation of IL-18 and OPN expression in cardiac
tissue, reduced cardiac fibrotic development, and increased left ventricular
function compared with wild type. These results provide direct evidence that the 
induction of IL-18 regulates OPN-mediated cardiac fibrosis and diastolic
dysfunction.

Malignant transformation of hepatocytes is frequently associated with
upregulation of HLA-A expression. Currently there is no information available
regarding the mechanisms underlying this phenotypic change. We investigated HLA-A
expression in 165 paraffin embedded tissues and 21 fresh tissues from liver
cancer patients. Utilizing truncated HLA-A promoter-reporter constructs and
gel-shift assay we had identified the regulatory elements and transcription
factors required for HLA-A upregulation. 54% of the paraffin embedded tissues
showed increased HLA-A expression in their cancerous part. 43% of the fresh liver
cancer tissues had increased HLA-A complex expression with the HLA-A heavy chain 
gene demonstrating the highest level of upregulation (62%). Enhanced HLA-A
expression in the liver cell lines QGY7701 and BEL7402 was found to be mediated
by binding of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) to interferon stimulated
response element, and of nuclear transcription factor p65 binding to enhancer A
element in the HLA-A promoter of these cell lines. The in vivo relevance of these
findings was indicated by the association of the enhanced expression of IRF-1 and
accumulation of nuclear p65 with HLA-A upregulation in 8 of the 21 liver cancer
lesions investigated. Our results indicated that HLA-A upregulation in liver
cancer was mediated by both increased nuclear aggregation of transcription factor
p65 and upregulation of transcription factor IRF-1.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the level of interferon regulatory factor
(IRF) 1, 3, and 7 in peripheral blood cells from patients with primary Sjogren
syndrome (pSS) and to determine whether and where IRF1 exists in the parotid
glands of pSS.
METHODS: Peripheral blood cells and parotid gland biopsy specimens from patients 
with pSS were studied. The IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7 gene mRNA levels in peripheral
blood cells were calculated by using real-time PCR. The IRF1-positive cells in
the parotid glands with pSS were observed by using immunohistochemistry and
immunofluorescence. Statistical analysis was performed by Student t test.
RESULTS: Compared with 24 control samples, the IRF1 mRNA levels in peripheral
blood cells of 37 cases with pSS were up-regulated (P < .05), but the IRF3 and
IRF7 mRNA levels of pSS were not up-regulated (P > .05). Relative quantitative
levels of IRF1 mRNA were 2.17-fold higher in pSS patients than control subjects. 
The IRF1-positive cells of the pSS group were localized in the epithelial
islands, lymphocytes, and ductal epithelial cells of the parotid glands. In all
control subjects, the IRF1-positive cells were localized only to the ductal
epithelial cells of parotid glands as determined by immunohistochemical staining 
or immunofluorescence. The scores of IRF1-positive cells of pSS were
significantly higher than that of control samples (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that IRF1 mRNA levels are up-regulated in the
peripheral blood cells of pSS patients. Also, IRF1-positive cells exist in the
epithelial islands, lymphocytes, and ductal epithelial cells of the parotid
glands of individuals affected by pSS, but are limited to the ductal epithelial
cells of healthy control subjects.

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family that 
participates in HIV-1 pathogenesis through the depletion of CD4+ T cells. TRAIL
is expressed on the cell membrane of peripheral immune cells and can be cleaved
into a soluble, secreted form. The regulation of TRAIL in macrophages during
HIV-1 infection is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the 
mechanism(s) of TRAIL expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages, an important cell
type in HIV-1 pathogenesis. A human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) culture
system was infected with macrophage-tropic HIV-1(ADA), HIV-1(JR-FL), or
HIV-1(BAL) strains. TRAIL, predominantly the membrane-bound form, increased
following HIV-1 infection. We found that HIV-1 infection also induced interferon 
regulatory factor (IRF)-1, IRF-7 gene expression and signal transducers and
activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation. Small interfering RNA knockdown
of IRF-1 or IRF-7, but not IRF-3, reduced STAT1 activation and TRAIL expression. 
Furthermore, the upregulation of IRF-1, IRF-7, TRAIL, and the activation of STAT1
by HIV-1 infection was reduced by the treatment of type I interferon
(IFN)-neutralizing antibodies. In addition, inhibition of STAT1 by fludarabine
abolished IRF-1, IRF-7, and TRAIL upregulation. We conclude that IRF-1, IRF-7,
type I IFNs, and STAT1 form a signaling feedback loop that is critical in
regulating TRAIL expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages.

Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is still a major problem in organ transplantation,
and its genetic and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used DNA
microarrays to investigate the gene expression profiles in ACR. We hypothesized
that changes of gene expression in grafts could also be detected in peripheral
blood leukocytes. We first compared the gene expression profiles in liver
isografts (Lewis to Lewis) and allografts (Dark Agouti to Lewis) harvested from
rats at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after transplantation. Hierarchical clustering
analysis indicated that gene expression started to change on day 3, and 89
differentially expressed genes were extracted from allografts in comparison with 
isografts at day 3. Most of the up-regulated genes were associated with
graft-infiltrating leukocytes. We then confirmed the similarity of gene
expression changes in peripheral leukocytes by quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction. We also investigated the gene expression changes in other
inflammatory and liver dysfunction models. Two interferon-gamma inducible genes, 
interferon regulatory factor 1 and guanylate nucleotide binding protein 2, were
overexpressed in both the peripheral leukocytes and liver graft during ACR.
Although further studies are necessary, these 2 genes in peripheral leukocytes
could be potentially useful markers for rejection or immunosuppression.

In the present study, we use microarray technology to investigate the expression 
patterns of 381 genes with known association to host immune responses.
Hybridization targets were derived from previously characterized bovine cDNAs. A 
total of 576 reporters (473 sequence-validated cDNAs and 77 controls) were
spotted onto glass slides in two sets of four replicates. Two color, comparative 
hybridizations across both mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and small intestine mucosa
(SIM) RNA samples were done between animals with previously demonstrated
phenotypic differences based on natural exposure to gastrointestinal (GI)
nematodes over a 6-month exposure period. A total of 138 significant
hybridization differences were detected by mixed model analysis of variance. A
subset of these significant differences was validated by quantitative, real-time 
RT-PCR to assay transcript levels for 18 genes. These results confirmed that in
the SIM, susceptible animals showed significantly higher levels in the genes
encoding IGHG1, CD3E, ACTB, IRF1, CCL5 and C3, while in the MLN of resistant
animals, higher levels of expression were confirmed for PTPRC, CD1D and ITGA4.
Combined, the results indicate that immune responses against GI nematode
infections involve multiple response pathways. Higher levels of expression for
IgE receptor, integrins, complement, monocyte/macrophage and tissue factors are
related to resistance. In contrast, higher levels of expression for
immunoglobulin chains and TCRs are related to susceptibility. Identification of
these genes provides a framework to better understand the genetic variation
underlying parasite resistance.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The molecular mechanisms of lymphoproliferation associated
with the disruption of interferon (IFN) signaling and chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection are poorly understood. Lymphomas are extrahepatic manifestations 
of HCV infection; we sought to clarify the molecular mechanisms of these
processes.
METHODS: We established interferon regulatory factor-1-null (irf-1(-/-)) mice
with inducible and persistent expression of HCV structural proteins (irf-1/CN2
mice). All the mice (n = 900) were observed for at least 600 days after Cre/loxP 
switching. Histologic analyses, as well as analyses of lymphoproliferation,
sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis, colony formation, and cytokine production, 
were performed. Proteins associated with these processes were also assessed.
RESULTS: Irf-1/CN2 mice had extremely high incidences of lymphomas and
lymphoproliferative disorders and displayed increased mortality. Disruption of
irf-1 reduced the sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis and decreased the levels
of caspases-3/7 and caspase-9 messenger RNA species and enzymatic activities.
Furthermore, the irf-1/CN2 mice showed decreased activation of caspases-3/7 and
caspase-9 and increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, and Bcl-2, as well
as increased Bcl-2 expression, which promoted oncogenic transformation of
lymphocytes. IL-2 and IL-10 were induced by the HCV core protein in splenocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of IFN signaling resulted in development of lymphoma,
indicating that differential signaling occurs in lymphocytes compared with liver.
This mouse model, in which HCV expression and disruption of IFN signaling
synergize to promote lymphoproliferation, will be an important tool for the
development of therapeutic agents that target the lymphoproliferative pathway.

We previously showed that the tumor suppressor gene REIC/Dkk-3, when
overexpressed by an adenovirus (Ad-REIC), exhibited a dramatic therapeutic effect
on human cancers through a mechanism triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress.
Adenovirus vectors show no target cell specificity and thus may elicit
unfavorable side effects through infection of normal cells even upon
intra-tumoral injection. In this study, we examined possible effects of Ad-REIC
on normal cells. We found that infection of normal human fibroblasts (NHF) did
not cause apoptosis but induced production of interleukin (IL)-7. The induction
was triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress and mediated through IRE1alpha,
ASK1, p38, and IRF-1. When Ad-REIC-infected NHF were transplanted in a mixture
with untreated human prostate cancer cells, the growth of the cancer cells was
significantly suppressed. Injection of an IL-7 antibody partially abrogated the
suppressive effect of Ad-REIC-infected NHF. These results indicate that Ad-REIC
has another arm against human cancer, an indirect host-mediated effect because of
overproduction of IL-7 by mis-targeted NHF, in addition to its direct effect on
cancer cells.

A role for the immune system in controlling the progression of solid tumors has
been established in several mouse models. However, the effect of immune responses
and tumor escape on patient prognosis in the context of human cancer is poorly
understood. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular parameters that could
describe in situ immune responses in human colorectal cancer according to
clinical parameters of metastatic lymph node or distant organ invasion (META- or 
META+ patients). Primary tumor samples of colorectal carcinoma were analyzed by
integrating large-scale phenotypic (flow cytometry, 39 patients) and gene
expression (real time reverse transcription-PCR, 103 patients) data sets related 
to immune and protumoral processes. In META- colorectal cancer primary tumors
with high densities of T cells, we observed significant positive correlations
between markers of innate immune cells [tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic
cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NKT cells] and markers of early-activated T
cells. Significant correlations were also observed between markers of cytotoxic
and effector memory T-cell subpopulations. These correlation profiles were absent
in tumors with low T-cell infiltrates and were altered in META+ tumors with high 
T-cell infiltrates. We show that the coexpression of genes mediating cytotoxicity
(GNLY) and Th1 adaptive immune responses (IRF1) accurately predicted patient
survival independently of the metastatic status. High intratumoral mRNA
expression of the proangiogenic mediator vascular endothelial growth factor was
associated with significantly reduced survival rates in patients expressing high 
mRNA levels of GNLY. Investigation of the colorectal cancer primary tumor
microenvironment allowed us to uncover the association of favorable outcomes with
efficient coordination of the intratumoral immune response.

Physiological changes, elicited in animal immune tissues by exposure to
pathogens, may be studied using functional genomics approaches. We created and
characterized reciprocal suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA
libraries to identify differentially expressed genes in spleen and head kidney
tissues of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) challenged with intraperitoneal injections
of formalin-killed, atypical Aeromonas salmonicida. Of 4,154 ESTs from four cDNA 
libraries, 10 genes with immune-relevant functional annotations were selected for
QPCR studies using individual fish templates to assess biological variability.
Genes confirmed by QPCR as upregulated by A. salmonicida included interleukin-1
beta, interleukin-8, a small inducible cytokine, interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1), ferritin heavy subunit, cathelicidin, and hepcidin. This study is the
first large-scale discovery of bacteria-responsive genes in cod and the first to 
demonstrate upregulation of IRF1 in fish immune tissues as a result of bacterial 
antigen stimulation. Given the importance of IRF1 in vertebrate immune responses 
to viral and bacterial pathogens, the full-length cDNA sequence of Atlantic cod
IRF1 was obtained and compared with putative orthologous sequences from other
organisms. Functional annotations of assembled SSH library ESTs showed that
bacterial antigen stimulation caused changes in many biological processes
including chemotaxis, regulation of apoptosis, antimicrobial peptide production, 
and iron homeostasis. Moreover, differences in spleen and head kidney gene
expression responses to the bacterial antigens pointed to a potential role for
the cod spleen in blood-borne pathogen clearance. Our data show that Atlantic cod
immune tissue responses to bacterial antigens are similar to those seen in other 
fish species and higher vertebrates.

Vaccinia virus (VACV) replicates in mouse and human fibroblasts with comparable
kinetics and efficiency, yielding similar titers of infectious progeny. Here we
demonstrate that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) but not IFN-alpha or IFN-beta
pretreatment of mouse fibroblasts prior to VACV infection induces a long-lasting 
antiviral state blocking VACV replication. In contrast, high doses of IFN-gamma
failed to establish an antiviral state in human fibroblasts. In mouse
fibroblasts, IFN-gamma impeded the viral replication cycle at the level of late
gene transcription and blocked the multiplication of VACV genomes. The
IFN-gamma-induced antiviral state invariably prevented the growth of different
VACV strains but was not effective against the replication of ectromelia virus.
The IFN-gamma effect required intact IFN-gamma receptor signaling prior to VACV
infection through Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1). The permissive state of IFN-gamma-treated human cells
was unrelated to the VACV-encoded IFN decoy receptors B8 and B18 and associated
with a complete disruption of STAT1 homodimer formation and DNA binding. Unlike
human fibroblasts, mouse cells responded with long-lasting STAT1 activation which
was preserved after VACV infection. The deletion of the IFN regulatory factor 1
(IRF-1) gene from mouse cells rescued efficient VACV replication, demonstrating
that IRF-1 target genes have a critical role in VACV control. These data have
implications for the understanding of VACV pathogenesis and identify an
incongruent IFN-gamma response between the human host and the mouse model.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a powerful tool to study DNA looping. The
procedure generates chimeric DNA templates after ligation of restriction enzyme
fragments juxtaposed in vivo by looping. These unique ligation products (ULPs)
are typically quantified by gel-based methods, which are practically inefficient.
Taqman probes may be used, but are expensive. Cycle threshold (Ct) determined
using SYBR Green, an inexpensive alternative, is hampered by non-specific
products and/or background fluorescence, both due to high template/ULP ratio.
SYBR Green melting curve analysis (MCA) is a well-known qualitative tool for
assessing PCR specificity. Here we present for the first time MCA as a
quantitative tool (qMCA) to compare template concentrations across different
samples and apply it to 3C to assess looping among remote elements identified by 
STAT1 and IRF1 ChIP-chip at the interferon-gamma responsive CIITA and SOCS1 loci.
This rapid, inexpensive approach provided highly reproducible identification and 
quantification of ULPs over a significant linear range. Therefore, qMCA is a
robust method to assess chromatin looping in vivo, and overcomes several
drawbacks associated with other approaches. Our data suggest that basal and
induced looping is a involving remote enhancers is a common mechanism at
IFNgamma-regulated targets.

In the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) bearing the t(15;17),
all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment induces granulocytic maturation and
complete remission of leukemia. We identified miR-342 as one of the microRNAs
(miRNAs) upregulated by ATRA during APL differentiation. This miRNA emerged as a 
direct transcriptional target of the critical hematopoietic transcription factors
PU.1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-9. IRF-1 maintains miR-342 
at low levels, whereas the binding of PU.1 and IRF-9 in the promoter region
following retinoic ATRA-mediated differentiation, upregulates miR-342 expression.
Moreover, we showed that enforced expression of miR-342 in APL cells stimulated
ATRA-induced differentiation. These data identified miR-342 as a new player in
the granulocytic differentiation program activated by ATRA in APL.

Toll-like receptors: a family of innate sensors of danger that alert and drive
immunity.

Montero Vega MT(1), de Andrés Martín A.

The innate immune system possesses a network of germline-encoded receptors that
recognize microbial molecular motifs and endogenous molecules produced by injured
tissues and set in motion a defensive response which adapts to the damage that
has occurred. This network includes Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of
transmembrane receptors that recognize a wide spectrum of ligands at the cell
surface and in the lumen of intracellular vesicles. Recognition of ligands by
TLRs induces the recruitment of different cytoplasmic adaptor molecules and
initiates signalling pathways which ultimately lead to the activation of
transcriptional factors such as NF-kappaB , IRF1/3/5/7, or AP-1. These factors
are involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, type I
interferons, co-stimulatory molecules, and other factors of the effector
response. TLRs regulate many aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity. To
prevent an inappropriate or an overactive immune response, a complex network of
molecules negatively regulates TLRs and their associated signalling pathways.
TLRs are currently viewed as important targets for the development of new
vaccines and innovative therapies which may help prevent or treat disorders such 
as cancer, allergy, autoimmunity, obesity, atherosclerosis, and other
inflammatory diseases.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF-1) is a member of the IRF family of
transcription factors, which have key and diverse roles in the gene-regulatory
networks of the immune system. IRF-1 has been described as a critical mediator of
IFN-gamma signalling and as the major player in driving TH1 type responses. It is
therefore likely to be crucial in both innate and adaptive responses against
intracellular pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum. Polymorphisms at the human
IRF1 locus have been previously found to be associated with the ability to
control P. falciparum infection in populations naturally exposed to malaria. In
order to test whether genetic variation at the IRF1 locus also affects the risk
of developing severe malaria, we performed a family-based test of association for
18 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the gene in three African
populations, using genotype data from 961 trios consisting of one affected child 
and his/her two parents (555 from The Gambia, 204 from Kenya and 202 from
Malawi). No significant association with severe malaria or severe malaria
subphenotypes (cerebral malaria and severe malaria anaemia) was observed for any 
of the SNPs/haplotypes tested in any of the study populations. Our results offer 
no evidence that the molecular pathways regulated by the transcription factor
IRF-1 are involved in the immune-based pathogenesis of severe malaria.

IRF1 is a transcription factor that regulates key processes in the immune system 
and in tumour suppression. To gain further insight into IRF1's role in these
processes, we searched for new target genes by performing chromatin
immunoprecipitation coupled to a CpG island microarray (ChIP-chip). Using this
approach we identified 202 new IRF1-binding sites with high confidence.
Functional categorization of the target genes revealed a surprising cadre of new 
roles that can be linked to IRF1. One of the major functional categories was the 
DNA damage response pathway. In order to further validate our findings, we show
that IRF1 can regulate the mRNA expression of a number of the DNA damage response
genes in our list. In particular, we demonstrate that the mRNA and protein levels
of the DNA repair protein BRIP1 [Fanconi anemia gene J (FANC J)] are upregulated 
after IRF1 over-expression. We also demonstrate that knockdown of IRF1 by siRNA
results in loss of BRIP1 expression, abrogation of BRIP1 foci after DNA
interstrand crosslink (ICL) damage and hypersensitivity to the DNA crosslinking
agent, melphalan; a characteristic phenotype of FANC J cells. Taken together, our
data provides a more complete understanding of the regulatory networks controlled
by IRF1 and reveals a novel role for IRF1 in regulating the ICL DNA damage
response.

Radiation-induced cathepsin S is involved in radioresistance.

Seo HR(1), Bae S, Lee YS.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Radiation Effect, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical
Sciences, Seoul, Korea.

Previous studies have suggested that the production of cathepsin S (CatS), a
cysteine protease, was specifically induced in radiation-induced rat mammary
tumors. In this study, we further investigate the mechanism by which CatS is
induced by radiation and its function. Radiation induced production of CatS at
both the mRNA and protein level, and increased its protease activity. In
addition, these radiation induced changes occurred in a dose and time-dependent
fashion. Agents such as bleomycin, As(2)O(3) and H(2)O(2), which produce reactive
oxygen species (ROS), also induced CatS expression; however, other agents that
damage DNA such as taxol and cisplatin did not. Additionally, treatment of the
cells with the ROS scavengers, N-acetylcysteine and catalase, inhibited the
radiation induced CatS expression. Furthermore, radiation-induced ROS was also
involved in IFN-gamma production, which was responsible for radiation-mediated
CatS expression. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) data
obtained using an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) oligonucleotide revealed
that IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) was the critical transcriptional mediator of 
IFN-gamma-dependent CatS production after radiation. Finally, CatS overespression
was found to induce radioresistance; however, knockdown of CatS resulted in the
suppression of radioresistance. Taken together, the results of this study
indicate that radiation induced CatS expression via ROS-IFN-gamma pathways, and
that this increased expression may be involved in radioresistance.

quantitated by FACS analysis (Propidiumiodide/AnnexinV staining). Gene expression
was analysed by RNA-Microarray and the results validated for selected genes by
rtPCR. Protein level changes were documented by Western Blot analysis. NFKB
activity was analysed by ELISA and proliferation assays (BrdU) were performed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The single substances TRAIL and TRD induced apoptotic
cell death and decreased proliferation in HT1080 cells significantly. Gene
expression of several genes related to apoptotic pathways (TRAIL: ARHGDIA,
NFKBIA, TNFAIP3; TRD: HSPA1A/B, NFKBIA, GADD45A, SGK, JUN, MAP3K14) was changed. 
The combination of TRD and TRAIL significantly increased apoptotic cell death
compared to the single substances and lead to expression changes in a variety of 
genes (HSPA1A/B, NFKBIA, PPP1R15A, GADD45A, AXL, SGK, DUSP1, JUN, IRF1, MYC,
BAG5, BIRC3). NFKB activity assay revealed an antipodal regulation of the several
subunits of NFKB by TRD and TRD+TRAIL compared to TRAIL alone.
CONCLUSION: TRD and TRAIL are effective to induce apoptosis and decrease
proliferation in human fibrosarcoma. A variety of genes seems to be involved,
pointing to the NFKB pathway as key regulator in TRD/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Interferons-alpha/beta, which are produced upon viral infection, are key soluble 
factors for the establishment of an antiviral state, but are also produced at low
levels in the absence of infection. Herein, we demonstrate that a weak signal by 
these constitutively produced IFN-alpha/beta show a preventive role in cellular
transformation. Ifnar1-deficient (Ifnar1(-/-)) MEF, which are devoid of
IFN-alpha/beta signal, undergo a spontaneous transformation during long-term cell
culture. Similar to Irf1(-/-) MEF, primary Ifnar1(-/-) MEF become tumorigenic in 
nude mice by the expression of activated c-Ha-Ras oncoprotein. However,
Ifnar1(-/-) MEF do not show any abnormal growth properties. A similar observation
is made in Ifnb(-/-) MEF that fail to produce constitutive IFN-alpha/beta,
whereas such a transforming property is not found in MEF that lack any of the IFN
receptor downstream molecules including Stat1, IRF9 and IRF1. Furthermore,
Ifnar1(-/-) mice develop chemically-induced skin papilloma more severely than
wild-type mice. In addition, the expression levels of IFNAR1 mRNA are
significantly decreased in human gastric cancer tissues. These results suggest a 
cell-intrinsic role of the weak signal by constitutively produced IFN-alpha/beta 
to prevent cells from transformation, which may be mediated by a hitherto-unknown
pathway(s) downstream of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor.

Molecular classification of spontaneous endometrial adenocarcinomas in BDII rats.

University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Academy, SE 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.

Female rats of the BDII/Han inbred strain are prone to spontaneously develop
endometrial carcinomas (EC) that in cell biology and pathogenesis are very
similar to those of human. Human EC are classified into two major groups: Type I 
displays endometroid histology, is hormone-dependent, and characterized by
frequent microsatellite instability and PTEN, K-RAS, and CTNNB1 (beta-Catenin)
mutations; Type II shows non-endometrioid histology, is hormone-unrelated,
displays recurrent TP53 mutation, CDKN2A (P16) inactivation, over-expression of
ERBB2 (Her2/neu), and reduced CDH1 (Cadherin 1 or E-Cadherin) expression.
However, many human EC have overlapping clinical, morphologic,
immunohistochemical, and molecular features of types I and II. The EC developed
in BDII rats can be related to type I tumors, since they are hormone-related and 
histologically from endometrioid type. Here, we combined gene sequencing (Pten,
Ifr1, and Ctnnb1) and real-time gene expression analysis (Pten, Cdh1, P16, Erbb2,
Ctnnb1, Tp53, and Irf1) to further characterize molecular alterations in this
tumor model with respect to different subtypes of EC in humans. No mutation in
Pten and Ctnnb1 was detected, whereas three tumors displayed sequence aberrations
of the Irf1 gene. Significant down regulation of Pten, Cdh1, p16, Erbb2, and
Ctnnb1 gene products was found in the tumors. In conclusion, our data suggest
that molecular features of spontaneous EC in BDII rats can be related to
higher-grade human type I tumors and thus, this model represents an excellent
experimental tool for research on this malignancy in human.

c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) upregulates XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1)
through interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in gastrointestinal cancer.

University, Guangzhou, China. jidewang@gmail.com

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein-associated factor 1 
(XAF1) is a tumor suppressor that can sensitize cancer cell to apoptosis.
Intrinsic expression of XAF1 in cancer cell is low. Our purpose is to determine
the effect of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) on XAF1 expression and the
putative mechanism.
METHODS: XAF1 expression in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cell line AGS and SW1116
was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time 
PCR and immunoblotting. The role of JNK1 was assessed by ectopic overexpression
with wild-type (JNK1-WT) and dominant-negative (JNK1-DN) JNK1 constructs. The
effects of JNK1 activator, interferon (IFN)-alpha, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-alpha and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), or JNK1 inhibitor,
SP600125, were evaluated. An XAF1 promoter reporter pLUC107 with WT or mutated
interferon regulatory factor 1-binding element (IRF-E) was used to assess
JNK1-induced transcription by dual luciferase assay.
RESULT: Ectopic overexpression of JNK1-WT or treatment with IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha 
and PMA induced whereas SP600125 suppressed intrinsic and induced XAF1
expression. Induction of XAF1 required de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, JNK1 
stimulated whereas SP600125 suppressed XAF1 promoter activity. JNK1 stimulated
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) expression, whereas both IRF-1
small-interfering RNA and site mutation of IRF-E within XAF1 promoter abrogated
the effect of JNK1.
CONCLUSION: JNK1 stimulated and mediated the effects of IFN and TNF-alpha on XAF1
expression through transcriptional regulation by induction of IRF-1. The linkage 
of JNK1, IRF-1 and XAF1 in the same signal pathway may unravel a novel mechanism 
in regulation of apoptosis and differentiation of GI cancers.

Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. xitong@liai.org

L-selectin mediates the initial tethering and rolling of lymphocytes in high
endothelial venules. To study the transcriptional regulation of mouse L-selectin,
we cloned 4.5 kb 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse sell. Luciferase analysis of 
serial 5'-deletion mutants showed that the first 285 bp was sufficient to drive
high promoter activity in EL4 cells, but not in Sell-negative HeLa cells,
suggesting that this fragment harbors the minimal mouse sell promoter and
contains cis-elements for lymphocyte-specific expression. Site-directed
mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Mzf1, Klf2, Sp1, Ets1, 
and Irf1 bind to and activate the mouse sell promoter. Over expression of these
transcription factors in EL4 cells increased expression of sell mRNA. Silencing
the expression of Sp1 by siRNA significantly decreased sell promoter activity in 
EL4 cells. We conclude that sell transcription is regulated by Mzf1, Klf2, Sp1,
Ets1, and Irf1.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 is a transcription factor involved in initiating a
vigorous Th1 response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Therefore, we 
considered it as a possible candidate gene for certain polymorphisms to confer
susceptibility to develop clinical tuberculosis. However, all polymorphisms with 
minor allele frequencies higher than 5% and haplotype frequencies in two
Southeast Asian populations (Indonesian and Vietnamese) turned out not to be
associated with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) is expressed in the ovine uterus and
functions as a transcriptional activator.

Interferon tau (IFNT), the maternal recognition of pregnancy signal in sheep and 
other ruminants, is secreted by the conceptus and regulates the expression of a
number of genes in a cell-specific manner within the uterus. The response of
different endometrial cell types to IFNT appears to be specified by IFN
regulatory factors (IRFs). IRF2, a potent repressor of gene transcription, is
expressed only by luminal (LE) and superficial glandular epithelia (sGE), whereas
IRF1 and IRF9, activators of gene transcription, are expressed only in GE and
stromal cells of the uterus during early pregnancy. In the present study, IRF6
was found to be expressed in LE/sGE and middle GE of the ovine uterine
endometrium as well as conceptus trophectoderm. IRF family members can regulate
transcription via IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). Transient
transfection analyses found that IRF6 enhanced basal activity of ISRE-containing 
promoters, but did not enhance IFNT stimulation of ISRE-containing promoters in
variety of different cell types. Further, IRF6 did not cooperate with IRF1 or
reduce IRF2 repression of ISRE-containing promoter activity. These results
establish that IRF6 is a transcriptional activator that is preferentially
expressed in the endometrial epithelia and conceptus trophectoderm. IRF6 is
hypothesized to play critical roles in endometrial gene expression as well as in 
conceptus trophectoderm growth and differentiation.

Differential gene signatures in rat mammary tumors induced by DMBA and those
induced by fractionated gamma radiation.

(1)Division of Radiation Effect, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical
Sciences, Seoul, Korea.

The aim of this work was to identify specific genes involved in rat mammary
tumors induced by dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) or radiation. More TUNEL- and 
PCNA-positive cells were present in mammary tumors induced by radiation than in
tumors induced by DMBA, whereas DNA damage responses like p53 accumulation and
histone H2AX phosphorylation were higher in DMBA-induced tumors, even though the 
pathology was similar in both types of tumors. cDNA microarray and real-time
RT-PCR analysis of radiation- or DMBA-induced tumor tissues, revealed that
stanniocalcin 2 (Stc2), interferon regulatory factor 1 (Irf1), interleukin 18
binding protein (Il18bp), and chloride channel calcium activated 3 (Clca3) were
expressed in both, and that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein 1
(Alox5ap) and cathepsin S (Ctss) were expressed only in radiation-induced tumors.
No DMBA-specific gene signatures were found. Soft agar growth assays were carried
out to identify the carcinogenic features of these specific genes. Cells stably
transfected with Alox5ap, Ctss, Stc2, Irf1, Il18bp and Clca3 showed morphological
changes compared to controls. These findings indicate different gene alterations 
in carcinogen- or radiation-induced mammary tumors with similar pathological
stages.

Ubc9-mediated sumoylation leads to transcriptional repression of IRF-1.

Kim EJ(1), Park JS, Um SJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Dankook University, Gyeonggi-do 448-701,
Republic of Korea.

To characterize the regulatory mechanism of the interferon regulatory factor
(IRF) family, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with IRF-2 and isolated the
small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which also
interacts with other IRF family members IRF-1 and ICSBP. Subsequent assays
indicated that among the IRF family members, only IRF-1 interacts with SUMO-1
through its transcriptional activation domain. The interaction between IRF-1 and 
SUMO-1 was confirmed in vitro by GST pull-down assays and in vivo by
co-localization assays. Furthermore, this interaction led to the Ubc9-mediated
sumoylation of IRF-1 in vitro and in vivo. Transient transfection assays revealed
that Ubc9 or SUMO inhibits the transcriptional activity of IRF-1 in a
dose-dependent manner. Finally, Ubc9 and SUMO cooperate in the transcriptional
repression of IRF-1. Taken together, these observations suggest that Ubc9
functions as a transcriptional repressor of IRF-1 by inducing sumoylation, and
that this effect may be required for the physiological activity of IRF-1.

In order to clarify the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on natural killer (NK)
cells and the possibly regulatory mechanisms, we obtained highly purified and
viable NK cells from C57BL/6J mouse spleen by a magnetic cell sorter (MACS).
These cells were treated with E2 and then their cytotoxicity and proliferative
capacity were examined. To further investigate the mechanisms on the effect of E2
on NK cells, expressions of activation-associated markers (CD69, CD122) and
inhibitory receptors (CD94, Ly49), and intracellular cytokine production were
analyzed. At last, we performed the cDNA microarray to explore the possible
involved genes. We found that E2 could suppress NK cell cytotoxicity and
proliferative capacity in vitro. E2 reduced NK cell cytotoxicity and
proliferative capacity, which may be through influencing the phenotypes and
cytokine expression of NK cells, mainly involving CD94 and IFN-gamma.
Furthermore, regulation of Stat4, Fyn, Sh2d1a, Eat2, Cd244, Irf1, Runx1, Irf7,
Irf5, Esrra and Nr5a1 genes may be related to the cytotoxicity, proliferation and
cytokine production of E2-mediated purified NK cells.

Epigenetic silencing of the interferon regulatory factor ICSBP/IRF8 in human
multiple myeloma.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, 
Uppsala, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is presently an incurable malignant plasma cell 
tumor. The objective of this study was to investigate expression of the
interferon regulatory factor family (IRF1-9) and the potential role of DNA
methylation in silencing IRF genes in MM cell lines and purified MM cells from
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a panel of 13 human MM cell lines and purified
CD138+ cells from nine MM patients, expression of IRF genes was investigated by
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.
DNA methylation of the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8)
gene was measured using pyrosequencing, and the effect of promoter methylation on
expression was analyzed by in vitro methylation of a cloned ICSBP/IRF8 promoter, 
and treatment of MM cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC).
RESULTS: Eight of thirteen of the MM cell lines were found to lack ICSBP/IRF8
expression, associated with hypermethylation of the CpG island in the ICSBP/IRF8 
promoter. We also found that ICSBP/IRF8 was significantly underexpressed in
primary MM cells, whereas the ICSBP/IRF8 promoter was methylated in only one of
nine of primary purified CD138+ MM samples. DAC-mediated demethylation restored
endogenous ICSBP/IRF8 expression, whereas in vitro methylation silenced the
promoter.
CONCLUSION: Expression of the ICSBP/IRF8 gene is silenced in a majority of MM
cell lines and primary CD138+ MM cells. DNA methylation of the ICSBP/IRF8 gene is
a frequent event in MM cell lines, but silencing is also observed in the absence 
of methylation. These results suggest that silencing of ICSBP/IRF8 expression, by
DNA methylation or other epigenetic mechanisms, may be associated with the
malignant phenotype of MM.

OBJECTIVE: To establish a nude mouse model of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
lymph node metastasis and screen the signature genes associated with the
metastasis.
METHODS: The NPC 5-8F-EGFP cells were inoculated into nude mice, from which a
5-8F-LN cell line with lymph node metastasis potential was obtained. The
lymphatic metastasis-related signature genes of breast cancer and head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma were screened by data mining method.
RESULTS: The NPC cell lines 5-8F and 6-10B showed 307 differentially expressed
genes by microarray analysis, from which 20 overlapping genes were identified,
and 3 overexpressed genes were found with probable metastasis potential, namely
the ADM, IRF1, and CAV1 genes. Quantitative RT-PCR validated the data mining
results in the 5-8F-EGFP, 6-10B-EGFP, NP69, and 5-8F-LN cell lines. The 3 NPC
cell lines 5-8F-EGFP, 6-10B-EGFP and 5-8F-LN showed significantly higher
expressions of IRF1 than NP69 cells (P=0.008, 0.022, and 0.006, respectively. The
expression level of CAV1 in 5-8F-EGFP cells was significantly higher than that in
6-10B-EGFP cells (P=0.014), but ADM expression showed no significant difference
between the 4 cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF1 may play an important role in the progression of NPC. The
overexpression of CAV1 in 5-8F-EGFP cells can be associated with the high
metastatic potential of the cells.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) represent the 2 most
common types of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Both derive from keratinocytes but show 
a distinct biological behavior. Here we present transcriptional profiling data of
a large cohort of tumor patients (SCC, n = 42; BCC, n = 114). Differentially
expressed genes reflect known features of SCC and BCC including the typical
cytokeratin pattern as well as upregulation of characteristic cell proliferation 
genes. Additionally, we found increased expression of interferon (IFN)-regulated 
genes (including IFI27, IFI30, Mx1, IRF1 and CXCL9) in SCC, and to a lower extent
in BCC. The expression of IFN-regulated genes correlated with the extent of the
lesional immune-cell infiltrate. Immunohistological examinations confirmed the
expression of IFN-regulated genes in association with a CXCR3+ cytotoxic
inflammatory infiltrate on the protein level. Of note, a small subset of SCC
samples with low expression of IFN-regulated genes included most organ transplant
recipients receiving immunosuppressive medication. Collectively, our findings
support the concept that IFN-associated host responses play an important role in 
tumor immunosurveillance in the skin.

Poland. jaroslaw.smieja@polsl.pl

MOTIVATION: Interferon-beta induced JAK-STAT signaling pathways contribute to
mucosal immune recognition and an anti-viral state. Though the main molecular
mechanisms constituting these pathways are known, neither the detailed structure 
of the regulatory network, nor its dynamics has yet been investigated. The
objective of this work is to build a mathematical model for the pathway that
would serve two purposes: (1) to reproduce experimental results in simulation of 
both early and late response to Interferon-beta stimulation and (2) to explain
experimental phenomena generating new hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms that
cannot yet be tested experimentally.
RESULTS: Experimentally determined time dependent changes in the major components
of this pathway were used to build a mathematical model describing pathway
dynamics in the form of ordinary differential equations. The experimental results
suggested existence of unknown negative control mechanisms that were tested
numerically using the model. Together, experimental and numerical data show that 
the epithelial JAK-STAT pathway might be subjected to previously unknown dynamic 
negative control mechanisms: (1) activation of dormant phosphatases and (2)
inhibition of nuclear import of IRF1.

FOXA1 and IRF-1 intermediary transcriptional regulators of PPARgamma-induced
urothelial cytodifferentiation.

Author information: 
(1)Jack Birch Unit of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Department of Biology, University
of York, York YO10 5YW, UK.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a
ligand-activated transcription factor that has been implicated in the induction
of differentiation of various cell types, including human uroepithelial cells.
PPARgamma-mediated differentiation of normal human urothelial (NHU) cells in
vitro requires coinhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling
and is characterised by de novo expression of late/terminal
differentiation-associated genes, including uroplakins (UPK), over a 6-day
period. We used gene microarrays to identify intermediary transcription factors
induced in direct response to PPARgamma activation of EGFR-inhibited NHU cells.
FOXA1 and IRF-1 contained consensus cognate binding sites in UPK1a, UPK2, and
UPK3a promoters and transcripts were induced within 12 h of PPARgamma activation;
transcription complex formation was confirmed by electromobility shift assays. In
urothelium in situ, both FOXA1 and IRF-1 were nuclear and expressed in a
differentiation-associated pattern. Knockdown by transient siRNA of either FOXA1 
or IRF-1 abrogated PPARgamma-induced uroplakin expression in vitro. This is the
first evidence that ligand activation of PPARgamma induces expression of
intermediary transcription factors that mediate an epithelial differentiation
programme and represents a new paradigm for understanding differentiation,
regenerative repair and inflammation in epithelial tissues.

Regulation of STAT pathways and IRF1 during human dendritic cell maturation by
TNF-alpha and PGE2.

York, New York, USA.

Maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) by TLR ligands induces expression of IFN-beta
and autocrine activation of IFN-inducible Stat1-dependent genes important for DC 
function. In this study, we analyzed the regulation of STAT signaling during
maturation of human DCs by TNF-alpha and PGE2, which induced maturation of human 
DCs comparably with LPS but did not induce detectable IFN-beta production or
Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with these results, TNF-alpha and PGE2
did not induce Stat1 DNA binding to a standard Stat1-binding oligonucleotide.
Instead, TNF-alpha and PGE2 increased Stat1 serine phosphorylation and Stat4
tyrosine phosphorylation and activated expression of the NF-kappaB and Stat1
target gene IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which contributes to IFN responses.
TNF-alpha and PGE2 induced a complex that bound an oligonucleotide derived from
the IRF1 promoter that contains a STAT-binding sequence embedded in a larger
palindromic sequence, and this complex was recognized by Stat1 antibodies. These 
results suggest that TNF-alpha and PGE2 activate STAT-mediated components of
human DC maturation by alternative pathways to the IFN-beta-mediated autocrine
loop used by TLRs.

for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We showed for the first time that the
metabolic syndrome is associated with a higher fraction of oxidized LDL and thus 
with higher levels of circulating oxidized LDL. Hyperinsulinemia and impaired
glycaemic control, independent of lipid levels, were associated with increased in
vivo LDL oxidation, as reflected by the higher prevalence of high oxidized LDL.
High levels of oxidized LDL were associated with increased risk of future
myocardial infarction, even after adjustment for LDL-cholesterol and other
established cardiovascular risk factors. This association is in agreement with
the finding that accumulation of oxidized LDL, which activates/induces subsets of
smooth muscle cells and macrophages to gelatinase production, was associated with
upstream localization of a vulnerable plaque phenotype. Dyslipidemia and insulin 
resistance in obese LDL receptor-deficient mice were associated with increased
oxidative stress and impaired HDL-associated antioxidant defence associated with 
accelerated atherosclerosis due to increased macrophage infiltration and
accumulation of oxidized LDL in the aorta. The accumulation of oxidized LDL was
partly due to an impaired HDL-associated antioxidant defence due to a decrease in
PON. Our data in this experimental model are thus the more relevant because a
decrease in PON activity was found to be associated with a defective metabolism
of oxidized phospholipids by HDL from patients with type 2 diabetes. Weight loss 
in leptin-deficient, obese, and insulin-resistant mice was associated with
expressional changes of key genes regulating adipocyte differentiation, glucose
transport and insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and
inflammation, most of which are under the transcriptional control of PPARs. We
established an important relationship between PPAR-gamma and SOD1 for the
prevention of the oxidation of LDL in the arterial wall. For example we showed
that rosuvastatin decreased the oxidized LDL accumulation by increasing the
expression of PPAR-gamma and SOD1. In addition, we established a relation between
increased PPAR-alpha expression in the adipose tissue and a change in the gene
expression pattern, which explains the decrease of free fatty acids,
triglycerides and the increase in insulin sensitivity. We demonstrated that
plaque oxidized LDL correlated with coronary plaque complexity in a swine
atherosclerosis model. Oxidized LDL correlated positively with the expression of 
IRF1 and TLR2 suggesting a relation between oxidative stress and inflammation in 
coronary atherosclerotic plaques. Oxidized LDL induced further the expression of 
TLR2 and IRF1 in macrophages in vitro suggesting a causative link. As in the
mouse model described above, plaque oxidized LDL correlated negatively with SOD1 
expression and ox-LDL inhibited the expression of SOD1 in macrophages in vitro.
We showed that TLR2, CXCR4 and MYC are overexpressed in monocytes of obese women 
at high cardiovascular risk and that weight loss was associated with a
concomitant decrease of their expression. This suggests that the transcription
factor cMYC has an atherogenic effect by inducing pro-inflammatory genes. The
increased expression of TLR2 and CXCR4 were observed in the absence of an
increase in ox-LDL but in the presence of an increase in SOD1. Interestingly, the
expression of SOD1 correlated also with that of MYC, suggesting that it has an
atherogenic effect by inducing the expression of an anti-oxidant enzyme. How
ox-LDL prevents this increase remains to be determined. How we plan to do this is
explained in the next part. In aggregate, our studies contributed to a better
understanding of the relationships between metabolic syndrome, insulin
signalling, oxidative stress and inflammation and atherosclerosis. We identified 
paraoxonase, interferon regulatory factor-1, toll-like receptors, CXCR4 and SOD1 
as possible targets for intervention.

SLC26A6 (putative anion transporter 1, PAT1) has been shown to play an important 
role in mediating the luminal Cl(-)/OH(-)(HCO(3)(-)) exchange process in the
intestine. Very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the
transcriptional regulation of intestinal SLC26A6 gene expression in the
intestine. Current studies were, therefore, designed to clone and characterize
the 5'-regulatory region of the human SLC26A6 gene and determine the mechanisms
involved in its regulation. A 1,120 bp (p-964/+156) SLC26A6 promoter fragment
cloned upstream to the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-basic exhibited high
promoter activity when transfected in Caco2 cells. Progressive deletions of the
5'-flanking region demonstrated that -214/-44 region of the promoter harbors
cis-acting elements important for maximal SLC26A6 promoter activity. Since,
diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel diseases is attributed to increased
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we examined the effects of IFNgamma (30 
ng/ml, 24 h) on SLC26A6 function, expression and promoter activity. IFNgamma
decreased both SLC26A6 mRNA and function and repressed SLC26A6 promoter activity.
Deletion analysis indicated that IFNgamma response element is located between
-414/-214 region and sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of
potential Interferon Stimulated Responsive Element (ISRE), a binding site
(-318/-300 bp) for interferon regulatory factor-1 transcription factor (IRF-1).
Mutations in the potential ISRE site abrogated the inhibitory effects of
IFNgamma. These studies provided novel evidence for the involvement of IRF-1 in
the regulation of SLC26A6 gene expression by IFNgamma in the human intestine.

Both type I interferons (IFNs) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are well 
characterized in viral infections, whereas they are far less studied in
bacterially activated toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. Here, we studied the
involvement of IRF1 and IRF2 in TLR2-mediated responses. In mouse macrophages,
IRF2 was activated by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of Staphylococcus aureus, resulting
in up-regulation of IRF1 and rapid secretion of IFN-alpha. In addition,
LTA-induced activation of Signal transducers and activators of transcription 1
(Stat1) and Stat3 via IRF2. The secretion of IFN-alpha was reduced in
IRF2-silenced macrophages, resulting in a disappearance of
tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 and a reduction of pro-inflammatory responses,
despite induction of Mal adapter protein. These results provide a mechanistic
insight into the pro-inflammatory responses against S. aureus LTA in mouse
macrophages. IRFs can be intersecting factors of viral and bacterial responses in
activated TLR signalling pathways.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 and its functional antagonist IRF2 were
originally discovered as transcription factors that regulate the interferon-beta 
gene. Control of cell growth has led to the definition of IRF1 as a tumour
suppressor gene and IRF2 as an oncogene. Clinically, approximately 70% of cases
of acute myeloid leukaemia demonstrate dysregulated expression of IRF1 and/or
IRF2. Our previous studies have shown that human leukaemic TF-1 cells exhibit
abnormally high expression of both IRF1 and IRF2, the latter acting to abrogate
IRF1 tumour suppression, making these cells ideal for analysis of down-regulation
of IRF2 expression. A novel G418 screening protocol was developed and used for
identifying effective siRNA that targets IRF2 (siIRF2). Using optimized siIRF2 in
leukaemic TF-1 cells, IRF2 was down-regulated by approximately 70% at both mRNA
and protein levels. Phenotypically, this resulted in growth inhibition associated
with G2/M arrest as well as induction of polyploidy, differentiation and
apoptosis. In contrast to these results, siIRF2 targeting did not affect normal
haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell growth. These results indicate the potential 
utility of IRF2 inhibition as a therapeutic approach to cancer.

Dendritic cell-derived interferon-gamma-induced protein mediates tumor necrosis
factor-alpha stimulation of human lung fibroblasts.

Lung fibroblast plays a pivotal role in lung repair and remodeling, and also
contributes to lung inflammation. The present study investigated differential
protein profiling of normal human lung fibroblasts stimulated with tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-alpha. Total proteins from lung fibroblasts were separated by 2-DE, 
and differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. TNF-alpha 
was found for the first time to alter the expression levels of myxovirus
resistance protein A, interferon-stimulated gene 15, plasminogen activator
inhibitor-2, lysyl hydroxylase 2 (isoform a), and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (alpha
subunit) in human lung fibroblasts. In particular, dendritic cell-derived
interferon-gamma-induced protein (DCIP) was upregulated by TNF-alpha in lung
fibroblasts and its biological function is at present unknown. We found that
TNF-alpha-induced DCIP expression was dependent on the transcription factor
interferon regulatory factor-1. DCIP-selective antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha-responsive gene targets including vascular 
cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10,
and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. In a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung
injury mouse model, DCIP mRNA level was elevated together with that of TNF-alpha.
We have demonstrated for the first time that DCIP is upregulated by TNF-alpha and
also mediates TNF-alpha stimulation of human lung fibroblasts. Further studies on
the role of DCIP in airway inflammation and remodeling are warranted.

Regulation of IRF2 transcriptional activity by its sumoylation.

Han KJ(1), Jiang L, Shu HB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver,
CO 80206, USA.

IRFs constitute a family of transcription factors involved in IFN signaling and
in the development and differentiation of the immune system. IRFs activities are 
regulated at transcriptional level (such as IRF1) and post-translational
modifications (such as IRF3 and IRF7). Here we show that IRF2 interacts with the 
SUMO-E3 ligase PIASy and is sumoylated in vivo. Mutagenesis analysis suggests
that IRF2 contains three sumoylation sites. Sumoylation of IRF2 has no
significant effects on its nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity, but
increases its ability to inhibit IRF1 transcriptional activity and decreases its 
ability to activate the ISRE and H4 promoters. Our findings suggest that
sumoylation of IRF2 regulates its transcriptional activities.

The chromatin-remodeling enzyme BRG1 coordinates CIITA induction through many
interdependent distal enhancers.

Comment in
    Nat Immunol. 2008 Jul;9(7):713-4.

The chromatin-remodeling enzyme BRG1 is critical for interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma)-mediated gene induction. Promoter-proximal elements are sufficient to
mediate BRG1 dependency at some IFN-gamma targets. In contrast, we show here that
at CIITA, which encodes the 'master regulator' of induction of major
histocompatibility complex class II, distal elements conferred BRG1 dependency.
At the uninduced locus, many sites formed BRG1-independent loops. One loop
juxtaposed a far downstream element adjacent to a far upstream site. Notably,
BRG1 was recruited to the latter site, which triggered the appearance of a
histone 'mark' linked to activation. This subtle change was crucial, as
subsequent IFN-gamma-induced recruitment of the transcription factors STAT1, IRF1
and p300, as well as histone modifications, accessibility and additional loops,
showed BRG1 dependency. Like BRG1, each remote element was critical for the
induction of CIITA expression. Thus, BRG1 regulates CIITA through many
interdependent remote enhancers, not through the promoter alone.

IRF-1 promotes apoptosis in p53-damaged basal-type human mammary epithelial
cells: a model for early basal-type mammary carcinogenesis.

Bowie ML(1), Ibarra C, Seewalt VL.

Author information: 
(1)Duke University Cancer Center, Durham, NC, USA.

Mammary gland homeostasis is regulated by both endogenous and exogenous signals, 
creating a balance between proliferation and apoptosis. It is thought that breast
cancer develops from the acquisition of multiple genetic changes. The function of
tumor suppressor p53 is fequently lost in cancers; however, not all cells that
lose p53 progress to become invasive cancer. We have developed a model of early
mammary carcinogenesis to investigate some of the internal and external signaling
pathways that target the elimination ot normal basal-type human mammary
epithelial cells (HMECs) that acutely acquire p53-damage. Here, we show that both
tamoxifen (Tam) and three-dimensional prepared extracellular matrix culture (3-D 
rECM) induce apoptosis in HMEC cells with acute loss of p53 [*p53(-) HMECs]
through induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Tam and rECM
signaling in *p53(-) HMECs (1) promotes the recruitment of a STAT1/ CBP complex
to the IRF-1 promoter, (2) upregulates IRF-1, (3) activates caspase-1 and -3, and
(4) induces apoptosis. Suppression of IRF-1 with siRNA oligos inhibited both Tam-
and rECM-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that IRF-1 plays a
critical role in eliminating p53-damaged cells, and may play a more global role
in mammary gland homeostasis.

Anthrax lethal toxin enhances TNF-induced endothelial VCAM-1 expression via an
IFN regulatory factor-1-dependent mechanism.

Warfel JM(1), D'Agnillo F.

Bethesda, MD 20892.

Impaired host defenses and vascular dysfunction are hallmarks of the late,
antibiotic-refractory stages of systemic anthrax infection. Anthrax lethal toxin 
(LT), a key virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, was previously shown to
enhance VCAM-1 expression on primary human endothelial cells suggesting a
causative link between dysregulated adhesion molecule expression and the poor
immune response and vasculitis associated with anthrax. In this study, we report 
that LT amplification of TNF-induced VCAM-1 expression is driven
transcriptionally by the cooperative activation of NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1). LT enhancement of NF-kappaB phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation correlated temporally with a delayed reaccumulation of
IkappaBalpha, while increased induction of IRF-1 was linked to STAT1 activation. 
LT failed to augment TNF-induced ICAM-1 or E-selectin expression, two adhesion
molecules regulated by NF-kappaB, but not IRF-1. These results suggest that LT
can differentially modulate NF-kappaB target genes and highlight the importance
of IRF-1 in VCAM-1 enhancement. Altering the activity of key transcription
factors involved in host response to infection may be a critical mechanism by
which LT contributes to anthrax pathogenesis.

iNOS expression requires NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling in microvascular
endothelial cells.

Wu F(1), Tyml K, Wilson JX.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo,
New York 14121-8028, USA.

Redox regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression was
investigated in lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma (LPS +
IFNgamma)-stimulated microvascular endothelial cells from mouse skeletal muscle. 
Unstimulated endothelial cells produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive
to inhibition of NADPH oxidase (apocynin and DPI), mitochondrial respiration
(rotenone) and NOS (L-NAME). LPS + IFNgamma caused a marked increase in ROS
production; this increase was abolished by inhibition of NADPH oxidase (apocynin,
DPI and p47phox deficiency). LPS + IFNgamma induced substantial expression of
iNOS protein. iNOS expression was prevented by the antioxidant ascorbate and by
NADPH oxidase inhibition (apocynin, DPI and p47phox deficiency), but not by
inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (rotenone) and xanthine oxidase
(allopurinol). iNOS expression also was prevented by selective antagonists of
ERK, JNK, Jak2, and NFkappaB activation. LPS + IFNgamma stimulated
activation/phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and Jak2 and activation/degradation of
IkappaB, but only the activation of JNK and Jak2 was sensitive to ascorbate,
apocynin and p47phox deficiency. Ascorbate, apocynin and p47phox deficiency also 
inhibited the LPS + IFNgamma-induced DNA binding activity of transcription
factors IRF1 and AP1 but not NFkappaB. In conclusion, LPS + IFNgamma-induced
NFkappaB activation is necessary for iNOS induction but is not dependent on ROS
signaling. LPS + IFNgamma-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity produces ROS that
activate the JNK-AP1 and Jak2-IRF1 signaling pathways required for iNOS
induction. Since blocking either NFkappaB activation or NADPH oxidase activity is
sufficient to prevent iNOS expression, they are separate targets for therapeutic 
interventions that aim to modulate iNOS expression in sepsis.

The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors regulates
the expression of a variety of genes involved in apoptosis and immune response.
We examined relationships between genotypes at five NF-kappaB subunits (NFKB1,
NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB) and variable expression levels of 15 NF-kappaB
regulated proteins with heritability greater than 0.40: BCL2A1, BIRC2, CD40,
CD44, CD80, CFLAR, CR2, FAS, ICAM1, IL15, IRF1, JUNB, MYC, SLC2A5, and VCAM1. SNP
genotypes and expression phenotypes from pedigrees of Utah residents with
ancestry from northern and western Europe were provided by Genetic Analysis
Workshop 15 and supplemented with additional genotype data from the International
HapMap Consortium. We conducted association, linkage, and family-based
association analyses between each candidate gene and the 15 heritable expression 
phenotypes. We observed consistent results in association and linkage analyses of
the NFKB1 region (encoding p50) and levels of FAS and IRF1 expression. FAS is a
cell surface protein that also belongs to the TNF-receptor family; signals
through FAS are able to induce apoptosis. IRF1 is a member of the interferon
regulatory transcription factor family, which has been shown to regulate
apoptosis and tumor-suppression. Analyses in the REL region (encoding c-Rel)
revealed linkage and association with CD40 phenotype. CD40 proteins belong to the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor family, which mediates a broad variety of
immune and inflammatory responses. We conclude that variation in the genes
encoding p50 and c-Rel may play a role in NF-kappaB-related transcription of FAS,
IRF1, and CD40.

Identifying genetic factors associated with the development of adverse events
might allow screening before vaccinia virus administration. Two independent
clinical trials of the smallpox vaccine (Aventis Pasteur) were conducted in
healthy, vaccinia virus-naive adult volunteers. Volunteers were assessed
repeatedly for local and systemic adverse events (AEs) associated with the
receipt of vaccine and underwent genotyping for 1,442 singlenucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). In the first study, 36 SNPs in 26 genes were associated
with systemic AEs (P <or= .05); these 26 genes were tested in the second study.
In the final analysis, 3 SNPs were consistently associated with AEs in both
studies. The presence of a nonsynonymous SNP in the methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR)gene was associated with the risk ofAEin both trials (odds ratio
[OR], 2.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.1-5.2] [P = .04] and OR, 4.1 [95% CI, 
1.4 -11.4] [P<.01]). Two SNPs in the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) gene
were associated with the risk of AE in both sample sets (OR, 3.2 [95% CI,
1.1-9.8] [P = .03] andOR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.1- 8.3] [P = .03]). Genetic
polymorphisms in genes expressing an enzyme previously associated with adverse
reactions to a variety of pharmacologic agents (MTHFR) and an immunological
transcription factor (IRF1) were associated with AEs after smallpox vaccination
in 2 independent study samples.

Immediate lymphotoxin beta receptor-mediated transcriptional response in host
defense against L. monocytogenes.

Heinrich-Heine-University of Düsseldorf, Universitätsstr. 1, D-40225 Düsseldorf, 
Germany.

The lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) mediates crucial signals in host defense 
against intracellular bacteria and viruses. Mice deficient in LTbetaR readily
succumb to infections with Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). LTbetaR has been shown to be important for the
early induction of interferon (IFN) beta after infection with mCMV. However, up
to now, it is not known which host effector molecules are induced in cells of the
innate immune system after bacterial infections. In order to address this
question, comprehensive transcriptome profiling of LTbetaR-deficient and control 
splenocytes depleted from T and B lymphocytes was performed and differentially
regulated genes were identified. Interestingly, a deficiency in IFNalpha- and
IFNgamma-mRNA transcription could be found in LTbetaR-deficient cells leading to 
a marked failure in the immediate up-regulation of IFN controlled genes. These
encompass interferon regulatory factors (IRF1 and IRF7), signal transducer
activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (STAT1 and STAT2), chemokines, IFN
regulated GTPases (IRGs, GBPs), and IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide
repeats (IFITs). Thus, the immediate LTbetaR-initiated transcriptional response
of innate immune cells carries an IFN signature and is responsible for mounting
an effective innate immune response to L. monocytogenes.

Tie2-R849W mutant in venous malformations chronically activates a functional
STAT1 to modulate gene expression.

University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC.

Tie2 is an endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase. An amino-acid substitution of
tryptophan for arginine at residue 849 (Tie2-R849W) leads to a ligand-independent
activation of its kinase activity. This mutation has been associated with
familial venous malformations (VMs), manifested by variable thickness or lack of 
smooth-muscle cells in the veins of patient lesions. The underlying mechanism for
Tie2-R849W action in endothelial cells remains elusive. In this study, we used
adenoviral infection to differentiate the effects of ectopic Tie2 (wild type,
kinase-dead K855A, or constitutively active R849W) expression on endothelial
cellular behaviors and Tie2-mediated downstream targets. Ectopic Tie2 reduced
endothelial cell proliferation and serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, while
stimulating migration. When comparing R849W with K855A and its wild-type
counterpart, a functional tyrosine kinase activity was required only for
migration, and constitutively active Tie2-R849W conferred highest resistance to
serum-induced apoptosis, but lowest ability to maintain tube-like structures
formed on Matrigel. We further demonstrated that Tie2-R849W chronically induced
STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the promoter activity of STAT1-responsive
IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Although STAT1 phosphorylation required JNK and
p38MAPK activation, only JNK activation was essential for IRF1 promoter
activation by Tie2-R849W. Additional studies are needed to study the role of
STAT1 activation in VMs.

TNF activates an IRF1-dependent autocrine loop leading to sustained expression of

Rapid induction of inflammatory genes by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been
well studied, but little is known about delayed and chronic TNF responses. Here
we investigated the kinetics of primary macrophage responses to TNF and
discovered that TNF initiates an interferon-beta-mediated autocrine loop that
sustains expression of inflammatory genes and induces delayed expression of
interferon-response genes such as those encoding the transcription factors STAT1 
and IRF7, which enhance macrophage responses to stimulation of cytokines and
Toll-like receptors. TNF-induced interferon-beta production depended on
interferon-response factor 1, and downstream gene expression was mediated by
synergy between small amounts of interferon-beta and canonical TNF-induced
signals. Thus, TNF activates a 'feed-forward' loop that sustains inflammation but
avoids the potential toxicity associated with the high interferon production
induced by stimulation of Toll-like receptors.

The coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) was originally described as a

required for normal heart development. However, the role of CAR in virus-induced 
myocarditis has not been investigated so far. The purpose of this study was to
assess myocardial CAR expression in response to cytokine-induced inflammatory
reactions during the course of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. In Balb/c mice
intraperitoneally infected with either 2x10(4) plaque-forming units (PFUs) of
coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) or 10(2) PFUs CVB3, CAR expression and tyrosine
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a 
known cytokine-inducible transcription factor involved in viral defense, were
determined. Our results demonstrated that within the first 7 days after virus
inoculation, when the viral replication and STAT1 activation in the heart tissue 
was most prominent, the expression of CAR did not surpass that of uninfected
controls. However, the up-regulation of CAR was observed 9 weeks later, when
enteroviral RNA was no longer detectable and activation of STAT1 had already
ceased. In contrast to the STAT1 target genes Mig and Irf1, interferon gamma
stimulation failed to up-regulate Car expression in isolated cardiomyocytes. In
human endomyocardial biopsies, Car expression was found to be elevated in
approximately one third of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (9 of 30
patients) as compared with controls. Thus, activation of STAT1 clearly precedes
the enhanced CAR expression observed during tissue reorganization, suggesting an 
essential role of STAT1 transcription factors in orchestrating the sequential
actions involved in adaptive immune response.

The salt dependence of the interferon regulatory factor 1 DNA binding domain
binding to DNA reveals ions are localized around protein and DNA.

The equilibrium dissociation constant of the DNA binding domain of interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1 DBD) for its DNA binding site depends strongly on salt 
concentration and salt type. These dependencies are consistent with IRF1 DBD
binding to DNA, resulting in the release of cations from the DNA and both release
of anions from the protein and uptake of a cation by the protein. We demonstrated
this by utilizing the fact that the release of fluoride from protein upon complex
formation does not contribute to the salt concentration dependence of binding and
by studying mutants in which charged residues in IRF1 DBD that form salt bridges 
with DNA phosphates are changed to alanine. The salt concentration dependencies
of the dissociation constants of wild-type IRF1 DBD and the mutants R64A, D73A,
K75A, and D73A/K75A were measured in buffer containing NaF, NaCl, or NaBr. The
salt concentration and type dependencies of the mutants relative to wild-type
IRF1 DBD provide evidence of charge neutralization by solution ions for R64 and
by a salt bridge between D73 and K75 in buffer containing chloride or bromide
salts. These data also allowed us to determine the number, type, and localization
of condensed ions around both IRF1 DBD and its DNA binding site.

Leishmania major infection activates NF-kappaB and interferon regulatory factors 
1 and 8 in human dendritic cells.

The salient feature of dendritic cells (DC) is the initiation of appropriate
adaptive immune responses by discriminating between pathogens. Using a prototypic
model of intracellular infection, we previously showed that Leishmania major
parasites prime human DC for efficient interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion. L. major
infection is associated with self-limiting cutaneous disease and powerful
immunity. In stark contrast, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis,
Leishmania donovani, does not prime human DC for IL-12 production. Here, we
report that DC priming by L. major infection results in the early activation of
NF-kappaB transcription factors and the up-regulation and nuclear translocation
of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-8. The inhibition of NF-kappaB 
activation by the pretreatment of DC with caffeic acid phenethyl ester blocks L. 
major-induced IRF-1 and IRF-8 activation and IL-12 expression. We further
demonstrate that IRF-1 and IRF-8 obtained from L. major-infected human DC
specifically bind to their consensus binding sites on the IL-12p35 promoter,
indicating that L. major infection either directly stimulates a signaling cascade
or induces an autocrine pathway that activates IRF-1 and IRF-8, ultimately
resulting in IL-12 transcription.

Endothelial cells derived from the corpus luteum (CLENDOs) exhibit diverse
characteristics presumably serving their wide-ranging roles in luteal function
and fate. Here, several attributes of CLENDOs derived from cows at midcycle (days
9-12 of the estrous cycle) were compared with CLENDOs from early pregnancy (day
60 of pregnancy). Flow cytometric analysis of cells fluorescently-tagged with the
lectins Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS-1) and Concanavalin A (ConA) indicated that 
CLENDOs of midcycle CL do not differ from those of pregnancy. Mean fluorescence
intensity for BS-1 was 15 +/- 1 and 23 +/- 7 fluorescent units for midcycle
CLENDOs and CLENDOs of pregnancy, respectively (P>0.05). For ConA, mean
fluorescence was 25 +/- 2 and 26 +/- 1 fluorescent units, respectively (P>0.05). 
The CLENDOs were also exposed to cytokines to assess differences in activation of
nuclear factor kappa B signaling (NF-kappaB), induction of the transcription
factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), cytokine production, and
cytokine-induced cell death. In response to TNF, for instance, both types of
CLENDOs exhibited a rapid, 5-fold decrease in NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA) 
protein expression (P<0.05), and a 4-fold increase in IRF1 expression (P<0.05),
that did not differ with phenotype (P>0.05). Similarly, both types of CLENDOs
produced tumor necrosis factor alpha and chemokine ligand 2 in response to IFNG
stimulation (P<0.05) that did not differ with phenotype (P>0.05). Lastly,
extended exposure of CLENDOs of midcycle CL to cytokines induced cell death (~50%
cell death vs. control) similar to the incidence of cell death seen previously in
CLENDOs of early pregnancy. The results indicate that several physical and
functional characteristics of CLENDOs of midcycle CL are retained through early
pregnancy, including lectin-binding properties, sensitivity to cytokines, and the
activation of cytokine-initiated intracellular signals.

Activation of innate immunity (NK/IFN-gamma) in rat allogeneic liver
transplantation: contribution to liver injury and suppression of hepatocyte
proliferation.

Liver transplantation is presently the only curative treatment for patients with 
end-stage liver disease. However, the mechanisms underlying liver injury and
hepatocyte proliferation posttransplantation remain obscure. In this
investigation, liver injury and hepatocyte proliferation in syngeneic and
allogeneic animal models were compared. Male Lewis and Dark Agouti (DA) rats were
subjected to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Rat OLT was performed in
syngeneic (Lewis-Lewis) and allogeneic (Lewis-DA or DA-Lewis) animal models.
Allogeneic liver grafts exhibited greater injury and cellular apoptosis than
syngeneic grafts but less hepatocyte proliferation after OLT. Expression of
IFN-gamma mRNA and activation of the downstream signal transducer and activator
of transcription 1 (STAT1) and genes (interferon regulatory factor-1 and
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CDKN1A)) were also greater in the
allogeneic grafts compared with the syngeneic grafts. In contrast, STAT3
activation was lower in the allogeneic grafts. Furthermore, in the allogeneic
grafts, depletion of natural killer (NK) cells decreased IFN-gamma/STAT1
activation but enhanced hepatocyte proliferation. These findings suggest that,
compared with syngeneic transplantation, innate immunity (NK/IFN-gamma) is
activated after allogeneic transplantation, which likely contributes to liver
injury and inhibits hepatocyte proliferation.

The interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play key roles in host defense against 
viral infections and immune surveillance against cancer. We report that BCR-ABL
transformation of hematopoietic cells results in suppression of IFN-dependent
responses, including transcription of IFN-inducible genes and generation of
IFN-mediated antiviral effects. BCR-ABL transformation suppresses expression of
several IFN-regulated genes containing IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) or
GAS elements in their promoters, including Isg15, Irf1, Irf9, and Ifit2
(interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2). Suppression of
transcription of ISRE-containing genes is also seen in cells expressing various
BCR-ABL kinase domain mutants, including T315I, H396P, Y253F, and E255K, but not 
kinase-defective BCR-ABL. Such effects are associated with impaired IFN-dependent
phosphorylation of Stat1 on Tyr(701) and Stat3 on Tyr(705) and defective binding 
of Stat complexes to ISRE or GAS elements. Beyond suppression of Stat activities,
BCR-ABL inhibits IFN-inducible phosphorylation/activation of the p38 MAPK,
suggesting a dual mechanism by which this abnormal fusion protein blocks IFN
transcriptional responses. The inhibitory activities of BCR-ABL ultimately result
in impaired IFNalpha-mediated protection against encephalomyocarditis virus
infection and reversal of IFN-dependent growth suppression. Altogether, our data 
provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which BCR-ABL impairs host defenses and
promotes malignant transformation, involving dual suppression of IFN-activated
signaling pathways.

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural (NS) 3/4A protein complex inhibits the
retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway by proteolytically cleaving
mitochondria-associated CARD-containing adaptor protein Cardif, and this leads to
reduced production of beta interferon (IFN-beta). This study examined the
expression of CCL5 (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and
secreted, or RANTES), CXCL8 (interleukin 8) and CXCL10 (IFN-gamma-activated
protein 10, or IP-10) chemokine genes in osteosarcoma cell lines that inducibly
expressed NS3/4A, NS4B, core-E1-E2-p7 and the entire HCV polyprotein. Sendai
virus (SeV)-induced production of IFN-beta, CCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL10 was
downregulated by the NS3/4A protein complex and by the full-length HCV
polyprotein. Expression of NS3/4A and the HCV polyprotein reduced the binding of 
interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) 1 and 3 and, to a lesser extent, nuclear
factor (NF)-kappaB (p65/p50) to their respective binding elements on the CXCL10
promoter during SeV infection. Furthermore, binding of IRF1 and IRF3 to the
interferon-stimulated response element-like element, and of c-Jun and
phosphorylated c-Jun to the activator protein 1 element of the CXCL8 promoter,
was reduced when NS3/4A and the HCV polyprotein were expressed. In cell lines
expressing NS3/4A and the HCV polyprotein, the subcellular localization of
mitochondria was changed, and this was kinetically associated with the partial
degradation of endogenous Cardif. These results indicate that NS3/4A alone or as 
part of the HCV polyprotein disturbs the expression of IRF1- and IRF3-regulated
genes, as well as affecting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase- and
NF-kappaB-regulated genes.

Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a novel IL-12 family member that plays a critical role 
in the regulation of T-cell responses. Its immunoregulatory effects on
endothelial cells (EC) remain unexplored. Here we show a role for IL-27 in the
induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in primary human
EC. Stimulation of human umbilical vein ECs by IL-27 rapidly induces IFN
regulatory factor-1 and dramatically increases the expression of major
histocompatibility class II transactivator (CIITA) isoform IV. Expression of this
transactivator correlates with increased MHC class II gene expression. IL-27 also
enhances expression of MHC class I molecules. Furthermore expression of
beta2-microglobulin and transporter associated with antigen processing-1
transcripts increases in response to IL-27. Additional microarray analysis
demonstrates that IL-27 significantly upregulates a panel of genes that
correlates with immune regulation, including the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and
CX3CL1 in human umbilical vein ECs. This first demonstration that both MHC II and
I expression are increased in EC after IL-27 stimulation suggests that IL-27 may 
be important in conferring immune function on vascular endothelium.

interactions.

BACKGROUND: Reliable transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction methods 
are essential for computer annotation of large amount of genome sequence data.
However, current methods to predict TFBSs are hampered by the high false-positive
rates that occur when only sequence conservation at the core binding-sites is
considered.
RESULTS: To improve this situation, we have quantified the performance of several
Position Weight Matrix (PWM) algorithms, using exhaustive approaches to find
their optimal length and position. We applied these approaches to bio-medically
important TFBSs involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation as
well as in inflammatory, immune, and antiviral responses (NF-kappaB, ISGF3, IRF1,
STAT1), obesity and lipid metabolism (PPAR, SREBP, HNF4), regulation of the
steroidogenic (SF-1) and cell cycle (E2F) genes expression. We have also gained
extra specificity using a method, entitled SiteGA, which takes into account
structural interactions within TFBS core and flanking regions, using a genetic
algorithm (GA) with a discriminant function of locally positioned dinucleotide
(LPD) frequencies. To ensure a higher confidence in our approach, we applied
resampling-jackknife and bootstrap tests for the comparison, it appears that,
optimized PWM and SiteGA have shown similar recognition performances. Then we
applied SiteGA and optimized PWMs (both separately and together) to sequences in 
the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD). The resulting SiteGA recognition models
can now be used to search sequences for BSs using the web tool, SiteGA. Analysis 
of dependencies between close and distant LPDs revealed by SiteGA models has
shown that the most significant correlations are between close LPDs, and are
generally located in the core (footprint) region. A greater number of less
significant correlations are mainly between distant LPDs, which spanned both core
and flanking regions. When SiteGA and optimized PWM models were applied together,
this substantially reduced false positives at least at higher stringencies.
CONCLUSION: Based on this analysis, SiteGA adds substantial specificity even to
optimized PWMs and may be considered for large-scale genome analysis. It adds to 
the range of techniques available for TFBS prediction, and EPD analysis has led
to a list of genes which appear to be regulated by the above TFs.

A multitiered genetic association study of 25 215 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in three case-control sample sets (1446 patients and 1432 controls)
identified three IL13-linked SNPs (rs1800925, rs20541 and rs848) associated with 
psoriasis. Although the susceptibility effects at these SNPs were modest (joint
allelic odds ratios (ORs): 0.76 to 0.78; P(comb): 1.3E-03 to 2.50E-04), the
association patterns were consistent across the sample sets, with the minor
alleles being protective. Haplotype analyses identified one common, susceptible
haplotype CCG (joint allelic OR=1.27; P(comb)=1.88E-04) and a less common,
protective haplotype TTT (joint allelic OR=0.74; P(comb)=7.05E-04). In
combination with the other known genetic risk factors, HLA-C, IL12B and IL23R,
the variants reported here generate an 11-fold psoriasis-risk differential.
Residing in the 5q31 cytokine gene cluster, IL13 encodes an important
T-cell-derived cytokine that regulates cell-mediated immunity. These results
provide the foundation for additional studies required to fully dissect the
associations within this cytokine-rich genomic region, as polymorphisms in
closely linked candidate genes, such as IRF1, IL5 or IL4, may be driving these
results through linkage disequilibrium.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) drive T helper type 1
(T(H)1) differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the
complicated gene networks involved in this differentiation are not fully
understood. Here we show that the IFN-gamma-induced transcription factor IRF1 was
essential in T(H)1 differentiation by acting on Il12rb1, the gene encoding the
IL-12 receptor beta1 subunit (IL-12Rbeta1). IRF1 directly interacted with and
activated the Il12rb1 promoter in CD4+ T cells. Notably, the IRF1-dependent
induction of IL-12Rbeta1 was essential for IFN-gamma-IL-12 signaling but was
dispensable for IL-23-IL-17 signaling. Because both IL-12 and IL-23 bind to and
transmit signals through IL-12Rbeta1, our data suggest that distinct thresholds
of IL-12Rbeta1 expression are required for T(H)1 versus T(H)-17 differentiation.

Cross-inhibition of interferon-induced signals by GM-CSF through a block in Stat1
activation.

We investigated the effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) on biologic signals induced by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and
IFN-gamma. In hematopoietic cell lines, IFN-induced signaling was investigated by
Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), flow cytometry,
protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) assays, and RT-PCR. GM-CSF inhibited
IFN-alpha-induced and IFN-gamma-induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation in a
time-dependent manner. EMSA showed that GM-CSF inhibited IFN-alpha-induced and
IFN-gamma-induced IFN-gamma activator sequence (GAS) binding activity. As a
consequence, IFN-induced transcription of the early response gene, IFN-stimulated
gene 54 (ISG54), was inhibited. The expression of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
and MHC class I antigens was downregulated at protein levels in hematopoietic
cell lines (U937, THP1). In contrast to GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) did not influence the IFN-induced Stat1
activation. To explore the molecular mechanism of suppression of Stat1 tyrosine
phosphorylation, we investigated the induction and activation of
cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein/suppressor of cytokine signaling
(CIS/SOCS) molecules and phosphatases on GM-CSF treatment. In contrast to G-CSF
and IL-3, GM-CSF strongly induced the expression of CIS1 and SOCS2 at mRNA
levels, but overexpression of CIS1 or SOCS2 in HEK293 cells did not show
inhibition of Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation upon IFN treatment. In PTP assays,
on GM-CSF incubation, no enhanced src homology 2 domain tyrosine phosphatase 1
and 2 (SHP1 and SHP2) activity was detectable. However, GM-CSF-induced
downregulation of Tyk2 and Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as Tyk2 protein 
levels likely contributed to the reduced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In
hematopoietic cells, GM-CSF antagonizes IFN-induced signals by a block in Stat1
activation.

XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a novel tumor suppressor and interferon
stimulated gene (ISG). Interferon beta (IFNbeta) exerts anti-proliferative effect
and induces apoptosis through the Jak-Stat signaling cascade by the type I
Interferon receptor (IFN-R), which initiates gene transcription of those
biological effectors of IFNbeta. The aim of this study is to determine the effect
of IFNbeta on XAF1 expression and the putative mechanisms mediated by the
critical role of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (Stat1).
Gene expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The promoter
activity of XAF1 was examined by luciferase reporter assay. The activity of
interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) was assessed by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay 
(Q-ChIP). Results showed that IFNbeta stimulated XAF1 promoter activity in colon 
cancer cell line DLD1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A high affinity ISRE 
binding element (ISRE-XAF1) was located in -55 to -66 nt upstream of the first
ATG site of XAF1 gene. Deletion of ISRE-XAF1 completely abrogated basal and
IFNbeta-induced promoter activity. IFNbeta-induced XAF1 expression was mediated
by Stat1 through the interaction with ISRE-XAF1. Knocking down of the Stat1
expression and blocking its phosphorylation decreased IFNbeta-induced XAF1
expression. Results suggested that induction of an immediate early response
gene-XAF1 by IFNbeta was mediated by the transcription regulator Stat1 through
the ISRE site within the promoter region of XAF1 gene in colon cancer.

PRDM1/BLIMP-1 modulates IFN-gamma-dependent control of the MHC class I
antigen-processing and peptide-loading pathway.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine,

A diverse spectrum of unique peptide-MHC class I complexes guides CD8 T cell
responses toward viral or stress-induced Ags. Multiple components are required to
process Ag and facilitate peptide loading in the endoplasmic reticulum.
IFN-gamma, a potent proinflammatory cytokine, markedly up-regulates transcription
of genes involved in MHC class I assembly. Physiological mechanisms which
counteract this response are poorly defined. We demonstrate that promoters of
functionally linked genes on this pathway contain conserved regulatory elements
that allow antagonistic regulation by IFN-gamma and the transcription factor B
lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (also known as PR domain-containing 1,
with ZNF domain (PRDM1)). Repression of ERAP1, TAPASIN, MECL1, and LMP7 by PRDM1 
results in failure to up-regulate surface MHC class I in response to IFN-gamma in
human cell lines. Using the sea urchin prdm1 ortholog, we demonstrate that the
capacity of PRDM1 to repress the IFN response of such promoters is evolutionarily
ancient and that dependence on the precise IFN regulatory factor element sequence
is highly conserved. This indicates that the functional interaction between PRDM1
and IFN-regulated pathways antedates the evolution of the adaptive immune system 
and the MHC, and identifies a unique role for PRDM1 as a key regulator of Ag
presentation by MHC class I.

(Hoffmann-La Roche) (group A, n = 31), and with DTIC, IFNalpha and 13-cis-RA
(Isotretinoin, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (group B, n = 29). Patients
and 42 healthy controls were evaluated by FACS flow analyses for CD3/CD56/CD69
positive cells, NK cytotoxicity in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and
for interferon regulatory factor-1 mRNA expression by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction in treated PBL.
RESULTS: The addition of RA to a DTIC-IFN regime did not bring any therapeutical 
benefit in terms of response or survival. Immunological follow-up on days 1, 6
and 27 of each therapy cycle shows a significant increase in NK cell activity in 
both groups, only on day 6 of the first cycle, while CD69+CD56+ expression
increased significantly on day 6 of each therapy cycle, in both groups.
Evaluation of the dynamics of expression of IRF-1 of in vitro treated PBL, shows 
its strong and prompt up-regulation by IFNalpha and synergistic effect of
IFNalpha and RA combination.
CONCLUSION: The dynamics of the increase in CD69 early activation antigen
expression on CD56+ NK cells is systematic and serial with the increase being
significantly higher on day six of the first cycle in group B patients with
clinical response, compared to those without, indicating possible predictive
value of CD69 expression for clinical response to chemoimmunotherapy.

role of interferon regulatory factor-1.

We have previously shown that long-term treatment of airway smooth muscle (ASM)
cells with a combination of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma impaired steroid
anti-inflammatory action through the up-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor
beta isoform (GRbeta) (Mol Pharmacol 2006;69:588-596). We here found that steroid
actions could also be suppressed by short-term exposure of ASM cells to TNF-alpha
and IFN-gamma (6 h) as shown by the abrogated glucocorticoid responsive element
(GRE)-dependent gene transcription; surprisingly, neither GRalpha nuclear
translocation nor GRbeta expression was affected by cytokine mixture. The earlier
induction of CD38, a molecule recently involved in asthma, seen with TNF-alpha
and IFN-gamma combination but not with cytokine alone, was also completely
insensitive to steroid pretreatment. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (IP) and siRNA
strategies revealed not only increased binding of interferon regulatory factor 1 
(IRF-1) transcription factor to CD38 promoter, but also its implication in
regulating CD38 gene transcription. Interestingly, the capacity of fluticasone to
completely inhibit TNF-alpha-induced IRF-1 expression, IRF-1 DNA binding, and
transactivation activities was completely lost in cells exposed to TNF-alpha and 
IFN-gamma in combination. This early steroid dysfunction seen with cytokine
combination could be reproduced by enhancing IRF-1 cellular levels using
constitutively active IRF-1, which dose-dependently inhibited GRE-dependent gene 
transcription. Consistently, reducing IRF-1 cellular levels using siRNA approach 
significantly restored steroid transactivation activities. Collectively, our
findings demonstrate for the first time that IRF-1 is a novel alternative
GRbeta-independent mechanism mediating steroid dysfunction induced by
pro-asthmatic cytokines, in part via the suppression of GRalpha activities.

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced expression of ABCA1 in blood monocytes
precedes coronary atherosclerosis and is associated with plaque complexity in
hypercholesterolemic pigs.

Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Herestraat 49, Leuven, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Elevated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is associated with 
atherosclerosis and high cardiovascular risk. Previously, we identified 18 genes 
in coronary plaque macrophages of hypercholesterolemic pigs that correlated with 
plaque oxLDL.
OBJECTIVE: To determine which of these genes were differentially expressed in
blood monocytes and correlated with blood and plaque oxLDL and with plaque
complexity.
METHODS: RNA expression in monocytes of 27 hypercholesterolemic and 12 control
pigs was analyzed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Five of 12 genes with detectable expression in monocytes were
overexpressed (at P < 0.01 level) in blood monocytes of hypercholesterolemic
pigs: ABCA1, SCD, IRF1, SDC2, and TLR2. ABCA1 RNA expression in blood monocytes
correlated with blood oxLDL, and its RNA and protein expression was increased
prior to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Higher expression of ABCA1 in
monocytes was associated with higher plaque complexity and higher plaque oxLDL.
Immunostaining of coronary plaques showed the association of ABCA1 with
macrophages, lipids, and oxLDL; ABCA1 protein correlated with plaque oxLDL (R(2) 
= 0.66; P < 0.0001). In THP-1 monocytes, oxLDL induced ABCA1 expression.
OxLDL-induced foam cell generation in THP-1 and human monocyte-derived
macrophages was associated with a further increase of ABCA1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of ABCA1 in monocytes in association with blood oxLDL
prior to atherosclerotic lesion formation and the association of higher ABCA1
with higher plaque complexity suggests that ABCA1 is an early biomarker of
atherosclerosis. Studies in humans are warranted.

Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays a critical role in murine uterine spiral artery
remodeling for successful pregnancy. The effect of IFN-gamma on human uterine
microvasculature, however, remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was
to identify the genes regulated by IFN-gamma in human uterine microvascular
endothelial cells. The effect of IFN-gamma on the gene expression profile in
human uterine microvascular endothelial cells was evaluated by cDNA microarray
analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction for the selected genes of interest. In vivo expression of the protein
encoded by some of these genes in human uterine microvascular endothelial cells
was evaluated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Treatment with 10
ng/ml IFN-gamma for 4 h induced a significant > or =2-fold change in 29 genes in 
pooled human uterine microvascular endothelial cells; a total of 20 genes were
up-regulated, whereas nine genes were down-regulated. The genes significantly
up-regulated included chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL8, IL15RA, and CCL5), enzymes
(GBP5, TAP1, CYP27B1, SOD2, MX1, CASP1, and PTGES), and transcription factors
(TFAP2C, IRF1, NFE2L3). The genes significantly down-regulated following
IFN-gamma treatment included cytokines/cytokine receptors (CSF2, IL1R2, and
SPP1), and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (WISP2 and IGFBP3). The
results of the cDNA microarray analysis were confirmed by quantitative real-time 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the selected 17 genes of
interest. The immunoreactivity for the proteins encoded by IL15RA, IFI30, and MX1
was detected in human uterine microvascular endothelial cells in vivo, whereas
the immunoreactivity for CCNA1 and NQO1 was not detectable. These results suggest
that IFN-gamma regulates the gene expression involved in natural killer cell
recruitment, embryo and trophoblast migration, endometrial decidualization,
angiogenesis, angiostasis, and anti-viral infection in human uterine
microvascular endothelial cells.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a key messenger involved in physiological functions
including endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, inhibition of platelet
adhesion and aggregation and regulation of inflammatory and immune responses.
Here we briefly introduce NO and its functions and then describe our work over
the past several years examining the role of NO in EAE in both the rat and the
mouse. We show that NO plays a significant role in determining the resistance or 
susceptibility to EAE in various strains and or sexes of animals. We demonstrate 
that NO down-regulates several aspects of CNS inflammation but also has a dual
role in that it is required for inflammation in some situations.

disease.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates
the functions of type I and II interferons and plays a role in host protection.
Behçet's disease (BD) is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis that is often
complicated with thrombotic features, and infectious agents have long been
postulated to be a disease-triggering factor in its pathogenesis. The authors
investigated the distributions of IRF-1 promoter -415 C/A, -410 A/G, and -300
A/G, and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) A/G polymorphisms in 105 BD patients (mean 
age 41.7 +/- SEM 1.1 years, 44 male and 61 female) and in 105 gender- and
age-matched healthy controls. The frequencies of individual alleles and genotypes
were not different between the control and BD groups. However, the frequency of
AGGG haplotype was significantly higher (73.5% vs 60.2%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.842,
95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.219-2.783, p(c) = 0.036) and that of the
CAAG haplotype was significantly lower (2.2% vs 9.5%, OR = 0.195, 95% CI =
0.068-0.559, p(c) = 0.02) in BD patients than in healthy controls. In addition,
the frequency of the AGGG haplotype was significantly higher (80.3% vs 57.4%, OR 
= 3.033, 95% CI = 1.716-5.360, p(c) = 0.001) and that of the CAAG haplotype was
significantly lower (0.8% vs 12.3%; OR = 0.059, 95% CI = 0.010-0.357, p(c) =
0.005) in female BD patients than female controls. By subgroup analyses, the CAAA
haplotype tended to be more common in BD patients with moderate or severe disease
than in those with mild disease (25.4% vs 13.6%, OR = 2.158, 95% CI =
1.046-4.440, p = 0.037 before Bonferroni correction). When BD patients were
subclassified by a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the CAAA haplotype was 
found to be significantly increased the risk of DVT (42.1% vs 15.7%, OR = 3.906, 
95% CI = 1.836-8.324, p(c) = 0.0015) and the AGGG haplotype tended to reduce this
risk (57.9% vs 77.3%, OR = 0.403, 95% CI = 0.195-0.834, p(c) = 0.0685).
Furthermore, the frequency of the CAAA haplotype was significantly higher in BD
patients that had experienced a thrombotic event than in those that had not
(40.5% vs 15.5%, OR = 3.7147, 95% CI = 1.778-7.770, p(c) = 0.0015). These results
suggest that IRF-1 is a novel susceptibility gene in BD, especially in women, and
furthermore, that IRF-1 polymorphisms may be related to thrombosis in BD
patients.

Social regulation of gene expression in human leukocytes.

(1)Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, UCLA School of
Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1678, USA. coles@ucla.edu

BACKGROUND: Social environmental influences on human health are well established 
in the epidemiology literature, but their functional genomic mechanisms are
unclear. The present study analyzed genome-wide transcriptional activity in
people who chronically experienced high versus low levels of subjective social
isolation (loneliness) to assess alterations in the activity of transcription
control pathways that might contribute to increased adverse health outcomes in
social isolates.
RESULTS: DNA microarray analysis identified 209 genes that were differentially
expressed in circulating leukocytes from 14 high- versus low-lonely individuals, 
including up-regulation of genes involved in immune activation, transcription
control, and cell proliferation, and down-regulation of genes supporting mature B
lymphocyte function and type I interferon response. Promoter-based bioinformatic 
analyses showed under-expression of genes bearing anti-inflammatory
glucocorticoid response elements (GREs; p = 0.032) and over-expression of genes
bearing response elements for pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB/Rel transcription
factors (p = 0.011). This reciprocal shift in pro- and anti-inflammatory
signaling was not attributable to differences in circulating cortisol levels, or 
to other demographic, psychological, or medical characteristics. Additional
transcription control pathways showing differential activity in bioinformatic
analyses included the CREB/ATF, JAK/STAT, IRF1, C/EBP, Oct, and GATA pathways.
CONCLUSION: These data provide the first indication that human genome-wide
transcriptional activity is altered in association with a social epidemiological 
risk factor. Impaired transcription of glucocorticoid response genes and
increased activity of pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways provide a
functional genomic explanation for elevated risk of inflammatory disease in
individuals who experience chronically high levels of subjective social
isolation.

Virus replication induces the expression of antiviral type I (IFN-alphabeta) and 
type III (IFN-lambda1-3 or IL-28A/B and IL-29) IFN genes via TLR-dependent and
-independent pathways. Although type III IFNs differ genetically from type I
IFNs, their similar biological antiviral functions suggest that their expression 
is regulated in a similar fashion. Structural and functional characterization of 
the IFN-lambda1 and IFN-lambda3 gene promoters revealed them to be similar to
IFN-beta and IFN-alpha genes, respectively. Both of these promoters had
functional IFN-stimulated response element and NF-kappaB binding sites. The
binding of IFN regulatory factors (IRF) to type III IFN promoter IFN-stimulated
response element sites was the most important event regulating the expression of 
these genes. Ectopic expression of the components of TLR7 (MyD88 plus IRF1/IRF7),
TLR3 (Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter-inducing factor), or retinoic
acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signal transduction pathways induced the activation
of IFN-lambda1 promoter, whereas the IFN-lambda3 promoter was efficiently
activated only by overexpression of MyD88 and IRF7. The ectopic expression of
Pin1, a recently identified suppressor for IRF3-dependent antiviral response,
decreased the IFN promoter activation induced by any of these three signal
transduction pathways, including the MyD88-dependent one. To conclude, the data
suggest that the IFN-lambda1 gene is regulated by virus-activated IRF3 and IRF7, 
thus resembling that of the IFN-beta gene, whereas IFN-lambda2/3 gene expression 
is mainly controlled by IRF7, thus resembling those of IFN-alpha genes.

The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus represses gene expression of hRPB10alpha, a
common subunit of host RNA polymerases, through interferon regulatory factor-1
binding site.

Jung CR(1), Choi S, Im DS.

Author information: 
(1)Gene Therapy Research Unit, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and
Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yusong, Daejeon 305-806, Republic of Korea.

The nonstructural (NS) 5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays important
roles in both viral RNA replication and modulation of the physiology of the host 
cell. Here we report that NS5A repressed gene expression of hRPB10alpha, a common
subunit of host RNA polymerases (Pol), in hepatoma cell lines and Huh-7 cells
harboring HCV replicon. Analysis of the hRPB10alpha promoter region revealed that
interferon regulatory factor-1 binding element (IRF-E) was essential for its
transcription. The IRF-E was responsible for the NS5A-mediated repression of the 
hRPB10alpha transcription and its induction by IRF-1 that is known to be induced 
by interferon-alpha. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that IRF-1 bound
to the IRF-E and the binding reduced when NS5A was expressed. NS5A appeared to
negatively regulate IRF-1 expression, which might be partly responsible for the
decrease of hRPB10alpha expression. NS5A expression moderately decreased
promoter-independent Pol activity in vitro. Transcription of adenoviral genes
that are dependent on Pol II or III and propagation of adenoviral genome were
impaired in HeLa cells with stable NS5A expression. The results suggest that NS5A
may partly modulate host cell transcription by the down-regulation of
hRPB10alpha.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania chagasi is endemic to northeast 
Brazil. A positive delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test response (DTH+) is a
marker for acquired resistance to disease, clusters in families and may be
genetically controlled. Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 
genotyped in the cytokine 5q23.3-q31.1 region IRF1-IL5-IL13-IL4-IL9-LECT2-TGFBI
in 102 families (323 DTH+; 190 DTH-; 123 VL individuals) from a VL endemic region
in northeast Brazil. Data from 20 SNPs were analyzed for association with DTH+/- 
status and VL using family-based, stepwise conditional logistic regression
analysis. Independent associations were observed between the DTH+ phenotype and
markers in separate linkage disequilibrium blocks in LECT2 (OR 2.25; P=0.005; 95%
CI=1.28-3.97) and TGFBI (OR 1.94; P=0.003; 95% CI=1.24-3.03). VL child/parent
trios gave no evidence of association, but the DTH- phenotype was associated with
SNP rs2070874 at IL4 (OR 3.14; P=0.006; 95% CI=1.38-7.14), and SNP rs30740
between LECT2 and TGFBI (OR 3.00; P=0.042; 95% CI=1.04-8.65). These results
indicate several genes in the immune response gene cluster at 5q23.3-q31.1
influence outcomes of L. chagasi infection in this region of Brazil.

To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and biologic effects of weekly
liposome-encapsulated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-IV) plus interferon alpha2b
(IFN) in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Twenty-six patients
with metastatic RCC were treated on a phase 1/2 trial with weekly ATRA-IV and IFN
SQ daily 5 d/wk. Twelve patients received ATRA-IV at three dose levels (60, 75,
and 90 mg/m2) according to phase 1 methodology, and 14 additional patients
received 90 mg/m2. Response was assessed according to an intention-to-treat
analysis. Serum retinoic acid (RA) concentrations were assayed and peripheral
blood mononuclear cell mRNA expression of RA and IFN-inducible genes (RARalpha,
RARbeta2, IRF1, CRABP2, and TRAIL) were examined. No dose limiting toxicities
occurred at 60 mg/m2; grade 3 leukopenia affected 1/6 patients at 75 mg/m2,
whereas 3 patients received 90 mg/m2 without a dose limiting toxicities. Fourteen
additional patients received 90 mg/m2 ATRA-IV without grade 3/4 toxicity. Five of
26 (19%) patients achieved a major response, with a median duration of 14 months 
(range 9 to 23); 9 additional patients (41%) demonstrated stable disease or minor
response lasting > or =4 months. No significant differences in serum (RA) after
ATRA infusion were detected between weeks 1 and 8 of treatment. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell mRNA expression did not correlate with clinical response. The
addition of weekly ATRA-IV to IFN therapy is feasible and well tolerated,
resulting in sustainable increased serum (RA). This regimen demonstrates
antitumor activity in metastatic RCC, and suggests ATRA-IV augments IFN therapy.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors decrease Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of
proinflammatory gene expression by impairing transcription factor recruitment.

Post-translational modifications of histone proteins are major mechanisms that
modify chromatin structure and regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. Activation
of histone acetyltransferases or inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is
generally believed to allow chromatin to assume a more open state, permitting
transcriptional activity. We report here the surprising observation that
treatment of murine dendritic cells with the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA)
or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in non-apoptotic concentrations
strongly inhibited induction of both interleukin-12 protein p40 (IL-12p40) mRNA
and protein upon stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Moreover,
TLR-mediated up-regulation of costimulatory molecules was also inhibited.
Up-regulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and protein in response to TLR
agonists was only affected upon prolonged exposure to HDAC inhibitors and
regulation of IL-1 beta was not affected. Similar effects were apparent in murine
and human macrophages. Regarding the mode of action, HDAC inhibition increased
the acetylation status at the IL-12p40 locus. Nevertheless, IL-12p40 chromatin
remodelling, binding of Rel-A and IRF1 to the IL-12p40 promoter and
transcriptional activation were abrogated. In contrast, HDAC inhibitors had no
effects on upstream nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase
activation. Thus HDACs positively regulate the expression of a subset of cytokine
genes by enabling transcription factor recruitment.

The important role of CD8(+) T cells in controlling HIV-1 infection through the
innate as well as the adaptive immune system is well established. In addition to 
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent cytotoxic activity of CD8(+)
T cells, they produce soluble factors that suppress HIV-1 replication in an
MHC-independent manner. Several of those factors have been identified, including 
beta-chemokines, Rantes, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and MDC. We previously identified
that prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) in the conditioned medium of HVS transformed
CD8(+) T cells was a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication following proviral
integration. In this report we further characterize the anti-HIV-1 activity of
ProTalpha by demonstrating its target-cell specificity, distinction from
additional inhibitors of HIV-1 transcription in CD8(+) T cell supernatants, as
well as the differential regulation of host cell antiviral genes that could
impact HIV-1 replication. These genes include a number of transcription factors
as well IFN-alpha-inducible genes including PKR, IRF1, and Rantes, in the absence
of induction of IFN-alpha. These data suggest that the anti-HIV-1 activity of
ProTalpha is mediated through the modulation of a number of genes that have been 
reported to suppress HIV-1 replication including the dysregulation of
transcription factors and the induction of PKR and Rantes mRNA.

1. In a previous study, we demonstrated that heat shock augments vascular
contractility through the stress response. 2. The current study was designed to
identify differentially expressed genes after heat shock by using a novel
annealing control primer (ACP) system, which was developed recently to identify
authentic genes. 3. Rat aortic rings were mounted in organ baths, exposed to 42
degrees C for 45 min and harvested 4 h after the end of heat shock. Total RNA
were used for amplification by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) with ACP system. Differentially amplified PCR products were
sequenced, searched against the GenBank and confirmed by RT-PCR. 4. Genes for
connective tissue growth factor, stress-inducible protein 1 and heat shock
protein 25 were upregulated, whereas a gene for interferon regulatory factor 1
was downregulated. Immunohistochemistry revealed upregulation of the
phosphorylated form of Hsp25 in aortic rings after heat shock. 5. These results
suggest that phosphorylated Hsp25 plays a pivotal role in the augmentation of
vascular contraction after heat shock.

Role of transcription factors in mediating post-ischemic cerebral inflammation
and brain damage.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.

Inflammation is a known precipitator of neuronal death after cerebral ischemia.
The mechanisms that promote or curtail the start and spread of inflammation in
brain are still being debated. By virtue of their capability to modulate gene
expression, several transcription factors induced in the ischemic brain can
modulate the post-ischemic inflammation. While the induction of transcription
factors such as IRF1, NF-kappaB, ATF-2, STAT3, Egr1 and C/EBPbeta is thought to
promote post-ischemic inflammation, activation of transcription factors such as
HIF-1, CREB, c-fos, PPARalpha, PPARgamma and p53 is thought to prevent
post-ischemic inflammation and neuronal damage. Of these, PPARgamma which is a
ligand-activated transcription factor was recently shown to prevent inflammatory 
gene expression in several animal models CNS disorders. This review article
discusses some of the molecular mechanisms of PPARgamma induction by its agonists
following focal cerebral ischemia.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, undergoes spontaneous
regression in certain circumstances, which is potentially immune-mediated. To
understand the immune response surrounding BCCs, we characterized the genomic,
protein, and cellular microenvironment associated with BCC in comparison to
normal skin. Our results demonstrated the following: (1) CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+
surround epithelial tumor aggregates; (2) Immature dendritic cells (DCs) were
abundant in the tumor microenvironment; (3) BCC showed increased expression of
IL-4, IL-10, and CCL22 and increased expression of interferon-associated genes
(IFI27, IRF1, IRF7, and G1P2) and IL-12/23, gene indicating a Th2 dominant
microenvironment. Our findings suggest a dynamic state within the immune
microenvironment associated with BCC. The finding of phenotypic T regs, in
conjunction with immature DCs and Th2 cytokines, suggests an attenuated state of 
immunity to human BCC. In contrast, abundant CD8+ T cells, an interferon signal, 
and IL-12/23 suggest partial host antitumor response. A better understanding of
these opposing forces within the immune microenvironment may facilitate
development of more potent immune-based treatment for BCC and other human
carcinomas.

Loss or mutation of known tumor suppressor genes accounts for a small proportion 
of all breast cancers. We have recently shown that interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) is a putative tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. We now report that
the A4396G single nucleotide polymorphism in the IRF1 gene is more frequent in
human breast cancer cell lines than in the general population (P = 0.01).
Furthermore, A4396G is more frequently expressed in African American (black) than
in European ancestry (white) subjects (n = 70 subjects; P < or = 0.001), leading 
to a significant difference in genotype distribution between these populations (P
= 0.002).

Oxidative stress plays an important role in inflammatory process of celiac
disease. We have studied the effect of the lycopene, quercetin and tyrosol
natural antioxidants on the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated by
gliadin in association with IFN-gamma. The IFN-gamma plus gliadin combination
treatment was capable of enhancing iNOS and COX-2 gene expression and nuclear
factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and signal
transducer and activator of transcription-1alpha (STAT-1alpha) activation induced
by reactive oxygen species generation at 24 h. Lycopene, quercetin and tyrosol
inhibited all these effects. The results here reported suggest that these
compounds may represent non toxic agents for the control of pro-inflammatory
genes involved in celiac disease.

Pig conceptuses increase uterine interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), but
restrict expression to stroma through estrogen-induced IRF2 in luminal
epithelium.

Pig conceptuses secrete estrogen for pregnancy recognition, and they secrete
interferons (IFNs) gamma and delta during the peri-implantation period. The
uterine effects of pig IFNs are not known, although ruminant conceptuses secrete 
IFN tau for pregnancy recognition, and this increases the expression of
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the endometrium. In sheep, the transcriptional
repressor interferon-regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) is expressed in the endometrial
luminal epithelium (LE) and appears to restrict IFN tau induction of most ISGs,
including IRF1, to the stroma and glands. Interestingly, MX1, which is an ISG in 
sheep, is also expressed in the endometrial stroma of pregnant pigs. The
objective of the present study was to determine if estrogen and/or conceptus
secretory proteins (CSPs) that contain IFNs regulate IRF1 and IRF2 in pig
endometria. The endometrial levels of IRF1 and IRF2 were low throughout the
estrus cycle. After Day 12 of pregnancy, the levels of the classical ISGs, which 
include IRF1, STAT2, MIC, and B2M, increased in the overall endometrium, with
expression of IRF1 and STAT2 being specifically localized to the stroma. IRF2
increased in the LE after Day 12. To determine the effects of estrogen, pigs were
treated with 17 beta-estradiol benzoate (E2). To determine the CSP effects, pigs 
were treated with E2 and implanted with mini-osmotic pumps that delivered control
serum proteins (CX) to one ligated uterine horn and CSP to the other horn.
Estrogen increased the level of IRF2 in the endometrial LE. The administration of
E2 and infusion of CSP increased the level of IRF1 in the stroma. These results
suggest that conceptus estrogen induces IRF2 in the LE and limits the induction
of IRF1 by conceptus IFNs to the stroma. The cell-specific expression of IRF1 and
IRF2 in the pig endometrium highlights the complex and overlapping events that
are associated with gene expression during the peri-implantation period, when
pregnancy recognition signaling and uterine remodeling for implantation and
placentation are necessary for successful pregnancy.

The family of five: TIR-domain-containing adaptors in Toll-like receptor
signalling.

Ireland. laoneill@tcd.ie agbowie@tcd.ie

Signalling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) involves five adaptor proteins known as 
MyD88, MAL, TRIF, TRAM and SARM. Recent insights have revealed additional
functions for MyD88 apart from NF-kappaB activation, including activation of the 
transcription factors IRF1, IRF5 and IRF7, and also a role outside the TLRs in
interferon-gamma signalling. Biochemical information on MAL and TRAM has shown
that both act as bridging adaptors, with MAL recruiting MyD88 to TLR2 and TLR4,
and TRAM recruiting TRIF to TLR4 to allow for IRF3 activation. Finally, the
function of the fifth adaptor, SARM, has been revealed, which negatively
regulates TRIF. These new insights allow for a detailed description of the
function of the five TIR-domain-containing adaptors in the initiation of TLR
signalling.

Interferon regulatory factor-1-induced apoptosis mediated by a ligand-independent
fas-associated death domain pathway in breast cancer cells.

Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that has
apoptotic anti-tumor activity. In breast cancer cell types, IRF-1 is implicated
in mediating apoptosis by both novel and established anti-tumor agents, including
the anti-estrogens tamoxifen and faslodex. Here we demonstrate that in MDA468
breast cancer cells, apoptosis by IFN-gamma is mediated by IRF-1 and IFN-gamma,
and IRF-1-induced apoptosis is caspase-mediated. IRF-1 induction results in
cleavage of caspase-8, -3 and -7, and application of caspase inhibitors attenuate
activated cleavage products. IRF-1-induced apoptosis involves caspase-8 since
apoptosis is significantly decreased by the caspase-8-specific inhibitor IETD,
c-FLIP expression and in caspase-8-deficient cancer cells. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that IRF-1-induced apoptosis requires fas-associated death domain
(FADD) since dominant-negative FADD expressing cells resist IRF-1-induced
apoptosis and activated downstream products. Immunofluorescent studies
demonstrate perinuclear colocalization of FADD and caspase-8. Despite the known
role of FADD in mediating death-ligand induced apoptosis, neutralizing antibodies
against classical death receptors do not inhibit IRF-1 induced apoptosis, and no 
secreted ligand appears to be involved since MDA468 coincubated with IRF-1
transfected cells do not apoptose. Therefore, we demonstrate that IRF-1 induces a
ligand-independent FADD/caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

Toxoplasma gondii dysregulates IFN-gamma-inducible gene expression in human
fibroblasts: insights from a genome-wide transcriptional profiling.

Kim SK(1), Fouts AE, Boothroyd JC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of
Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that persists for the
life of a mammalian host. The parasite's ability to block the potent IFN-gamma
response may be one of the key mechanisms that allow Toxoplasma to persist. Using
a genome-wide microarray analysis, we show here a complete dysregulation of
IFN-gamma-inducible gene expression in human fibroblasts infected with
Toxoplasma. Notably, 46 of the 127 IFN-gamma-responsive genes were induced and 19
were suppressed in infected cells before they were exposed to IFN-gamma,
indicating that other stimuli produced during infection may also regulate these
genes. Following IFN-gamma treatment, none of the 127 IFN-gamma-responsive genes 
could be significantly induced in infected cells. Immunofluorescence assays
showed at single-cell levels that infected cells, regardless of which Toxoplasma 
strain was used, could not be activated by IFN-gamma to up-regulate the
expression of IFN regulatory factor 1, a transcription factor that is under the
direct control of STAT1, whereas uninfected cells in the same culture expressed
IFN regulatory factor 1 normally in response to IFN-gamma. STAT1 trafficked to
the nucleus normally and indistinguishably in all uninfected and infected cells
treated with IFN-gamma, indicating that the inhibitory effects of Toxoplasma
infection likely occur via blocking STAT1 transcriptional activity in the
nucleus. In contrast, a closely related apicomplexan, Neospora caninum, was
unable to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced gene expression. A differential ability to
interfere with the IFN-gamma response may, in part, account for the differences
in the pathogenesis seen among Toxoplasma and Neospora parasite strains.

An investigation of the porcine response to gastrointestinal infection with
Salmonella enterica serovars Choleraesuis (narrow host range) and Typhimurium
(broad host range) revealed markedly different transcriptional profiles. Seven
genes identified by suppression subtractive hybridization as up-regulated in the 
mesenteric lymph nodes at 24h (h) post-inoculation (p.i.) in serovar
Choleraesuis-infected pigs (ARPC2, CCT7, HSPH1, LCP1, PTMA, SDCBP, VCP) and three
genes in serovar Typhimurium-infected pigs (CD47/IAP, CXCL10, SCARB2) were
analyzed by real-time PCR at 8h, 24 h, 48 h, 7 days (d) and 21 d p.i. A
comparison between the two Salmonella infections revealed significant differences
in transcriptional induction early in the infection (8-24h) for the serovar
Typhimurium-infected pigs, whereas the serovar Choleraesuis-infected pigs
exhibited significantly higher levels of gene expression at the later time points
(48h-21 d), except for HSPH1. A similar gene expression trend was observed for
immune-related genes involved in innate immunity and the inflammatory T helper 1 
(Th1) response. Initial repression of gene expression in the serovar
Choleraesuis-infected pigs from 8 to 48h p.i. (IFNG, IL12A, IL4, IL8, CSF2)
coincided with extended transcriptional activation throughout the 21 d infection 
(IFNG, INDO, SOCS1, STAT1, IL1B, IL6, IL8, SLC11A1). The serovar
Typhimurium-infected swine presented a more transient induction of immune-related
genes (IFNG, INDO, IRF1, SOCS1, STAT1, IL1B, IL8, SLC11A1) early in the infection
(24-48 h) followed by a significant repression of IL12A, IL12B, IL4, IL8 and
CSF2. Collectively, these data reveal specific porcine genes with differences in 
gene expression kinetics that may be responsible for the variation in disease
progression observed in swine infected with Typhimurium compared to Choleraesuis.

OBJECTIVE: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) comprises several clinically
distinct subgroups and is the most widespread cause of chronic childhood
disability. A significant association between JIA and a polymorphism in the
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene has previously been reported,
implicating IRF1 in disease susceptibility. The aim of this study was to
replicate the IRF1 association in JIA using single-marker and haplotype analyses 
in a case-control study, using control subjects different from those in the
previous study and a larger cohort of patients (n = 765).
METHODS: DNA from 765 patients with JIA and 508 unaffected control subjects was
genotyped for 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IRF-1 gene. Association of
genotypes at the IRF1 loci was assessed using single-marker and haplotype
analyses.
RESULTS: No significant differences in genotype frequency or allele frequency
were observed between patients and control subjects.
CONCLUSION: This replication study used a much larger patient cohort to examine
the association of IRF1 in JIA. However, despite the increased statistical power,
we observed no significant association for IRF1 markers, either individually or
as haplotypes. It is therefore unlikely that this gene is involved in JIA
susceptibility.

Distinct mechanisms of loss of IFN-gamma mediated HLA class I inducibility in two
melanoma cell lines.

BACKGROUND: The inability of cancer cells to present antigen on the cell surface 
via MHC class I molecules is one of the mechanisms by which tumor cells evade
anti-tumor immunity. Alterations of Jak-STAT components of interferon
(IFN)-mediated signaling can contribute to the mechanism of cell resistance to
IFN, leading to lack of MHC class I inducibility. Hence, the identification of
IFN-gamma-resistant tumors may have prognostic and/or therapeutic relevance. In
the present study, we investigated a mechanism of MHC class I inducibility in
response to IFN-gamma treatment in human melanoma cell lines.
METHODS: Basal and IFN-induced expression of HLA class I antigens was analyzed by
means of indirect immunofluorescence flow cytometry, Western Blot, RT-PCR, and
quantitative real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan(R) Gene Expression Assays). In
demethylation studies cells were cultured with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was used to assay whether IRF-1
promoter binding activity is induced in IFN-gamma-treated cells.
RESULTS: Altered IFN-gamma mediated HLA-class I induction was observed in two
melanoma cells lines (ESTDAB-004 and ESTDAB-159) out of 57 studied, while
treatment of these two cell lines with IFN-alpha led to normal induction of HLA
class I antigen expression. Examination of STAT-1 in ESTDAB-004 after IFN-gamma
treatment demonstrated that the STAT-1 protein was expressed but not
phosphorylated. Interestingly, IFN-alpha treatment induced normal STAT-1
phosphorylation and HLA class I expression. In contrast, the absence of response 
to IFN-gamma in ESTDAB-159 was found to be associated with alterations in
downstream components of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: We observed two distinct mechanisms of loss of IFN-gamma inducibility
of HLA class I antigens in two melanoma cell lines. Our findings suggest that
loss of HLA class I induction in ESTDAB-004 cells results from a defect in the
earliest steps of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway due to absence of STAT-1
tyrosine-phosphorylation, while absence of IFN-gamma-mediated HLA class I
expression in ESTDAB-159 cells is due to epigenetic blocking of IFN-regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1) transactivation.

BACKGROUND: Computational analysis of gene regulatory regions is important for
prediction of functions of many uncharacterized genes. With this in mind, search 
of the target genes for interferon (IFN) induction appears of interest. IFNs are 
multi-functional cytokines. Their effects are immunomodulatory, antiviral,
antibacterial, and antitumor. The interaction of the IFNs with their cell surface
receptors produces an activation of several transcription factors. Four
regulatory factors, ISGF3, STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB, are essential for the
function of the IFN system. The aim of this work is the development of
computational approaches for the recognition of DNA binding sites for these
factors and computer programs for the prediction of the IFN-inducible regions.
RESULTS: We developed computational approaches to the recognition of the binding 
sites for ISGF3, STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB. Analysis of the distribution of
these binding sites demonstrated that the regions -500 upstream of the
transcription start site in IFN-inducible genes are enriched in putative binding 
sites for these transcription factors. Based on selected combinations of the
sites whose frequencies were significantly higher than in the other functional
gene groups, we developed methods for the prediction of the IFN-inducible
promoters and enhancers. We analyzed 1004 sequences of the IFN-inducible genes
compiled using microarray data analyses and also about 10,000 human gene
sequences from the EPD and RefSeq databases; 74 of 1,664 human genes annotated in
EPD were significantly IFN-inducible.
CONCLUSION: Analyses of several control datasets demonstrated that the developed 
methods have a high accuracy of prediction of the IFN-inducible genes.
Application of these methods to several datasets suggested that the number of the
IFN-inducible genes is approximately 1500-2000 in the human genome.

A subgroup of genes induced by IFN-gamma requires both STAT1 and IRF1 for
transcriptional activation. Using WT, stat1(-/-), or irf1(-/-) cells, we analyzed
the changes induced by IFN-gamma in gbp2 promoter chromatin. STAT1 associated
with the promoter independently of IRF1 and played an essential role in the
ordered recruitment of the coactivator/histone acetyl transferase CREB-binding
protein (CBP) and the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Hyperacetylation of histone 4
also required STAT1. Phosphorylation at S727 in the transactivating domain
increased transcriptional activity of STAT1. In cells expressing a
STAT1S727A-mutant CBP recruitment, histone 4 hyperacetylation and RNA polymerase 
II association with the gbp2 promoter were strongly reduced. IRF1 association
with the gbp2 promoter followed that of STAT1, but STAT1 association with DNA or 
histone hyperacetylation were not necessary for IRF1 binding. RNA polymerase II
association with the gbp2 promoter required both STAT1 and IRF1, suggesting that 
both proteins mediate essential steps in transcriptional activation. IRF1, but
not STAT1, was found to coimmunoprecipitate with RNA polymerase II. Together, the
data support the assumption that the main role of STAT1 in activating gbp2
transcription is to provide transcriptionally competent chromatin, whereas the
function of IRF1 may lie in directly contacting RNA polymerase II-containing
transcriptional complexes.

IL-18 is involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and
allergic contact dermatitis. CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 recruit type 1 T cells,
and the production of these chemokines by keratinocytes is enhanced in these
dermatoses. We examined the in vitro effects of IL-18 on IFN-gamma-induced CXCL9,
CXCL10, and CXCL11 production in human keratinocytes. IL-18 enhanced the
IFN-gamma-induced secretion and mRNA expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in
parallel to the activation of NF-kappaB, STAT1, and IFN-regulatory factor
(IRF)-1. Antisense oligonucleotides against NF-kappaB p50, p65, or STAT1
suppressed CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 production, and antisense IRF-1 suppressed
CXCL11 production. Inhibitors of PI3 K, p38 MAPK, and MEK suppressed IL-18 plus
IFN-gamma-induced CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 production and NF-kappaB, STAT1, and 
IRF-1 activities. IL-18 induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, while IFN-gamma
induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. These results suggest that IL-18 may
potentiate IFN-gamma-induced CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 production in
keratinocytes by activating NF-kappaB, STAT1, or IRF-1 through PI3 K/Akt and
MEK/ERK pathways. These effects of IL-18 may promote the infiltration of type 1 T
cells into lesions with inflammatory dermatoses and amplify the skin
inflammation. IL-18 may act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in these dermatoses
and thus is a candidate therapeutic target.

The activated form of vitamin D(3), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)),
plays an important role in the immune system. Indeed, receptors for
1,25(OH)(2)D(3) are found on most immune cells, and 1alpha-hydroxylase, the
enzyme responsible for final activation of vitamin D(3), is expressed by
monocytes/macrophages, resulting in secretion of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) after immune
stimulation. We have previously shown that in murine peritoneal macrophages
1alpha-hydroxylase is highly regulated by immune signals such as IFNgamma and
LPS. In the present study we made use of two different knock-out mouse models
with disruptions in two key transcription factors in the IFNgamma-signalling
cascade (STAT1alpha and IRF1), to evaluate their role in the regulation of
1alpha-hydroxylase. This was performed by culturing peritoneal macrophages from
these knock-out mice in the presence of IFNgamma and LPS, and evaluating the
impact of the absence of the respective transcription factors on
1alpha-hydroxylase mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR. In addition also the mRNA
expression profiles of the essential transcription factors STAT1alpha, IRF1 and
C/EBPbeta were investigated. The data confirm a crucial role for STAT1alpha as
well as for C/EBPbeta in the regulation of 1alpha-hydroxylase in monocytes.

Although the general association of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 5 region
on chromosome 5q31 to Crohn's disease (CD) has been replicated repeatedly, the
identity of the precise causal variant within the region remains unknown. A
recent report proposed polymorphisms in solute carrier family 22, member 4
(SLC22A4) organic cation transporter 1(OCTN1) and solute carrier family 22,
member 5 (SLC22A5) (OCTN2) as responsible for the IBD5 association, but
definitive, large-sample comparison of those polymorphisms with others known to
be in strong linkage disequilibrium was not performed. We evaluated 1879 affected
offspring and parents ascertained by a North American IBD Genetics Consortium for
six IBD5 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to evaluate association
localization and ethnic and subphenotypic specificity. We confirm association to 
the IBD5 region (best SNP IGR2096a_1/rs12521868, P<0.0005) and show this
association to be exclusive to the non-Jewish (NJ) population (P=0.00005) (risk
allele undertransmitted in Ashkenazi Jews). Using Phase II HapMap data, we
demonstrate that there are a set of polymorphisms, spanning genes from prolyl
4-hydroxylase (P4HA2) through interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) with
equivalent statistical evidence of association to the reported SLC22A4 variant
and that each, by itself, could entirely explain the IBD5 association to CD.
Additionally, the previously reported SLC22A5 SNP is rejected as the potential
causal variant. No specificity of association was seen with respect to disease
type and location, and a modest association to ulcerative colitis is also
observed. We confirm the importance of IBD5 to CD susceptibility, demonstrate
that the locus may play a role in NJ individuals only, and establish that IRF1,
PDLIM, and P4HA2 may be equally as likely to contain the IBD5 causal variant as
the OCTN genes.

IFNs selectively regulate gene expression through several signaling pathways. The
present study explored the involvement of STAT3 in the IFN-induced expression of 
the gene encoding the CXCL11 chemokine. The CXCL11 gene was induced in
IFN-sensitive Daudi cells, but not in an IFN-resistant DRST3 subline with a
defective STAT3 signaling pathway. Although the IFN-stimulated gene ISG15 was
induced to a similar extent in Daudi and DRST3 cells, expression of wild-type
STAT3 in DRST3 cells restored the IFN inducibility of CXCL11. Reconstitution of
STAT3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type STAT3, or STAT3 with
the canonical STAT3 dimerization site at Y705 mutated, restored IFN inducibility 
of the CXCL11 gene. These data indicate that CXCL11 gene induction by IFN is
STAT3 dependent, but that phosphorylation of Y705 of STAT3 is not required.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that IFN treatment of Daudi and
DRST3 cells induced STAT3 binding to the CXCL11 promoter. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that NF-kappaB family member p65 and IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)1 were bound to CXCL11 promoter upon IFN treatment of
Daudi cells. In contrast, IFN induced the binding of p50 and IRF2 to the CXCL11
promoter in DRST3 cells. The profile of promoter binding was indistinguishable in
IFN-sensitive Daudi cells and DRST3 cells reconstituted with wild-type STAT3.
Thus, STAT3 also plays a role in the recruitment of the transcriptional
activators p65 and IRF1, and the displacement of the transcriptional repressors
p50 and IRF2 from the CXCL11 promoter also appears to regulate the induction of
CXCL11 gene transcription.

CCL19 chemokine has a central role in dendritic cell (DC) biology regulating DC
traffic and recruitment of naive T cells to the vicinity of activated DCs. In
this study, we have analyzed the regulation of CCL19 gene expression in human
monocyte-derived DCs. DCs infected with Salmonella enterica or Sendai virus
produced CCL19 at late times of infection. The CCL19 promoter was identified as
having two putative NF-kappaB binding sites and one IFN-stimulated response
element (ISRE). Transcription factor binding experiments demonstrated that
Salmonella or Sendai virus infection increased the binding of classical p50+p65
and alternative p52+RelB NF-kappaB proteins to both of the CCL19 promoter
NF-kappaB elements. Interestingly, Salmonella or Sendai virus infection also
increased the binding of multiple IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), STAT1, and
STAT2, to the ISRE element. Enhanced binding of IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, and IRF9 to the
CCL19 promoter ISRE site was detected in Salmonella or Sendai virus-infected cell
extracts. The CCL19 promoter in a luciferase reporter construct was activated by 
the expression of NF-kappaB p50+p65 or p52+RelB dimers. IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7
proteins also activated CCL19 promoter in the presence of Sendai virus infection.
CCL19 promoter constructs mutated at NF-kappaB and/or ISRE sites were only weakly
activated. Ectopic expression of RIG-I (DeltaRIG-I, CARDIF) or TLR3/4 (TRIF,
MyD88, IKKepsilon, or TBK1) signaling pathway components induced CCL19 promoter
activity, suggesting that these pathways are important in CCL19 gene expression. 
Our experiments reveal that expression of the CCL19 gene is regulated by a
combined action of several members of the NF-kappaB, IRF, and STAT family
transcription factors.

Interferon-beta is a potent inducer of interferon regulatory factor-1/2-dependent
IP-10/CXCL10 expression in primary human endothelial cells.

Most virus-infected cells release interferon-beta (IFN-beta) as a powerful
inducer of antiviral defense. Endothelial cells tightly regulate local immune
cell recruitment by expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines. Here, we
studied the transcriptional regulation of IFN-beta-induced chemokine expression
in primary human endothelial cells. IFN-beta moderately increased monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1/CCL2 and potently raised IFN-gamma-inducible
protein-10/CXCL10 mRNA steady-state levels and protein release, while no effect
was detected on various other chemokines. As shown by transient transfections,
induction of CXCL10 expression depends on an IFN-stimulated response element
(ISRE) within the CXCL10 promoter. A double point mutation of the putative IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)-1/2 binding site within this ISRE motif abolished
IFN-beta-induced promoter activity. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
this ISRE motif showed a basal IRF-2 and an IFN-beta-inducible IRF-1 and
augmented IRF-2 binding. Furthermore, stimulation with IFN-beta induced a rapid
nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
(STAT1) and STAT2 and their transient binding to a gamma-activated site within
the CCL2 promoter. The kinetics of transient STAT1 binding to this
gamma-activated site element correlated with the amount of Y701-phosphorylated
nuclear STAT1, while S727-phosphorylated nuclear STAT1 remained stable over 24 h 
after stimulation. Therefore, IFN-beta potently induces endothelial chemokine
expression at the transcriptional level.

IFN-gamma upregulates expression of the mouse complement C1rA gene in
keratinocytes via IFN-regulatory factor-1.

We examined the expression of the mouse complement component C1rA (mC1rA) in
IFN-gamma-stimulated mouse keratinocytes (Pam 212) and found that it was
upregulated. To analyze the mechanism involved, we cloned the 2,150 bp
5'-flanking region of mC1rA by the vectorette-PCR technique, and identified the
transcription start site of mC1rA by rapid amplification of complementary DNA
ends. Analysis of the 5' sequence revealed putative binding sites for activator
protein 1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), signal transducer and
activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1), IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and
others. We detected transcriptional activation dependent on this upstream region 
in reporter gene assays and Northern blots. To identify the cis-acting regulatory
elements involved, we analyzed serial deletion constructs of the promoter using
luciferase reporters. The -80 to -19 bp region, which contains a putative IRF-1
binding site, was required for both basal promoter activity and responses to
IFN-gamma. The use of site-directed point mutations, electrophoresis mobility
shift assays, and supershift assays indicated that the putative IRF-1 binding
site was essential for both IFN-gamma-dependent and -independent transcriptional 
activity of the mC1rA promoter. We conclude that IFN-gamma stimulates mC1rA gene 
expression via IRF-1 in mouse keratinocytes.

endothelial cells.

The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is central to the etiology of
endothelial dysfunction in sepsis. Endothelial cells respond to infection by
activating NADPH oxidases that are sources of intracellular ROS and potential
targets for therapeutic administration of antioxidants. Ascorbate is an
antioxidant that accumulates in these cells and improves capillary blood flow,
vascular reactivity, arterial blood pressure, and survival in experimental
sepsis. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that ascorbate
regulates NADPH oxidases in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to septic
insult. We observed that incubation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) increased NADPH oxidase activity and
expression of the enzyme subunit p47phox in mouse microvascular endothelial cells
of skeletal muscle origin. Pretreatment of the cells with ascorbate prevented
these increases. Polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase and selective inhibitors
of Jak2 also abrogated induction of p47phox. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide induced 
p47phox expression that was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with
ascorbate. LPS+IFNgamma or hydrogen peroxide activated the Jak2/Stat1/IRF1
pathway and this effect was also inhibited by ascorbate. In conclusion, ascorbate
blocks the stimulation by septic insult of redox-sensitive Jak2/Stat1/IRF1
signaling, p47phox expression, and NADPH oxidase activity in microvascular
endothelial cells. Because endothelial NADPH oxidases produce ROS that can cause 
endothelial dysfunction, their inhibition by ascorbate may represent a new
strategy for sepsis therapy.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common form of leukaemia in adults.
Although of the order of 75-85% of patients will achieve complete remission after
induction chemotherapy, long-term survival is still relatively low. Despite the
progress in the rational design of drugs in disorders such as chronic myeloid
leukaemia, AML lacks a single specific pathogenomic event to act as a drug
target. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is a member of a family of related 
proteins that act as transcriptional activators or repressors. IRF1 and its
functional antagonist IRF2 originally discovered as transcription factors
regulating the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene, are involved in the regulation of
normal haematopoiesis and leukaemogenesis. IRF1 appears to act as a tumour
suppressor gene and IRF2 as an oncogene. IRF1 acts to repress IRF2 function
through the repression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21WAF1
critical for cell growth control. It appears that the tumour suppression function
of IRF1 is abolished by IRF2. This review focuses on the interaction between IRF1
and IRF2 in myeloid development and leukaemogenesis, particularly in relation to 
the Ras signalling pathway. IRF2 may be a viable and specific therapeutic target 
in human leukaemia.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins are known to interfere at several levels with
both innate and adaptive responses of the host. A key target in these effects is 
the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. While the effects of nonstructural
proteins are well established, the role of structural proteins remains
controversial. We investigated the effect of HCV structural proteins on the
expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a secondary transcription
factor of the IFN system responsible for inducing several key antiviral and
immunomodulatory genes. We found substantial inhibition of IRF-1 expression in
cells expressing the entire HCV replicon. Suppression of IRF-1 synthesis was
mainly mediated by the core structural protein and occurred at the
transcriptional level. The core protein in turn exerted a transcriptional
repression of several interferon-stimulated genes, targets of IRF-1, including
interleukin-15 (IL-15), IL-12, and low-molecular-mass polypeptide 2. These data
recapitulate in a unifying mechanism, i.e., repression of IRF-1 expression, many 
previously described pathogenetic effects of HCV core protein and suggest that
HCV core-induced IRF-1 repression may play a pivotal role in establishing
persistent infection by dampening an effective immune response.

Transcription factor paralogs may share a common role in staged or overlapping
expression in specific tissues, as in the Hox family. In other cases, family
members have distinct roles in a range of embryologic, differentiation or
response pathways (as in the Tbx and Pax families). For the interferon regulatory
factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, mice deficient in Irf1, Irf2, Irf3,
Irf4, Irf5, Irf7, Irf8 or Irf9 have defects in the immune response but show no
embryologic abnormalities. Mice deficient for Irf6 have not been reported, but in
humans, mutations in IRF6 cause two mendelian orofacial clefting syndromes, and
genetic variation in IRF6 confers risk for isolated cleft lip and palate. Here we
report that mice deficient for Irf6 have abnormal skin, limb and craniofacial
development. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that the primary 
defect is in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. This study describes
a new role for an IRF family member in epidermal development.

We previously identified a 1.2 Kb DNA element (P-1161/+16), 5' to caspase-8
exon-1, that acts as promoter in caspase-8-positive, but not in
caspase-8-negative neuroblastoma (NB) cells. The P-1161/+16 DNA element regulates
both constitutive and interferon IFN-gamma-inducible caspase-8 expression. Two
GAS (IFN-activated sequence, STAT-1 binding site) and two ISRE (interferon
sensitive response element, IRF binding site) were present in P-1161/+16.
Deletion studies indicated that elements essential for promoter activity in NB
cells were present in a 167 bp region 5' flanking exon-1 (P-151/+16), which
contains an ISRE at position -32. The transcription initiation site was mapped by
5' rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) at position -20 from caspase-8 cDNA
reference sequence. Disruption of the ISRE-32 indicated that it is required for
both constitutive and IFN-gamma-inducible caspase-8 expression. IRF-1 and IRF-2
transcription factors bind to the (-151/+16) DNA fragment in vitro. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that IRF-1 and IRF-2 bind to the DNA
region at the 5' of caspase-8 gene in NB cells, which show constitutive
expression but not in caspase-8 negative cells. In these last cells,
up-regulation of caspase-8 by IFN-gamma was associated to induction of IRF-1 and 
IRF-2 binding to caspase-8 promoter and increased histone acetylation. Moreover, 
RNA interference experiments also supported the involvement of IRF-1 and IRF-2 in
constitutive caspase-8 expression in NB cells.

The recognition of microbial components by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiates
signal transduction pathways, which trigger the expression of a series of target 
genes. It has been reported that TLR signaling is enhanced by cytokines such as
IFN-gamma, but the mechanisms underlying this enhancement remain unclear. The
MyD88 adaptor, which is essential for signaling by many TLRs, recruits members of
the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, such as IRF5 and
IRF7, to evoke the activation of TLR target genes. In this study we demonstrate
that IRF1, which is induced by IFN-gamma, also interacts with and is activated by
MyD88 upon TLR activation. We provide evidence that MyD88-associated IRF1
migrates into the nucleus more efficiently than non-MyD88-associated IRF1 and
that this IRF1 selectively participates in the TLR-dependent gene induction
program. The critical role of MyD88-dependent "IRF1 licensing" is underscored by 
the observation that the induction of a specific gene subset downstream of the
TLR-MyD88 pathway, such as IFN-beta, inducible NO synthase, and IL-12p35, are
impaired in Irf1-deficient cells. Thus, our present study places IRF1 as an
additional member participating in MyD88 signaling and provides a mechanistic
insight into the enhancement of the TLR-dependent gene induction program by
IFN-gamma.

Association of interferon-gamma and interferon regulatory factor 1 polymorphisms 
with asthma in a family-based association study in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a multi-factorial disorder caused by complex interactions
between genetic and environmental factors. IFN-gamma and IFN regulatory factor 1 
(IRF-1) affect Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, and influence the differentiation of Th2
cells, which influence the development of asthma.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated CA repeats polymorphism of the IFN-gamma gene 
and GT repeats polymorphism of the IRF-1 gene, which may predispose individuals
to asthma pathogenesis.
METHODS: In the present study, we used the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT)
to investigate the relationship between asthma and the IFN-gamma and IRF-1
polymorphisms by studying 348 subjects composed of 232 parents and 116 asthmatic 
children.
RESULTS: For global TDT test, IFN-gamma CA repeats and IRF-1 GT repeat
polymorphisms showed a significant association with asthma in children (P=0.009
and 0.017, respectively). We demonstrated that 13 CA repeats (138 bp) of
IFN-gamma gene and 11 GT repeats (306 bp) of IRF-1 gene are significantly
preferentially transmitted to asthmatic children (T/NT=89/61, chi2=8.43, P<0.005 
and T/NT=75/49, chi2=8.18, P<0.005, respectively). The offspring will have an
increased risk of asthma when their parents transmit IFN-gamma 13 CA repeats
(OR=1.83, P=0.009) and IRF1 11 GT repeats (OR=1.88, P=0.007) to them. But we
observed that the IFN-gamma and IRF-1 polymorphisms are not associated with IgE
concentrations.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide strong evidence of which IFN-gamma CA repeat
and IRF-1 GT repeat polymorphisms influence the risk of asthma for children in
Taiwan.

The natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is probably related to
host immune factors. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plays significant roles in
immune defense. This study was undertaken to investigate the association between 
HBV infection and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma 
receptor (IFNGR)-1 and 2, and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 genes. Between
March 2002 and December 2002, 614 Korean patients were enrolled in two different 
groups: an HBV clearance group (n = 201), who were hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) negative with antibodies to HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen, and an
HBV persistence group (n = 413), who were repeatedly HBsAg positive. We assessed 
polymorphisms in the IFN-gamma gene at position +874, in the IFNGR-1 gene at
positions -56 and +95, in the IFNGR-2 gene at the second position of codon 64
(Gln64Arg), and in the IRF-1 gene promoter (-410, -388), and the genotype
distributions of the HBV clearance and persistence groups were compared. On the
basis of unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and
sex, no statistically significant association with susceptibility to persistent
HBV infection was observed with the IFN-gamma, IFNGR-1 and 2, and IRF-1 gene
polymorphisms under the codominant, dominant, and recessive models.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from core
histones. Because of their capacity to induce local condensation of chromatin,
HDACs are generally considered repressors of transcription. In this report, we
analyzed the role of the class I histone deacetylase HDAC1 as a transcriptional
regulator by comparing the expression profiles of wild-type and HDAC1-deficient
embryonic stem cells. A specific subset of mouse genes (7%) was deregulated in
the absence of HDAC1. We identified several putative tumor suppressors (JunB,
Prss11, and Plagl1) and imprinted genes (Igf2, H19, and p57) as novel HDAC1
targets. The majority of HDAC1 target genes showed reduced expression accompanied
by recruitment of HDAC1 and local reduction in histone acetylation at regulatory 
regions. At some target genes, the related deacetylase HDAC2 partially masks the 
loss of HDAC1. A second group of genes was found to be downregulated in
HDAC1-deficient cells, predominantly by additional recruitment of HDAC2 in the
absence of HDAC1. Finally, a small set of genes (Gja1, Irf1, and Gbp2) was found 
to require HDAC activity and recruitment of HDAC1 for their transcriptional
activation. Our study reveals a regulatory cross talk between HDAC1 and HDAC2 and
a novel function for HDAC1 as a transcriptional coactivator.

Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells constitute the external part of the
blood-retinal-barrier and play a pivotal role in the regulation of retinal
immunity. In the present work, we investigated the effects of
15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15 PGJ2), an endogenous ligand of PPARgamma, on 
the IFNgamma-induced expression of MHC class II on RPE cells. Indeed,
pathological expression of MHC class II molecules at the surface of RPE cells is 
a common feature of many blinding conditions. We demonstrated that 15 PGJ2
inhibited the IFNgamma-mediated induction of MHC class II on RPE cells without
affecting the level of MHC class I and CD54 expression. The other PPARgamma
agonist rosiglitazone or troglitazone had no similar effects. Moreover, the
inhibitory effect of 15 PGJ2 was not abrogated by co-incubation with PPARgamma
antagonists and did not involve the modulation of STAT-1, AKT or ERK1/2
phosphorylation, nor CIITA, IRF1 or IRF2 transcription. In conclusion, 15 PGJ2
inhibits strongly and specifically the IFNgamma-induced MHC class II expression
on RPE cells by a PPARgamma independent mechanism. Given the differential role of
MHC classes I and II in the development of autoimmune uveitis and the potential
toxicity of 15 PGJ2, our data's suggest that the development of novel small
molecules targeting similar PPARgamma independent pathways would be useful for
the future management of uveitis.

Comparative effects of interferon-gamma and all- trans retinoic acid on secreted 
and surface-associated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression of human monocytes.

France.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 is involved in inflammation and tumor progression. We 
previously demonstrated that interferon type I (alpha/beta) and II (gamma)
inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-9 (92kDa) gene expression on lymphocytes from
patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia and human monocytes. Since all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) can regulate some interferon -responsive genes, we studied
here the effects of all-trans retinoic acid onto matrix metalloproteinase-9
levels in these cells. By using RT-PCR, ELISA and zymography experiments, we
showed that all-trans retinoic acid down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9
synthesis (mRNA,protein) and secretion. The inhibitory action of all-trans
retinoic acid toward matrix metalloproteinase-9 was however not associated with
the STAT1/IRF-1 pathway involved in interferon-mediated matrix
metalloproteinase-9 inhibition indicating that all-trans retinoic acid did not
bypass IFN receptor signaling. Using flow cytometry, we detected on the surface
of monocytes low expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and Fc-gammaRI, and
high expression of HLA-DR, beta1 and beta2 integrins. Enhancement of Fc-gammaRI
and HLA-DR on monocytes by interferon-gamma, but not by all-trans retinoic acid, 
was accompanied by up-regulation of surface matrix metalloproteinase-9.
Furthermore, we showed that all-trans retinoic acid down-regulated matrix
metalloproteinase-9 expression in lymphocytes of untreated patients with early
stage B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Together, our data suggest the potential
relevance of all-trans retinoic acid as a pharmacological tool to attenuate
matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion in pathological situations.

[Method SiteGA for the recognition of transcription factor binding sites].

[Article in Russian]

Levitskii VG, Ignat'eva EV, Anan'ko EA, Merkulova TI, Kolchanov NA, Hodgman TC.

A new approach, SiteGA, for the prediction of functional transcription factor
binding sites has been developed. The approach is based on the detection of
locally positioned dinucleotides by the genetic algorithm and discriminant
analysis. The approach has been applied to recognize transcription factor binding
sites involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell growth (AP-1, IRF1,
ISGF3, NFkappaB, STAT1), obesity and lipid metabolism (HNF4, PPAR, SREBP), and
the expression of steroidogenesis genes (SF-1). SiteGA is far superior in
accuracy to the traditionally used method of position weight matrices. The
approach was implemented in the web tool, SiteGA http://wwwmgs2.

Single-stranded RNA viruses inactivate the transcriptional activity of p53 but
induce NOXA-dependent apoptosis via post-translational modifications of IRF-1,
IRF-3 and CREB.

France. lalleman@vjf.cnrs.fr

To characterize the mechanisms underlying apoptosis induced by viral infection,
transcriptional activation of genes encoding members of the 'BH3-only' family of 
proteins was analysed during the course of virus infection. Among these genes,
only NOXA is transcriptionally activated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV),
sendai virus (SV), measles virus, herpes simplex virus, or dsRNA and required for
efficient apoptosis of cells. Transcriptional activation of NOXA by VSV or SV is 
independent of p53, but requires the presence of interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF-1), IRF-3 and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Binding to and
transactivation of the NOXA promoter by each of these transcription factors is
governed by post-translational modification involving different pathways for each
factor. Thus, SV infection activates IRF-3 and CREB by phosphorylation triggered 
by Toll like receptor 3 signalling, and a pathway involving calcium-independent
phopholipase A2, respectively. In addition transactivation induced by IRF-1
during viral infection correlates with a 10 kDa increase in its molecular weight,
suggesting a covalent linkage with a previously unknown regulatory polypeptide.

Differential regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme and
angiotensin-converting enzyme by type I and II interferons in human normal and
leukemic myeloid cells.

The transmembrane metalloproteases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) have been
associated with inflammation, cancer progression and angiogenesis. Few
investigations into the regulation of these enzymes by physiological stimuli have
been reported. In this study, we investigated the influence of interferons (IFNs)
type I (alpha, beta) and II (gamma) on ACE and TACE expression of human leukemic 
NB4 cells and monocytes. We assessed the expression of proteases by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
immunofluorescence analyses. IFNgamma, but not type I IFNs, upregulated membrane 
ACE in a dose- and time-dependency and this was reflected by the increase of ACE 
enzymatic activity and ACE mRNA. ACE upregulation was dependent on protein
synthesis. Treatment of the interferon responsive factor 1 (IRF1)-unresponsive
HepG2 cell line with IFNgamma did not affect ACE expression, thus suggesting the 
participation of the IRF1 signaling pathway in IFNgamma-mediated ACE upregulation
in myeloid cells. In contrast, both types of IFNs, in a dose- and time-dependent 
manner, downregulated surface TACE without affecting TACE transcript. Soluble
TACE was not detected in the medium of IFN-treated cells. IFNgamma-mediated
decrease of surface TACE in NB4 cells was reversible, and correlated with an
increase in intracellular TACE, suggesting that cell surface TACE was
internalized in response to IFNs. These findings, showing the presence of
IFN-dependent controlled mechanisms by which ACE and TACE levels are regulated in
human normal and leukemic myeloid cells, may have implications in the context of 
current investigations on the therapeutic potential of IFNs.

Canada. msilverberg@mtsinai.on.ca

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory disorders of the
gastrointestinal tract with a substantial heritable component. The IBD5 region on
chromosome 5q31 is one of only two loci widely confirmed to be associated with
Crohn's disease in multiple independent cohorts. Although many populations have
demonstrated association with IBD5, there remains uncertainty as to the causal
variant within the region. A recent report identified polymorphisms in SLC22A4
(OCTN1) and SLC22A5 (OCTN2) as being responsible for the IBD5 association,
however, these findings have not been replicated. This review discusses the data 
evaluating the IBD5 locus and the OCTN genes and their relationship to
inflammatory bowel disease. Several other genes, including IRF1 and P4HA2 may be 
equally as likely to contain the IBD5 causal variant as the OCTN genes.

MEK-ERK signaling is involved in interferon-gamma-induced death of
oligodendroglial progenitor cells.

Oligodendrocytes are exposed to various cytokines in inflammatory lesions in the 
central nervous system. In this study, we focused on the direct effects of
interferon-gamma (IFNG) on highly purified rat oligodendroglial cultures at
different developmental stages. Among the three stages tested, IFNG had direct
cytotoxic effects on actively proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors but much 
less on immature oligodendrocytes and none on mature oligodendrocytes. This
stage-specific susceptibility of progenitors to IFNG-induced cytotoxicity
consisted of two components, delay in the G(1)/S transition of the cell cycle and
increased cell death at least partly mediated by apoptosis, suggesting that
progression of the cell cycle was tightly linked to this toxic mechanism. There
was no functional difference in the signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT) pathways between progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes as 
determined by induction of IRF1 mRNA in response to IFNG. We found that partial
inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway, one of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphorelay modules, by U0126 partially reversed the IFNG-induced cytotoxicity
in progenitors. In addition, ERK activity was quickly down-regulated after in
vitro differentiation of progenitors to immature oligodendrocytes. Therefore, we 
concluded that simultaneous activation of the STAT pathway by IFNG and of the ERK
pathway by exogenous trophic factors played a role in the stage-specific
IFNG-induced cytotoxicity in oligodendroglial progenitors. Our study has
implications with respect to the mechanisms of periventricular leukomalacia in
infants and of persistent demyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions in adults.

Chromosome 5q31 contains a cluster of genes involved in immune response,
including a 250 kb risk haplotype associated with Crohn's disease (CD)
susceptibility. Recently, two functional variants in SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 (L503F
and G-207C), encoding the cation transporters OCTN1 and OCTN2, were proposed as
causal variants for CD, but with conflicting genetic evidence regarding their
contribution. We investigated this locus by resequencing the coding regions of 10
genes in 24 CD cases and deriving a linkage disequilibrium (LD) map of the 27
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected. Ten SNPs representative of the
LD groups observed, were tested for CD association. L503F in SLC22A4 was the only
nonsynonymous SNP significantly associated with CD (P=0.003), but was not
associated with disease in the absence of other markers of the 250 kb risk
haplotype. Two other SNPs, rs11242115 in IRF1 and rs17166050 in RAD50, lying
outside the 250 kb risk haplotype, also showed CD association (P=0.019 and
P=0.0080, respectively). The RAD50 gene contains a locus control region
regulating expression of the Th2 cytokine genes at this locus. Other as yet
undiscovered SNPs in this region may therefore modulate gene expression and
contribute to the risk of CD, and perhaps of other inflammatory phenotypes.

RTG-P1 cells are a rainbow trout fibroblastic cell line permanently transfected
with the luciferase gene under the control of the Mx promoter. On exposure to
interferon (IFN) or IFN inducing agents, the cells produce luciferase. IPNV did
not induce luciferase production up to 24h post-infection but did not suppress
constitutive luciferase production. Furthermore, IPNV suppressed luciferase
production induced by poly I:C. RT-PCR analysis of IPNV infected cells showed IFN
gene transcription from 6h post-infection with increasing expression up to 24h.
Housekeeping genes beta-actin and GAPDH were also expressed along with
upregulation of IRF1 and slight upregulation of STAT1. When RTG-P1 cells were
stimulated with IFN, Mx transcripts, measured by qRT-PCR, peaked at 3-6h and
thereafter fell to low levels, but in the presence of IPNV, Mx transcription at
this time was significantly suppressed but continued to rise gradually.
Luciferase production was lower in infected cells at 12h post-infection but not
significantly after 24h. These results indicate that, in non-stimulated RTG-P1
cells, while IPNV induces IFN transcription, activation of Mx expression is
suppressed. Furthermore, when stimulated by IFN, the rate of Mx transcription is 
significantly suppressed by the virus. This would probably give time for the
virus to replicate rapidly in the early phases of infection. Contrary to the
fibroblastic cell line, IPNV stimulated IFN production by salmon macrophages in
vitro at least as strongly as poly I:C, with no suppression of the IFN response
to poly I:C, and the virus persisted for up to 9 days without causing CPE.

BACKGROUND: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is associated with
cardiovascular disease. Macrophages contribute to LDL oxidation, and oxidized LDL
(oxLDL) affects macrophage function. We searched for the strongest gene
correlates of oxLDL in macrophages in coronary plaques and studied the effect of 
oxLDL on their expression in THP-1 cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene expression in macrophages isolated from coronary plaque
macrophages from hypercholesterolemic swine was measured on Agilent Human cDNA
microarrays. Compared with a universal reference, 1653 transcripts were
deregulated. The expression of 11 genes correlated positively and the expression 
of 5 genes correlated negatively with plaque oxLDL. Interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF1; R2 = 0.69) and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2; R2 = 0.18) were the
strongest positive correlates of oxLDL. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) was the
strongest inverse correlate of oxLDL (R2 = 0.57). Immunohistochemical analysis
showed colocalization of IRF1, TLR2, and SOD1 protein in macrophages and
confirmed the RNA expression data. OxLDL-induced foam cell formation in THP-1
macrophages was associated with increased expression of IRF1 and TLR2 and
decreased expression of SOD1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that oxLDL is a proinflammatory
stimulus that induces the expression of TLR2 and IRF1, 2 important gene
regulators of innate immune response, and inhibits the expression of the
antioxidant SOD1.

Retinoic acid exerts dual regulatory actions on the expression and nuclear
localization of interferon regulatory factor-1.

Luo XM(1), Ross AC.

(1)Department of Nutritional Sciences, 126-S Henderson Building, University Park,
PA 16802, USA.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor and tumor
suppressor involved in cell growth regulation and immune responses, has been
shown to be induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the factors
controlling the cellular location and activity of IRF-1 are not well understood. 
In this study, we examined the expression of IRF-1 and its nuclear localization, 
DNA-binding activity, and target gene expression in human mammary epithelial
MCF10A cells, a model of breast epithelial cell differentiation and
carcinogenesis. Following initial treatment with ATRA, IRF-1 mRNA and protein
were induced within 2 hrs, reached a peak (>30-fold induction) at 8 hrs, and
declined afterwards. IRF-1 protein was predominantly cytoplasmic during this
treatment. Although a second dose of ATRA or Am580 (a related retinoid selective 
for retinoic acid receptor-alpha [RARalpha]), given 16 hrs after the first dose, 
restimulated IRF-1 mRNA and protein levels to a similar level to that obtained by
the first dose, IRF-1 was predominantly concentrated in the nucleus after
restimulation. ATRA and Am580 also increased nuclear RARalpha, whereas retinoid X
receptor-alpha (RXRalpha)--a dimerization partner for RARalpha, was localized to 
the nucleus upon second exposure to ATRA. However, ATRA and Am580 did not
regulate the expression or activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1 (STAT-1), a transcription factor capable of inducing the
expression of IRF-1, indicating an STAT-1-independent mechanism of regulation by 
ATRA and Am580. The increase in nuclear IRF-1 after retinoid restimulation was
accompanied by enhanced binding to an IRF-E DNA response element, and elevated
expression of an IRF-1 target gene, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-2. The dual
effect of retinoids in increasing IRF-1 mRNA and protein and in augmenting the
nuclear localization of IRF-1 protein may be essential for maximizing the tumor
suppressor activity and the immunosurveillance functions of IRF-1 in breast
epithelial cells.

NFkappaB negatively regulates interferon-induced gene expression and
anti-influenza activity.

Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.

Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines that selectively regulate gene
expression through several signaling pathways including nuclear factor
kappaB(NFkappaB). To investigate the specific role of NFkappaB in IFN signaling, 
we performed gene expression profiling after IFN treatment of embryonic
fibroblasts derived from normal mice or mice with targeted deletion of NFkappaB
p50 and p65 genes. Interestingly, several antiviral and immunomodulatory genes
were induced higher by IFN in NFkappaB knock-out cells. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that NFkappaB was basally bound to
the promoters of these genes, while IFN treatment resulted in the recruitment of 
STAT1 and STAT2 to these promoters. However, in NFkappaB knock-out cells IFN
induced STAT binding as well as the binding of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1)
to the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters. IRF1 binding closely correlated with 
enhanced gene induction. Moreover, NFkappaB suppressed both antiviral and
immunomodulatory actions of IFN against influenza virus. Our results identify a
novel negative regulatory role of NFkappaB in IFN-induced gene expression and
biological activities and suggest that modulating NFkappaB activity may provide a
new avenue for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN.

Identification and regulatory analysis of rainbow trout tapasin and
tapasin-related genes.

Author information:

Maryland, USA.

Tapasin (TAPBP) is a key member of MHC class Ia antigen-loading complexes,
bridging the class Ia molecule to the transporter associated with antigen
presentation (TAP). As part of an ongoing study of MHC genomics in rainbow trout,
we have identified two rainbow trout TAPBP genes (Onmy-TAPBP.a and .b) and a
similar but distinct TAPBP-related gene (Onmy-TAPBP-R) that had previously only
been described in mammals. Physical and genetic mapping indicate that
Onmy-TAPBP.a is on chromosome 18 in the MHC class Ia region and that Onmy-TAPBP.b
resides on chromosome 14 in the MHC class Ib region. There are also at least two 
copies of TAPBP-R, Onmy-TAPBP-R.a and Onmy-TAPBP-R.b, located on chromosomes 2
and 3, respectively. Due to the central role of TAPBP expression during acute
viral infection, we have characterized the transcriptional profile and regulatory
regions for both Onmy-TAPBP and Onmy-TAPBP-R. Transcription of both genes
increased during acute infection with infectious hematapoeitic necrosis virus
(IHNV) in a fashion indicative of interferon-mediated regulation.
Promoter-reporter assays in STE-137 cells demonstrate that the trout TAPBP and
TAPBP-R promoters respond to interferon regulatory factors, Onmy-IRF1 and
Onmy-IRF2. Overall, TAPBP is expressed at higher levels than TAPBP-R in naïve
tissues and TAPBP transcription is more responsive to viral infection and IRF1
and 2 binding.

The influence of environmental pH on the production of tumoricidal free radical
nitric oxide (NO) was investigated in mouse fibrosarcoma L929 and rat glioma C6
cell lines. A combination of IFN-gamma and IL-1 induced a significant NO release 
and subsequent reduction of cell viability in tumor cell lines. Acidification of 
cell culture medium reduced tumor cell NO production in a pH-dependent manner.
While the inhibitory effect of acidosis on NO production in C6 cells was
associated with a further decrease in cell viability, it completely rescued L929 
cells from NO-dependent apoptotic and necrotic death. Acidic pH diminished
IFN-gamma+ IL-1-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA and
protein, and abolished the activation of iNOS transcription factor IRF-1 in L929 
cells. Moreover, extracellular acidosis significantly impaired cytokine-induced
phosphorylation of MAP kinase p44/42 (ERK1/2) and subsequent expression of
transcription factor c-Fos in L929 cells. Finally, mild acidosis (pH 6.8)
augmented, while severe acidosis (pH 6.0) reduced, IFN-gamma-induced iNOS
activation/NO release and NO-dependent anticancer activity of rat and mouse
macrophages. Taken together, our findings indicate that modulation of macrophage 
and tumor cell iNOS by an acidic microenvironment might influence the progression
of NO-sensitive solid tumors.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), human X-box binding protein-1 (hXBP-1),
nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NFkappaB p65) and nucleophosmin (NPM) have been
implicated in a signaling network of endocrine responsiveness. Expression of
these proteins was measured by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of 54
breast tumors. Correlations between each protein and established prognostic
markers were assessed by Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient and
partial correlation coefficient analyses. Moderate/strong staining is seen for
hXBP-1 (79% of tumors) and NFkappaB p65 (57%). NPM exhibits nuclear staining
(95%); IRF-1 exhibits both cytosolic (IRF-1c; 90%) and nuclear staining (IRF-1n; 
51%). IRF-1c is associated with age (p=0.034); IRF-1n and PgR expression are
correlated (p=0.014). NFkappaB p65 shows a borderline association with S phase
(p=0.062). Coexpression of IRF-1c and hXBP1 (p=0.001), IRF-1c and NFkappaB
(p=0.002), and hXBP-1 and NFkappaB (p=0.018) is observed. An inverse correlation 
exists between IRF-1n and NFkappaB (p=0.034). All four proteins are detected in
breast tumors and their expression patterns support their role(s) in a key
signaling network.

BACKGROUND: The persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs is the principal barrier
preventing the eradication of HIV-1 infection in patients by current
antiretroviral therapy. It is thus crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms
involved in the establishment, maintenance and reactivation of HIV-1 latency.
Since chromatin remodeling has been implicated in the transcriptional
reactivation of the HIV-1 promoter, we assessed the role of the histone
deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) on two HIV-1 latently infected cell
lines (U1 and ACH-2) gene expression.
RESULTS: Analysis of microarrays data led us to select two candidate genes: NCoA3
(Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3), a nuclear receptor coactivator and IRF8
(Interferon Regulatory Factor 8), an interferon regulatory factor. NCoA3 gene
expression is upregulated following NaB treatment of latently infected cells
whereas IRF8 gene expression is strongly downregulated in the promonocytic cell
line following NaB treatment. Their differential expressions were confirmed at
the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, NCoA3 gene expression was
also upregulated after treatment of U1 and ACH-2 cells with phorbol myristyl
acetate (PMA) but not trichostatin A (TSA) and after treatment with NaB of two
others HIV-1 latently infected cell lines (OM10.1 and J1.1). IRF8 gene is only
expressed in U1 cells and was also downregulated after treatment with PMA or TSA.
Functional analyses confirmed that NCoA3 synergizes with Tat to enhance HIV-1
promoter transcription and that IRF8 represses the IRF1-mediated activation
through the HIV-1 promoter Interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE).
CONCLUSION: These results led us to postulate that NCoA3 could be involved in the
transcriptional reactivation of the HIV-1 promoter from latency and that IRF8 may
contribute to the maintenance of the latent state in the promonocytic cell line. 
Implication of these factors in the maintenance or reactivation of the viral
latency may provide potential new targets to control HIV-1 replication in latent 
viral reservoirs.

PROBLEM: Brucellosis causes abortion in domestic animals and Malta fever in
humans. Comparison of Brucella species genomes may reveal potential virulence
mechanisms. Engineering bioluminescent Brucella would permit monitoring bacterial
dissemination.
METHOD OF STUDY: Microarray of the B. melitensis genome allowed comparison of
gene content from six Brucella species. Bioluminescent B. melitensis strains were
developed using transposon mutagenesis permitting the study of pathogenic
Brucella in mice. Monitoring bacterial dissemination as well as organ
localization permits evaluating the role of genes and genomic islands in mutant
bacteria.
RESULTS: Comparative genomic analysis revealed 217 ORFs altered in five Brucella 
species and were often found in islands. Bioluminescent bacteria disseminated
from the injection site to liver, spleen, inguinal lymph nodes, testes and
submanibular region.
CONCLUSIONS: Genomic islands contribute to Brucella pathogenicity. Biophotonic
imaging suggests that Brucella dissemination in mice parallels acute and chronic 
infections of humans.

In vitro human monocyte differentiation to macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs)
is driven by GM-CSF or GM-CSF and IL-4, respectively. IFN regulatory factors
(IRFs), especially IRF1 and IRF8, are known to play essential roles in the
development and functions of macrophages and DCs. In the present study, we
performed cDNA microarray and Northern blot analyses to characterize changes in
gene expression of selected genes during cytokine-stimulated differentiation of
human monocytes to macrophages or DCs. The results show that the expression of
IRF4 mRNA, but not of other IRFs, was specifically up-regulated during DC
differentiation. No differences in IRF4 promoter histone acetylation could be
found between macrophages and DCs, suggesting that the gene locus was accessible 
for transcription in both cell types. Computer analysis of the human IRF4
promoter revealed several putative STAT and NF-kappaB binding sites, as well as
an IRF/Ets binding site. These sites were found to be functional in transcription
factor-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Interestingly,
Stat4 and NF-kappaB p50 and p65 mRNAs were expressed at higher levels in DCs as
compared with macrophages, and enhanced binding of these factors to their
respective IRF4 promoter elements was found in DCs. IRF4, together with PU.1, was
also found to bind to the IRF/Ets response element in the IRF4 promoter,
suggesting that IRF4 protein provides a positive feedback signal for its own gene
expression in DCs. Our results suggest that IRF4 is likely to play an important
role in myeloid DC differentiation and gene regulatory functions.

Lung epithelial cells are the primary cellular targets for respiratory virus
pathogens such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Here, we have analyzed
influenza A, influenza B and Sendai virus-induced chemokine response in human
A549 lung epithelial cells. Influenza virus infection resulted in low CCL2/MCP-1,
CCL5/RANTES, CXCL8/IL-8 and CXCL10/IP-10 production at late times of infection.
However, when cells were pretreated with TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha,
influenza-A-virus-induced chemokine production was greatly enhanced. Cytokine
pretreatment resulted in enhanced expression of RIG-I, IKKepsilon, interferon
regulatory factor (IRF)1, IRF7 and p50 proteins. Most importantly,
influenza-A-virus-induced DNA binding of IRF1, IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kappaB onto
CXCL10 ISRE and NF-kappaB elements, respectively, was markedly enhanced in
cytokine-pretreated cells. Our results suggest that IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha have 
a significant role in priming epithelial cells for higher cytokine and chemokine 
production in influenza A virus infection.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 expression in breast cancer
tissue microarrays.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent antitumor
effects, both in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor activity of IFN-gamma is
mediated in part through IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and may be blocked by
IRF-2. To test our hypothesis that some tumors escape the antitumor effects of
IFN-gamma by cellular changes reflected in IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression, we
examined IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression in tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 187
specimens of clinically defined invasive breast carcinoma. TMAs (Cooperative
Breast Cancer Tissue Resource [CBCTR], National Cancer Institute [NCI]) were
stained and then scored by three evaluators blinded to the patients' clinical
status. After final scoring, the CBCTR provided the available clinical data for
each patient. Whether sorted by carcinoma type or for all data together,
statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation between IRF-1 and 
IRF-2 expression (p = 0.01) and a negative correlation between IRF-1 expression
and tumor grade (p = 0.005). IRF-1 expression is consistent with its role as a
tumor suppressor; high-grade breast carcinomas were less likely to maintain
expression of IRF-1, a finding consistent with a role for IRF-1 as a tumor
suppressor. Further, tumors maintained expression of IRF-2 if there was
coincident expression of IRF-1. These data support a model in which alterations
of the expression of intracellular effectors of IFN-gamma signaling may diminish 
the immune-mediated tumor control mechanisms of IFN-gamma.

Proinflammatory cytokines have been linked to depression of myocardial
contractility in vivo in patients with acute septic shock and in vitro models
employing isolated myocytes exposed to serum from such patients. The key pathways
involved in mediating this septic organ dysfunction (cell adhesion molecule
expression, inducible nitric-oxide synthase induction, and apoptosis) are known
to be regulated by transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB. Utilizing a 
model that mimics human disease, we have demonstrated activation of the
transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB in human fetal myocytes exposed 
to human septic serum. Both reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
demonstrated a 5-19-fold increase in activation of transcription factors STAT1,
IRF1, and NF-kappaB in response to incubation with human septic serum. The
addition of human septic serum to human fetal myocytes induced apoptosis in human
fetal myocytes and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH
-terminal kinase and caspase 1 as measured by Western blot. These data suggest
that transcription factor activation and early myocyte apoptosis play a
mechanistic role in septic myocardial depression and sepsis-induced organ
dysfunction.

TRAIL (Apo2 ligand) described as a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the
TNF superfamily can induce apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types. In
the present study, a putative cDNA sequence encoding the 299 amino acids of TRAIL
(GC-TRAIL) and its genomic organization were identified in grass carp
Ctenopharyngodon idella. The predicted GC-TRAIL sequence showed 44 and 41%
identities to chicken and human TRAILs, respectively. In a domain search, a tumor
necrosis factor homology domain (THD) was identified in the C-terminal portion of
TRAILs. The GC-TRAIL gene consists of five exons, with four intervening introns, 
spaced over approximately 4 kb of genomic sequence. Analysis of GC-TRAIL promoter
region revealed the presence of a number of putative transcription factor binding
sites, such as Sp1, NF-kappaB, AP-1, GATA, NFAT, HNF, STAT, P53 and IRF1
sequences which are important for the expression of other TNF family members.
Phylogenetic analysis placed GC-TRAIL and the putative zebrafish (Danio rerio)
TRAIL obtained from searching the zebrafish database into one separate cluster
near mammalian TRAIL genes, but apart from the reported zebrafish TRAIL-like
protein, indicating that the GC-TRAIL is an authentic fish TRAIL. Expression
analysis revealed that GC-TRAIL is expressed in many tissues, such as in gills,
liver, trunk kidney, head kidney, intestine and spleen.

Graves' disease (GD) was believed to be a polygenic disease. Several chromosomal 
regions were linked to GD, and the 5q31 chromosome regions containing several
interleukin genes cluster were worth observing. In this study, IL4, IL13, IRF1
and UGRP1 genes were sequenced, and 5, 3, 7 and 7 polymorphisms respectively were
discovered. Then an extended association study for the attracting polymorphisms
was performed with 146 sporadic Graves' patients, 142 unrelated controls and the 
54 multiplex Graves' families. However, the genotype and allele frequency
distribution of these polymorphisms had similar distribution between the Graves' 
patients and unrelated controls, and transmission disequilibrium tests indicated 
that none of them showed dominant transmission from heterozygous parents to the
affected offsprings. Comparison of the clinical variables of the Graves' patients
indicated that the onset ages of the patients carrying TT at IRF1 6477 T/G locus 
were younger than those having variant allele (TG, GG); the difference was of
statistical significance (P=0.005, Pc=0.020). Our association study revealed
that, IL4, IL13, IRF1 and UGRP1 genes in chromosomal 5q31 regions might not
confer susceptibility to Chinese GD. But those individuals who were TT homozygous
at IRF1 6477 T/G locus seemed to be attacked by GD much earlier than others.

IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 8 is a transcription factor that directs macrophage
differentiation. By fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we visualized the
movement of IRF8-GFP in differentiating macrophages. Recovery data fitted to
mathematical models revealed two binding states for IRF8. The majority of IRF8
was highly mobile and transiently interacted with chromatin, whereas a small
fraction of IRF8 bound to chromatin more stably. IRF8 mutants that did not
stimulate macrophage differentiation showed a faster recovery, revealing little
interaction with chromatin. A macrophage activation signal by IFN-gamma/LPS led
to a global slowdown of IRF8 movement, leading to increased chromatin binding. In
fibroblasts where IRF8 has no known function, WT IRF8 moved as fast as the
mutants, indicating that IRF8 does not interact with chromatin in these cells.
However, upon introduction of IRF8 binding partners, PU.1 and/or IRF1, the
mobility of IRF8 was markedly reduced, producing a more stably bound component.
Together, IRF8-chromatin interaction is dynamic in live macrophages and
influenced by partner proteins and immunological stimuli.

IFN regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) is a transcription factor that is involved in the
development and the functions of lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells.
Despite their critical roles in immune system regulation, the target genes
controlled by IRF-4 are poorly understood. In this study, we determined the
consensus DNA-binding sequences preferred for IRF-4 by in vitro binding site
selections. IRF-4 preferentially bound to the sequences containing tandem repeats
of 5'-GAAA-3', flanked by CpC, in most cases. IRF-4 repressed the promoter
bearing tandem copies of the selected binding sequence, while IRF-1 activated the
same constructs. Interestingly, the IRF-1-dependent transactivation is inhibited 
in the presence of IRF-4, but not IRF-2. A series of deletion mutants of IRF-4
revealed that its DNA-binding domain was necessary and sufficient to antagonize
the IRF-1-dependent transactivation. This dominant negative action of IRF-4 over 
IRF-1 was also observed in a natural promoter context, such as the TRAIL gene.
These results indicate that IRF-4 acts as a natural antagonist against IRF-1 in
immune cells.

Despite progress in mouse models of brucellosis, much remains unknown regarding
Brucella dissemination and tissue localization. Here, we report the dynamics of
Brucella infection in individual mice using bioluminescent Brucella melitensis.
Bioluminescent imaging of infected interferon regulatory factor-1 knockout
(IRF-1(-/-)) mice identified acute infection in many tissues. Brucella was found 
to replicate in the salivary glands of IRF-1(-/-) and wild-type C57BL/6 mice
suggesting a previously unknown tissue preference. Establishing a niche in this
region may have relevance in humans where infection can result from ingestion of 
few bacteria. Sublethal infection of IRF-1(-/-) mice resulted in chronic Brucella
localization in tail joints, an infection parallel to osteoarticular brucellosis 
in humans. Importantly, bioluminescent imaging rapidly identified attenuated
EZ::TN/lux mutants in infected mice and revealed differences in dissemination,
thereby defining the contribution of Brucella genes to virulence and tissue
localization. Surprisingly, a virB mutant, though defective in persistence,
disseminated similarly to virulent Brucella, suggesting bacterial spread is
independent of VirB proteins that are important for intracellular survival.
Together, our results reveal kinetics of acute and chronic Brucella infection in 
individual mice that parallels human infection as well as readily identified
attenuated bacteria. Our approach facilitates identifying virulence determinants 
that may control tissue specific replication and may help develop therapeutics to
overcome Brucella-induced chronic debilitating conditions.

This study investigated memory responses in immune mice spleen cells to
brucellosis by gene expression utilizing cDNA micro arrays. Out of a total of
1176 cDNA's 21 genes were differentially regulated in three independent
experiments, and generally supported a Th1 type immune response. 10 genes were
validated by real time PCR, and 3 genes (CD 86, CD 40 L and CD 132) were also
analyzed by Flow Cytometry for surface protein expression. We extended these
findings by studying the expression of five selected genes (IRF 1, SOCS 1, IL 2
R, IRF 7, and CXCR 4) in two independent groups of Brucella immunized mice. In
this study we show the potential application of utilizing gene arrays to identify
and establish new correlates of protection against a cell mediated immune

16-kDa prolactin down-regulates inducible nitric oxide synthase expression

Angiogenesis plays a key role in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. Several 
antiangiogenic factors have been shown to inhibit tumor growth in animal models. 
Understanding their mechanism of action would allow for better therapeutic
application. 16-kDa prolactin (PRL), a NH2-terminal natural breakdown fragment of
the intact 23-kDa PRL, exerts potent antiangiogenic and antitumor activities. The
signaling mechanism involved in 16-kDa PRL action in endothelial cells remains
unclear. One of the actions of 16-kDa PRL is to attenuate the production of
nitric oxide (NO) through the inhibition of inducible NO synthase (iNOS)
expression in endothelial cells. To delineate the signaling mechanism from 16-kDa
PRL, we examined the effect of 16-kDa PRL on interleukin IL-1beta-inducible iNOS 
expression, which is regulated by two parallel pathways, one involving IFN
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and the other nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Our 
studies showed that 16-kDa PRL specifically blocked IRF-1 but not NF-kappaB
signaling to the iNOS promoter. We found that IL-1beta regulated IRF-1 gene
expression through stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
which mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) serine 
phosphorylation and Stat1 nuclear translocation to activate the IRF-1 promoter.
16-kDa PRL effectively inhibited IL-1beta-inducible p38 MAPK phosphorylation,
resulting in blocking Stat1 serine phosphorylation, its subsequent nuclear
translocation and activation of the Stat1 target gene IRF-1. Thus, 16-kDa PRL
inhibits the p38 MAPK/Stat1/IRF-1 pathway to attenuate iNOS/NO production in
endothelial cells.

Identification of mechanisms underlying transporter associated with antigen

Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.

Expression of transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is often lost 
in metastatic carcinomas, resulting in defective antigen processing and
presentation and escape of the cancer cells from immune surveillance. In this
study, the nature of TAP deficiencies in tumors was investigated. By chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to
the TAP-1 gene was impaired in TAP-deficient cells derived from murine melanoma, 
prostate, and lung carcinomas, compared with TAP-expressing fibroblasts and
lymphoma cells. This suggested that the deficiency in TAP-1 expression resulted, 
at least partially, from a relatively low level of transcription of the TAP-1
gene. Furthermore, levels of TAP-1 promoter activity, as assessed by stable
transfections with a reporter construct containing the TAP-1 promoter, were
relatively low in TAP-deficient cells. To examine genetic heritability of
regulators of TAP-1 promoter activity, TAP- and MHC class I-deficient cells of
H-2b origin were fused with wild-type fibroblasts of H-2k origin. Fusion with
TAP-expressing cells complemented the low levels of TAP-1 promoter activity in
TAP-deficient cells. However, these fused cells exhibited lower levels of TAP-1
mRNA and H-2k than unfused fibroblasts. Further analysis showed that TAP-1 mRNA
stability was lower in fused carcinoma fibroblasts than in unfused fibroblasts.
Based on these results, we propose that TAP deficiency in many carcinomas is
caused by a decrease in activity/expression of trans-acting factors regulating
TAP-1 promoter activity, as well as a decrease in TAP-1 mRNA stability. These
results have significant implications for understanding immune evasion mechanisms
in tumors.

Mechanisms of deregulation of IFN regulatory factor-1 in ras-transformed
fibroblasts.

Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) deregulation in ras-transformed
mouse fibroblasts (RS485) was studied. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 did not alter the constitutive IRF-1 protein levels in RS485 but
significantly increased them in nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells at 4 h after serum
stimulation of synchronized cultures. Because IRF-1 protein levels in NIH 3T3 are
minimal at 4 h after serum starvation, the cyclic expression of IRF-1 in NIH 3T3 
appears to be partially due to proteasome activity; however, proteasome activity 
in RS485 did not appear to be defective. In NIH 3T3 and RS485 cells treated with 
cycloheximide, there were similar rapid drops in IRF-1 protein levels, and the
addition of MG132 along with cycloheximide prevented protein loss in both cell
lines. Northern blot analyses of synchronized cultures showed that the IRF-1
message closely mirrored the protein expression pattern in both NIH 3T3 and RS485
cells. In synchronized cells treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin
D, IRF-1 mRNA half-life was only marginally longer in ras-transformed fibroblasts
than in the nontransformed cells, and this difference would contribute minimally 
to protein overexpression. These findings indicate that IRF-1 deregulation in
RS485 cells occurs primarily at the transcriptional level.

Expression and DNA binding activity of the recombinant interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1) of mouse.

University, New Delhi 110067, India.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a positive transcription factor for
genes involved in immune response, cell growth regulation and apoptosis in
mammalian cells. Many agents like virus, interferon (IFN), double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA), proinflammatory cytokines, prolactin etc. induce IRF-1 at
transcriptional level. IRF-1 transcriptionally activates many IRF-1-regulated
genes during normal physiological and pathological conditions. We have expressed 
recombinant mouse IRF-1 (329 amino acids) as a
GST(glutathione-S-transferase)-IRF-1 fusion protein from a 1029 bp IRF-1 cDNA in 
pGEX-2TK expression vector in Escherichia coli XL-1 blue cells. Recombinant
GST-IRF-1 was highly expressed as a approximately 66 kDa soluble protein by
IPTG-induction, and was biologically active in terms of its DNA binding activity 
with a 24 bp specific oligonucleotide, i.e. 32P(GAAAGT)4 but not with a similar
but nonspecific oligonucleotide i.e. 32P(GAAA)6. GST-alone expressed from the
vector did not bind 32P(GAAAGT)4. We observed multiple (1-4) GST-IRF-1-(GAAAGT)4 
protein-DNA complexes which were competed out by 25x- to 100x-fold molar excess
of (GAAAGT)4 showing that the complexes 1-4 were specific for IRF-1. Such GAAANN 
(N = any nucleotide) hexanucleotides occur in the promoters of many virus- and
interferon-inducible mammalian genes. Multimeric GAAAGT/C sequences are inducible
by virus, IFN, dsRNA and IRF-1. Specificity of DNA binding by IRF-1 lies in the
5th and 6th nucleotides in the GAAAGT sequence. Multiple IRF-1-DNA complexes
should stimulate transcription by IRF-1.

Despite a key role in the regulation of interferon (IFN) gene expression and in
mediating many downstream actions of the IFNs, the regulation of IFN regulatory
factor (IRF) gene expression in the normal and pathological central nervous
system and, indeed, other tissues, is poorly defined. We sought to examine the
expression and regulation of the IRF genes in a number of different murine models
for immune- or virally induced central nervous system disease. Here, we describe 
the development of a multiprobe RNase protection assay that permits the
simultaneous detection and quantification of IRF ribonucleic acid transcripts for
multiple family members in murine cells and tissues.

Differential involvement of BB loops of toll-IL-1 resistance (TIR)

TLRs sense pathogens and transmit intracellular signals via the use of specific
adapter proteins. We designed a set of "blocking peptides" (BPs) comprised of the
14 aa that correspond to the sequences of the BB loops of the four known
Toll-IL-1 resistance (TIR) domain-containing adapter proteins (i.e., MyD88, TIR
domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-beta (TRIF), TRIF-related adapter molecule
(TRAM), and TIR-domain containing adapter protein (TIRAP)) linked to the
cell-penetrating segment of the antennapedia homeodomain. LPS (TLR4)-mediated
gene expression, as well as MAPK and transcription factor activation associated
with both MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, were disrupted by 
all four BPs (TRAM approximately MyD88 > TRIF > TIRAP), but not by a control
peptide. In contrast, none of the BPs inhibited TLR2-mediated activation of
MAPKs. Only the MyD88 BP significantly blocked Pam3Cys-induced IL-1beta mRNA;
however, the inhibitory effect was much less than observed for LPS. Our data
suggest that the interactions required for a fully functional TLR4 signaling
"platform" are disrupted by these BPs, and that the adapter BB loops may serve
distinct roles in TLR4 and TLR2 signalosome assembly.

IgA Abs help to maintain homeostasis at mucosal surfaces by promoting defense
mechanisms that protect against pathogens while suppressing inflammatory
responses to commensal organisms and food Ags. The polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR)
mediates transport of IgA across mucosal epithelial cells. We hypothesized that
signaling through TLRs may up-regulate pIgR expression by intestinal epithelial
cells and thus enhance IgA-mediated homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we
treated the HT29 human intestinal epithelial cell line with dsRNA, a ligand for
TLR3, or LPS, a ligand for TLR4. Both dsRNA and LPS up-regulated levels of pIgR
mRNA and cell surface pIgR protein. By contrast, dsRNA but not LPS up-regulated
expression of TLR3 and TLR4 mRNA. However, cell surface expression of both TLR3
and TLR4 was enhanced by treatment of HT29 cells with their respective ligands.
Transfection of HT29 cells with wild-type and mutated promoter/enhancer plasmids 
suggested that TLR3 and TLR4 signal primarily through NF-kappaB to enhance
transcription of pIgR mRNA. TLR3 signaling resulted in a more pronounced
inflammatory response than did TLR4, as evidenced by up-regulation of the
transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1, chemokines IL-8 and RANTES, and the
proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Signaling through LPS/TLR4 appears to up-regulate
pIgR expression while minimizing proinflammatory responses, a mechanism that
could promote IgA-mediated homeostasis in the presence of commensal Gram-negative
bacteria.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor involved in
interferon-mediated immune reaction, CD8+ T cell differentiation and development 
of T helper 1 immune reaction. We have recently demonstrated that IRF-1 is
pivotal in iodine-induced lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) in non-obese diabetic
(NOD) mice. However, it remains unclear whether the mechanism involved in
spontaneous LT is identical with iodine-induced LT in NOD mice. To determine the 
role of IRF-1 in spontaneous LT, we used IRF-1 deficient NOD mice as well as
IRF-1 +/+ and +/- mice which were free from treatments for LT induction, and LT
was evaluated at 24 weeks of age. IRF-1 +/+, +/- and -/- mice developed LT
spontaneously, and there were no differences among the 3 IRF-1 genotypes in the
incidence and severity of LT. Whereas both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were present in 
the diseased thyroid of IRF-1 +/+ mice, CD8+ T cells were absent in the thyroid
of IRF-1 -/- mice. MHC class II antigen expression was induced in the inflamed
thyroid of IRF-1 -/- mice comparable to IRF-1 +/+ mice. There was a selective
reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen of IRF-1 -/- mice. IFNgamma
production, but not IL-10, by concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes was
significantly reduced in IRF-1 deficient mice. These results suggest that IRF-1
plays only a minor role in spontaneous LT in NOD mice and, furthermore, the
mechanism involved in spontaneous LT is different from that of iodine-induced LT 
in NOD mice.

RET/PTC rearrangements represent key genetic events involved in papillary thyroid
carcinoma (PTC) initiation. The aim of the present study was to identify the
early changes in gene expression induced by RET/PTC in thyroid cells. For this
purpose, microarray analysis was conducted on PCCL3 cells conditionally
expressing the RET/PTC3 oncogene. Gene expression profiling 48 h after activation
of RET/PTC3 identified a statistically significant modification of expression of 
270 genes. Quantitative PCR confirmation of 20 of these demonstrated 90% accuracy
of the microarray. Functional clustering of genes with greater than or less than 
1.75-fold expression change (86 genes) revealed RET/PTC3-induced regulation of
genes with key functions in apoptosis (Ripk3, Tdga), cell-cell signaling (Cdh6,
Fn1), cell cycle (Il24), immune and inflammation response (Cxcl10, Scya2, Il6,
Gbp2, Oas1, Tap1, RT1Aw2, C2ta, Irf1, Lmp2, Psme2, Prkr), metabolism (Aldob,
Ptges, Nd2, Gss, Gstt1), signal transduction (Socs3, Nf1, Jak2, Cpg21, Dusp6,
Socs1, Stat1, Stat3, Cish) and transcription (Nr4a1, Junb, Hfh1, Runx1, Foxe1).
Genes coding for proteins involved in the immune response and in intracellular
signal transduction pathways activated by cytokines and chemokines were strongly 
represented, indicating a critical role of RET/PTC3 in the early modulation of
the immune response.

IRF-1 mediates upregulation of LMP7 by IFN-gamma and concerted expression of
immunosubunits of the proteasome.

An immunoproteasome subunit low molecular weight protein 7 (LMP7) plays critical 
roles in major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing; however,
the mechanism for its expression has remained unclear. We demonstrate that
interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) has a pivotal role in
IFN-gamma-dependent LMP7 expression, as was shown for the other two
immunosubunits. A tetracycline-inducible system for IRF-1 revealed its function
in the LMP7 expression, and a genomic region functionally interacting with IRF-1 
was also determined. Furthermore, the role of IRF-1 in IFN-gamma-inducible LMP7
transcription was confirmed by employing small interfering RNA experiments and
IRF-1-/- mice. These results suggest that IRF-1 acts as a master regulator for
the concerted expression of immunoproteasome components.

Functional characterization of core promoter elements: DPE-specific transcription
requires the protein kinase CK2 and the PC4 coactivator.

Downstream core promoter elements are an expanding class of regulatory sequences 
that add considerable diversity to the promoter architecture of RNA polymerase
II-transcribed genes. We set out to determine the factors necessary for
downstream promoter element (DPE)-dependent transcription and find that, against 
expectations, TFIID and the GTFs are not sufficient. Instead, the protein kinase 
CK2 and the coactivator PC4 establish DPE-specific transcription in an in vitro
transcription system containing TFIID, Mediator, and the GTFs. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analyses using the DPE-dependent IRF-1 and TAF7 promoters
demonstrated that CK2, and PC4 are present on these promoters in vivo. In
contrast, neither PC4 nor CK2 were detected on the TAF1-dependent cyclin D
promoter, which contains a DCE type of downstream element. Our findings also
demonstrate that CK2 activity alters TFIID-dependent recognition of DCE
sequences. These data establish that CK2 acts as a switch, converting the
transcriptional machinery from functioning on one type of downstream element to
another.

Interferon alpha activates NF-kappaB in JAK1-deficient cells through a
TYK2-dependent pathway.

Author information:

Health Science Center and the University of Tennessee Cancer Institute, Memphis, 
Tennessee 38163, USA.

In addition to activating members of the STAT transcription factor family,
interferon alpha/beta (IFNalpha/beta) activates the NF-kappaB transcription
factor. To determine the role of the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway in 
NF-kappaB activation by IFN, we examined NF-kappaB activation in JAK1-deficient
mutant human fibrosarcoma cells. In wild-type fibrosarcoma cells (2fTGH), IFN
activates STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3, as well as NF-kappaB complexes comprised of
p50 and p65. In contrast, in JAK1-deficient cells, IFN induces NF-kappaB
activation and NF-kappaB dependent gene transcription but does not activate these
STAT proteins and has no effect on STAT-dependent gene transcription. Expression 
of a catalytically inactive TYK2 tyrosine kinase in JAK1-deficient cells, as well
as in the highly IFN-sensitive Daudi lymphoblastoid cell line, abrogates
NF-kappaB activation by IFN. Moreover, IFN does not promote NF-kappaB activation 
in TYK2-deficient mutant fibrosarcoma cells. Our results demonstrate a dichotomy 
between the classical JAK-STAT pathway and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In
the IFN signaling pathway leading to STAT activation, both JAK1 and TYK2 are
essential, whereas NF-kappaB activation requires only TYK2.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) exhibits tumor suppressor activities in
breast cancer associated with caspase activation and induction of apoptosis.

We have directly assessed the ability of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
to act as a tumor suppressor gene in human breast cancer cells and explored
whether this suppressor function is mechanistically conferred by affecting cell
cycle transition, apoptosis and/or caspase activation. We have used a dual
approach, measuring whether overexpression of wild-type IRF-1 or a dominant
negative IRF-1 (dnIRF-1) produce opposing effects on breast cancer cell
proliferation in vitro or tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. Mechanistic
studies determined the effects of blocking endogenous IRF-1 expression on cell
cycle transition by flow cytometry, on apoptosis by Annexin V staining, and on
caspase activation by fluorescent substrate cleavage. IRF-1 mRNA (P < or = 0.001)
and protein (P < or = 0.001) are highly expressed in non-tumorigenic, normal,
mammary epithelial cells, with intermediate expression in tumorigenic, but
non-metastatic, cells and very low expression in metastatic cell lines. In MCF-7 
cells transfected with a wild-type IRF-1 (MCF-7/IRF-1), IRF-1 mRNA expression
inversely correlates with the rate of cell proliferation (r = -0.91; P = 0.002). 
Conversely, expression of dnIRF-1 in both MCF-7 (MCF-7/dnIRF-1; p53 wild-type)
and T47D cells (T47D/dnIRF-1; p53 mutant) increases cell proliferation (P < or = 
0.001). In athymic nude mice, the incidence of MCF-7/IRF-1 xenografts is reduced 
(P = 0.045), whereas MCF-7/dnIRF-1 xenografts exhibit a significantly higher
tumor incidence (P < or = 0.001). Effects of IRF-1/dnIRF-1 are mediated through
changes in the rates of apoptosis and not through cell cycle regulation.
MCF-7/dnIRF-1 cells exhibit a 50% decrease in basal apoptosis (P = 0.007) and a
significant reduction in caspase 8 activity (P = 0.03); similar effects occur in 
T47D/dnIRF-1 cells, where the effects on apoptosis appear to be mediated through 
inhibition of caspases 3/7 (P < 0.001) and caspase 8 (P = 0.03). These data
establish a functional role for IRF-1 in the growth suppression of breast cancer 
cells and strongly implicate IRF-1 as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer
that acts, independent of p53, to control apoptosis.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 is an essential and direct transcriptional
activator for interferon {gamma}-induced RANTES/CCl5 expression in macrophages.

Liu J(1), Guan X, Ma X.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Medical College of Cornell
University, New York, New York 10021, USA.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is an important transcription factor in
interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-mediated signaling in the development and function of
NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. RANTES (regulated on activation normal T
cell expressed and secreted; CCL5) is a member of the CC chemokine family of
proteins, which is strongly chemoattractant for several important immune cell
types in host defense against infectious agents and cancer. However, the role of 
IFNgamma and IRF-1 in the regulation of RANTES gene expression and their
operative mechanisms in macrophages have not been established. We report here
that RANTES expression in IRF-1-null mice, primarily in macrophages, in response 
to carcinogenic stimulation in vivo and in vitro and to IFNgamma but not to
lipopolysaccharide in vitro, was markedly decreased. As a result, RANTES-mediated
chemoattraction of CCR5(+) target cells was also severely impaired.
Adenovirus-mediated gene transduction of IRF-1 in primary macrophages resulted in
enhanced RANTES expression. The IFNgamma and IRF1 response element was localized 
to a TTTTC motif at -147 to -143 of the mouse RANTES promoter, to which
endogenous or recombinant IRF-1 can physically bind in vitro and in vivo. This
study uncovers a novel IFNgamma-induced pathway in RANTES expression mediated by 
IRF-1 in macrophages and elucidates an important host defense mechanism against
neoplastic transformation.

Center and College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229,

The complement system and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are two central arms of 
innate immunity that are critical to host defense as well as the development of
adaptive immunity. Most pathogens activate both complement and TLRs, suggesting
the potential for crosstalk between the two systems. We show here that the
complement-derived C5a anaphylatoxin negatively regulates TLR4- and CD40-induced 
synthesis of IL-12 family cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27) from inflammatory
macrophages (M phi s) by extracellular signal-regulated kinase- and
phosphoinositide 3 kinase-dependent pathways. This decreased cytokine response
translates into a decreased T helper type 1 (Th1) response in vitro and in vivo. 
Accordingly, we found enhanced Th1 immunity in C5a receptor-deficient mice,
something that conferred protection from Leishmania major infection. Our findings
identify the negative impact of C5a on IL-12 family cytokines as an important
mechanism for regulating Th1 polarization in response to innate and adaptive
immune network activation.

Mycobacteria inhibition of IFN-gamma induced HLA-DR gene expression by
up-regulating histone deacetylation at the promoter region in human THP-1
monocytic cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Virology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210,
USA.

Infection of macrophages with mycobacteria has been shown to inhibit the
macrophage response to IFN-gamma. In the current study, we examined the effect of
Mycobacteria avium, Mycobacteria tuberculosis, and TLR2 stimulation on
IFN-gamma-induced gene expression in human PMA-differentiated THP-1 monocytic
cells. Mycobacterial infection inhibited IFN-gamma-induced expression of
HLA-DRalpha and HLA-DRbeta mRNA and partially inhibited CIITA expression but did 
not affect expression of IFN regulatory factor-1 mRNA. To determine whether
inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity could rescue HLA-DR gene
expression, butyric acid and MS-275, inhibitors of HDAC activity, were added at
the time of M. avium or M. tuberculosis infection or TLR2 stimulation. HDAC
inhibition restored the ability of these cells to express HLA-DRalpha and
HLA-DRbeta mRNA in response to IFN-gamma. Histone acetylation induced by
IFN-gamma at the HLA-DRalpha promoter was repressed upon mycobacteria infection
or TLR2 stimulation. HDAC gene expression was not affected by mycobacterial
infection. However, mycobacterial infection or TLR2 stimulation up-regulated
expression of mammalian Sin3A, a corepressor that is required for MHC class II
repression by HDAC. Furthermore, we show that the mammalian Sin3A corepressor is 
associated with the HLA-DRalpha promoter in M. avium-infected THP-1 cells
stimulated with IFN-gamma. Thus, mycobacterial infection of human THP-1 cells
specifically inhibits HLA-DR gene expression by a novel pathway that involves
HDAC complex formation at the HLA-DR promoter, resulting in histone deacetylation
and gene silencing.

1'S-1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate from the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga was known to 
show potent inhibitory effect on the production of nitric oxide (NO) in
lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages. To clarify its
mechanism of action, the effects of 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate on the
expression of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) mRNA and activation of nuclear
factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), both of which participate in the induction of
inducible NO synthase, were examined in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages.
The results were compared with those of two inhibitors of the NF-kappaB
activation, costunolide and caffeic acid phenethyl ester. 1'S-1'-Acetoxychavicol 
acetate inhibited IFN-beta mRNA expression as well as NF-kappaB activation, and
two related compounds, (+/-)-1-acetoxy-1-(2-acetoxyphenyl)-2-propene and
(+/-)-1-acetoxy-1-(4-acetoxyphenol)-3-butene, also inhibited IFN-beta mRNA
expression. In addition, 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate inhibited the production 
of NO stimulated by poly(I:C) via Toll-like receptor 3.

The lipopolysaccharide-triggered mesangial transcriptome: Evaluating the role of 
interferon regulatory factor-1.

Author information: 
(1)Simmons Arthritis Research Center, Division of Rheumatology, Center for
Immunology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.

BACKGROUND: Presently, we do not have a clear picture of how the mesangial
transcriptome evolves following stimulation. The present study was designed to
address this, using an innate trigger to stimulate murine mesangial cells.
METHODS: Three independent mesangial cell lines derived from C57BL/6 mice were
stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The mesangial cell transcriptomes were 
defined 1, 6, 24, and 60 hours poststimulation with LPS, using a 17,000 gene
oligonucleotide array.
RESULTS: Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), ScyA2/MCP1, ScyA20/MIP3alpha
(ScyB1/Gro1, and ScyB2/MIP2alpha/Gro2 were the earliest genes to be
hyperexpressed after LPS stimulation. Later-appearing genes included ScyA7/MCP3, 
ScyD1/fractalkine, GM-CSF/CSF-2, PDGF, epiregulin, NfKb, C/EBP, TIMP-1, MMP11,
MMP13, PTGS2/COX2, SpI2-1, Spp1, PAI-1, VCAM-1, C3, and defensin-beta1, among
others. Several of these changes were validated by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rapid IRF-1
hyperexpression was also noted following stimulation of mesangial cells with
peptidoglycan, poly I:poly C, interferon-gamma?(IFN-gamma), and heat-aggregated
IgG. However, the blocking of IRF-1 using RNA interference and the use of
mesangial cells isolated from IRF-1-deficient mice could not substantiate an
obligatory role for IRF-1 in LPS-induced mesangial cell activation. Likewise,
IRF-1 deficiency did not impact the development of anti-glomerular basement
membrane (GBM)-induced immune nephritis.
CONCLUSION: Innate stimuli such as LPS appear to trigger successive waves of
mesangial cell gene expression. Although IRF-1 surfaces as an "early-on,
early-off" transcription factor following several different triggers, it does not
appear to be an essential molecule for mesangial cell activation by innate
triggers or for anti-GBM disease.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a critical
mediator of interferon (IFN)-induced gene responses. Recently, STAT1 was found to
become modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) conjugation at Lys703
through the SUMO E3 ligase function of protein inhibitors of activated STAT
(PIAS) proteins. However, the physiologic function of sumoylation in STAT1 is
still unclear. Here, we show that mutations in the SUMO attachment site in STAT1 
result in increased transcriptional activity in a fashion that is selective among
IFN-gamma target genes. The sumoylation-defective STAT1 mutant displayed
increased induction of guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) and transporters
associated with antigen presentation 1 (TAP1) transcription but not interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) transcription. Moreover, the sumoylation-defective
mutant STAT1-KR showed a prolonged DNA-binding activity and nuclear localization 
in response to IFN-gamma stimulation. These results suggest that sumoylation has 
a defined negative regulatory effect on selective STAT1-mediated transcription
responses.

Fruits or berries of Hippophae rhamnoides (sea buckthorn), a rich source of
vitamins A, C, and E, carotenes, flavonoids, and microelements such as sulfur,
selenium, zinc, and copper, are edible and have been shown to protect from atopic
dermatitis, hepatic injury, cardiac disease, ulcer, and atherosclerosis. However,
its mechanism of action is not clear. We show that Hippophae inhibits
benzo(a)pyrene-induced forestomach and DMBA-induced skin papillomagenesis in
mouse. This decrease in carcinogenesis may be attributed to the concomitant
induction of phase II enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase and DT-diaphorase
and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione
peroxidase, and glutathione reductase in the mouse liver. This was accompanied by
a remarkable induction of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1
in the Hippophae-treated liver. Our results strongly suggest that Hippophae fruit
is able to decrease carcinogen-induced forestomach and skin tumorigenesis, which 
might involve up-regulation of phase II and antioxidant enzymes as well as
DNA-binding activity of IRF-1, a known antioncogenic transcription factor causing
growth suppression and apoptosis induction for its anticancer effect.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription
factor with antiviral, proinflammatory and tumor suppressor properties. We
examined the role of IRF-1 in dextran sulfate sodium colitis, a murine model of
inflammatory bowel disease, to determine if absence of the gene would protect
against colitis.
METHODS: C57BL/6J mice with a targeted disruption of IRF-1 and wild-type C57BL/6J
controls received five 7-day cycles of 2% dextran sulfate sodium alternating with
five 7-day cycles of water. Colonic tissue was formalin fixed for histological
analysis and total RNA extracted for gene chip and SYBR green real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
RESULTS: Histological analysis revealed increased distortion of crypt
architecture in the dextran sulfate sodium-treated, IRF-1 -/- animals as compared
to dextran sulfate sodium-treated wild-type animals. Five of 15 dextran sulfate
sodium-treated IRF-1 -/- mice, but only one of 14 dextran sulfate sodium-treated 
wild-type mice, developed colonic dysplasia. Microarray analysis comparing
colonic gene expression in IRF-1 -/- and wild-type animals revealed decreased
expression of caspases, genes involved in antigen presentation, and tumor
suppressor genes in the IRF-1 -/- animals. Increased expression of genes involved
in carcinogenesis and immunoglobulin and complement genes was also noted in the
knock-out animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Absence of IRF-1 is not protective in dextran sulfate sodium
colitis.

Involvement of TNF and NF-kappa B in the transcriptional control of
cyclooxygenase-2 expression by IFN-gamma in macrophages.

Author information:

Científicas-Universidad Autónoma, Madrid, Spain.

IFN-gamma induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and PG production in mouse
macrophage cells. IFN-gamma activates COX-2 promoter-driven transcription.
Deletion of the IFN sequence regulatory element (ISRE) I -1541/-1522 and ISRE II 
-1215/-1206 sites of the mouse COX-2 promoter minimally decrease this IFN-gamma
induction. In contrast, deletion of the -965/-150 region from the COX-2 promoter 
abrogated IFN-gamma induction. In this region a NF-kappaB site has been described
and mutation of this site impairs the induction of the full COX-2 promoter by
IFN-gamma. Moreover, IFN-gamma induction of the COX-2 promoter was also strongly 
reduced by transfection of plasmid encoding the NF-kappaB inhibitor,
IkappaBalpha. Interestingly, IFN-gamma induction of the COX-2 and PGE(2)
synthesis was absent in macrophages from TNF(-/-) mice, and neutralizing anti-TNF
Abs inhibited COX-2 promoter induction by IFN-gamma in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
Moreover, NF-kappaB activity was induced late after stimulation with IFN-gamma
correlating with the effect of autocrine TNF, and this NF-kappaB activation was
absent in macrophages from TNF(-/-) mice. Taken together our results suggest a
model in which IFN-gamma-induced TNF activates NF-kappaB, which is required for
full COX-2 expression.

Telomerase activation is regulated by the expression of human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (hTERT) and is a key step in the development of human cancers.
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling induces growth arrest in many tumors
through multiple regulatory mechanisms. The p27 tumor suppressor protein inhibits
the formation of tumors through the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or
apoptosis. We demonstrate here that p27Kip1 inhibits hTERT mRNA expression and
telomerase activity through post-transcriptional up-regulation by IFN-gamma/IRF-1
signaling. The ectopic expression of p27 suppressed hTERT expression and
telomerase activity in human cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and HT3.
Furthermore, hTERT promoter activity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
deficient in p27 (p27-/- MEFs) was significantly higher than that of wild-type
MEFs. Overexpression of p27 suppressed hTERT promoter activity and telomerase
activity of p27-/- MEFs. In addition p27 down-regulated E7 protein expression and
in transiently transfected HeLa cells, E7 increased hTERT promoter activity. In
conclusion, we propose that inhibition of the hTERT expression and telomerase
activity may be a novel tumor suppressor function of p27.

PURPOSE: Several studies showed the effectiveness of combination therapy with
IFN-alpha and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
However, only little is known about the underlying mechanism of combination
therapy. In the present study, we examined whether apoptosis through
IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-alpha/betaR) was associated with the effects of
combination therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HuH7, PLC/PRF/5, HLE, and HLF were treated with IFN- (500
units/mL), 5-FU (0.5 microg/mL), or their combination for 10 days. In addition,
IFN-alpha/betaR gene transfer with combination therapy was done.
RESULTS: Ten-day treatment by combination therapy resulted in >80% cell growth
inhibition. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
analysis showed synergistic effects for combination therapy on PLC/PRF/5, HLE,
and HLF. Concordant results were obtained with DNA fragmentation. Moreover, there
was an evidence showing that changes in the expression of Bcl-2 family lead to
apoptosis. On the other hand, the expression of IFN-alpha/betaR and up-regulation
of alpha-phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, IFN
regulatory factor-1 by combination therapy were observed in all cell lines.
Furthermore, IFN-alpha/type 2 IFN receptor long form-transfected HuH7 cells
treated with combination therapy showed strong DNA fragmentation compared with
nontransfected or transfected with IFN-alpha- and 5-FU-treated HuH7.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that combination of IFN-alpha plus 5-FU strongly 
induced cell growth inhibition of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and
indicated that one of the direct mechanisms of combination therapy may in part be
attributable to alterations in induction of apoptosis through IFN-alpha/betaR.

Activating mutations in ras oncogenes occur at high frequency in human
malignancies and expression of activated ras in immortalized cells lines is
generally transforming. However, somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of
ras in some myeloid cell lines has been shown to induce growth suppression
associated with up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p21(CIP1/WAF1) in a p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), and p53 independent fashion. We have 
used cDNA array technology to compare the expression profile induced by activated
N-ras (N-rasG13R) in growth-suppressed myeloid cells with that induced in myeloid
cells, which are transformed by N-rasG13R. The expression profile induced in
growth suppressed cells was consistent with differentiation and included the
up-regulation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a
known transcriptional activator of p21(CIP/WAF1) expression and a target of
oncogenic mutations associated with myeloid leukemia. Antisense suppression of
IRF-1 prevented N-rasG13R-associated growth arrest and up-regulation of
p21(CIP1/WAF1). These results define a novel tumor suppressive response to
oncogenic signaling and provide a mechanistic link between growth suppression and
differentiation in myeloid cells.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate host cell activation by various microbial
components. TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are the receptors that have
been associated with virus-induced immune response. We have previously reported
that all these TLRs, except TLR9, are expressed at mRNA levels in human
monocyte-derived macrophages. Here we have studied TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8
ligand-induced IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IL-28, and IL-29 expression in human
macrophages. IFN-alpha pretreatment of macrophages was required for efficient
TLR3 and TLR4 agonist-induced activation of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IL-28, and IL-29
genes. TLR7/8 agonist weakly activated IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IL-28, and IL-29
genes, whereas TLR2 agonist was not able to activate these genes. IFN-alpha
enhanced TLR responsiveness in macrophages by up-regulating the expression of
TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7. IFN-alpha also enhanced the expression of TLR signaling
molecules MyD88, TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta, IkappaB
kinase-epsilon, receptor interacting protein 1, and IFN regulatory factor 7.
Furthermore, the activation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 by
TLR3 and TLR4 agonists was dependent on IFN-alpha pretreatment. In conclusion,
our results suggest that IFN-alpha sensitizes cells to microbial recognition by
up-regulating the expression of several TLRs as well as adapter molecules and
kinases involved in TLR signaling.

Regulation of the transcriptional activity of the IRF7 promoter by a pathway
independent of interferon signaling.

Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.

Genes containing an interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE) can be
divided into two groups according to their inducibility by IFN and virus
infection: one induced only by IFN and the other induced by both IFN and virus
infection. Although it is now clear that IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is a
multifunctional gene essential for induction of type I IFNs, regulation of the
IRF7 promoter (IRF7p) is poorly understood. The IRF7 gene includes two IFN
responsive elements, an IRF-binding element (IRFE) in the promoter region and an 
ISRE in the first intron, and is induced by the IFN-triggered Jak-STAT pathway by
binding of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex to the ISRE. In this 
study, we demonstrate that IRF3 and IRF7, which with the coactivators
CREB-binding protein and P300 form the virus-activated factor (VAF) complex upon 
Sendai virus infection, bind to the IRF7 ISRE and IRFE and can directly activate 
IRF7 transcription. Promoter reporter assays show that both the ISRE and IRFE are
responsive to activation by IRF7 and IRF3. In cells transiently expressing IRF7
or/and IRF3, the VAF level and binding of VAF are clearly increased after Sendai 
virus infection. Studies with Jak1 kinase inactive 293 cells that were stably
transfected with a Jak1 kinase dead dominant negative construct, and the mutant
cell lines SAN (IFNalpha-/beta-), U2A (IRF9-), U4A (Jak1-), and DKO (IRF1-/IRF2-)
show that the IRF7 transcription activated directly by VAF is distinct from and
independent of the IFN signaling pathway. Thus, IRF7 transcription is
autoregulated by binding of the IRF7-containing VAF to its own ISRE and IRFE. The
results show two distinct mechanisms for the activation of the IRF7 promoter, by 
IFN and by virus infection. A regulatory network between type I IFNs and IRF7 is 
proposed. The distinct pathways may reflect special roles for an efficient
antiviral response at different stages of virus infection.

Role of acetylases and deacetylase inhibitors in IRF-1-mediated HIV-1 long
terminal repeat transcription.

There is strong evidence that both transcriptional activation and silencing are
mediated through the recruitment of enzymes that control reversible protein
acetylation: histone acetylase (HAT) and histone deacetylase proteins.
Acetylation is also a critical post-translational modification of general and
tissue-specific transcription factors. In HIV-1-infected cells, the long terminal
repeat (LTR) promoter, once organized into chromatin, is transcriptionally
inactive in the absence of stimulation. LTR transcription is regulated by protein
acetylation, since treatment with deacetylase inhibitors markedly induces
transcriptional activity of the LTR. Besides cellular transcription factors
involved in LTR activation, early in infection, and during reactivation from
latency, we have previously shown that proteins of the IRF family play an
important role. In particular, IRF-1 is able per se to stimulate HIV-1 LTR
transcription even in the absence of Tat. IRF-1 is also acetylated and associates
with HATs such as p300/CBP and PCAF to form a multiprotein complex that assembles
on the promoter of target genes. Here we show that CBP can be recruited by IRF-1 
to the HIV-1 LTR promoter even in the absence of Tat and that treatment with
deacetylase inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA), increases LTR
transactivation in response to both IRF-1 and Tat. These results help to define
the architecture of interactions between transcription factors binding HIV-1 LTR 
and confirm the possibility that deacetylase inhibitors, such as TSA, combined
with antiviral therapy may represent a valuable approach to control HIV-1
infection.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) constitute a family of transcriptional
activators and repressors involved in the regulation of immune system, host
defense, and cell growth. All members share conserved DNA-binding domains that
recognize DNA sequences termed IRF-binding elements/IFN-stimulated response
elements (IRF-E/ISRE) present on the promoter of IFN-alpha/beta and
IFN-stimulated genes. An ISRE has been identified downstream of the transcription
start site of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus-1
(HIV-1). Our previous results showed that among the IRF factors, IRF-1 is able to
stimulate HIV-1 LTR transcription and its expression is induced by HIV-1, early, 
upon infection and before the expression of Tat. In this study we investigated
the signal transduction pathway leading to HIV-1-induced IRF-1 expression. Key
IRF-1 promoter elements that mediate the activation of transcription upon
induction by inflammatory cytokines are IFN-gamma-activated sequences that bind
members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family and
binding sites for nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Both STAT-1 and NF-kappaB
activation were examined to determine putative molecular targets whose inhibition
resulted in the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. The results show that at early
time points after HIV-1 infection, NF-kappaB but not STAT-1 is activated.
Moreover, a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication was observed upon de novo
infection of Jurkat T cells expressing an NF-kappaB super-repressor
(IkappaB-alpha 2NDelta4). These results suggest that in early phases of HIV-1
infection, before detectable cytokine production, NF-kappaB seems responsible for
HIV-1-induced IRF-1 expression.

leukemia cells.

M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells exhibit growth arrest and differentiation to
monocytes/macrophages in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
stimulation. Although recent studies have demonstrated that STAT3 plays a central
role in this process, it is unknown whether STAT3 activation alone is sufficient.
To address this issue, we have established M1/STAT3ER cells, where STAT3 is
selectively activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT). 4HT stimulation did not have
any effect on growth and morphology of M1/ STAT3ER cells, and did not induce the 
down-regulation of mRNA of c-myc and c-myb, which is necessary for M1 cell
differentiation. On the other hand, mRNA of jun-B, IRF1 and p19 was increased by 
4HT. DNA precipitation assay indicated that both stimulation of LIF and 4HT
similarly activated STAT3ER. Introduction of a constitutive active MAP kinase
kinase (MEK1) into M1/STAT3ER cells did not induce differentiation either.
Together, our present data suggest that signaling other than the activation of
STAT3 and MEK1 may be necessary for M1 cell-growth arrest and differentiation,
while a set of early genes of LIF are induced by only STAT3 activation.

retinoic acid, bromodeoxyuridine, and the Delta 205 mutant polyoma virus middle T
antigen regulate expression levels of a common ensemble of proteins associated
with early stages of inducing HL-60 leukemic cell differentiation.

USA.

Retinoic acid (RA), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the Delta 205 mutant polyoma
middle T antigen affect the expression of a common ensemble of proteins in HL-60 
human myeloblastic leukemia cells. Each of these agents is known to be able to
prime HL-60 cells and accelerate subsequently induced myeloid or monocytic
differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest, suggesting that they have equal or
identical cellular targets relevant to the early stages of inducing cell
differentiation and G0 arrest. As a test of this possibility, a survey of protein
expression changes induced by RA, BrdU, or Delta 205 transfection was performed. 
Retinoic acid induced numerous changes within h. Bromodeoxyuridine caused larger 
numbers of changes, whereas Delta 205 caused a more limited number. Among the
hundreds of affected proteins detected, there were comparable numbers of up- or
downregulated proteins. A small number changed between undetectable and
detectable expression. The affected proteins were not restricted to a single
functional class and included transcription factors, receptors, signaling
molecules, cytoskeletal molecules, and effectors of various cellular processes
such as deoxyribonucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation. The
intersect of the sets of proteins affected by RA, BrdU, and Delta 205 was
identified to determine if these agents regulated a common subset of proteins.
This ensemble contained the commonly upregulated proteins AF6, ABP-280, ENC-1,
ESE 1, MAP2B, NTF2, casein kinase, IRF1, SRPK2, Rb2, RhoGDI, P47phox, CD45, PKR, 
and SIIIp15. The commonly downregulated proteins were SHC, katanin,
flotillin-2/ESA, EB 1, p43/EMAPIIprecursor, Jab1, FNK. The composition of the
ensemble suggested three apparent themes for cellular processes that were
affected early. The themes reflected the ultimate fate of the treated precursor
cells as a mature myeloid cell, namely a cell whose hallmarks are (1) motility to
migrate to a target and phagocytize it, (2) inducible oxidative metabolism to
reduce the target with superoxide from a respiratory burst, and (3) biosynthetic 
slow down consistent with conversion from cell proliferation to quiescence.
Interestingly, RA appears to induce aspects of an interferon-like response of
potential significance as part of a biosynthetic slow down leading to cell cycle 
arrest. In conclusion, three biologically disparate ways to prime cells to
differentiate were used to filter out a small ensemble of commonly regulated
proteins that group as either microtubule associated, oxidative metabolism
machinery, or effectors of cellular responses to interferon.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum modulates gp91phox gene expression through altered
interferon regulatory factor 1 and PU.1 levels and binding of CCAAT displacement 
protein.

Infection of neutrophil precursors with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative 
agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, results in downregulation of the
gp91(phox) gene, a key component of NADPH oxidase. We now show that repression of
gp91(phox) gene transcription is associated with reduced expression of interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and PU.1 in nuclear extracts of A.
phagocytophilum-infected cells. Loss of PU.1 and IRF-1 correlated with increased 
binding of the repressor, CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), to the promoter of
the gp91(phox) gene. Reduced protein expression of IRF-1 was observed with or
without gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) stimulation, and the defect in IFN-gamma
signaling was associated with diminished binding of phosphorylated Stat1 to the
Stat1 binding element of the IRF-1 promoter. The diminished levels of activator
proteins and enhanced binding of CDP account for the transcriptional inhibition
of the gp91(phox) gene during A. phagocytophilum infection, providing evidence of
the first molecular mechanism that a pathogen uses to alter the regulation of
genes that contribute to an effective respiratory burst.

Cell Death Inhibiting RNA (CDIR) modulates IFN-gamma-stimulated sensitization to 
Fas/CD95/Apo-1 and TRAIL/Apo-2L-induced apoptosis.

We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of Cell Death Inhibiting RNA 
(CDIR), a portion of the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of KIAA0425, inhibits
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (Shchors et al., J
Biol Chem 2002; 277:47061-72). IFN-gamma is known to sensitize cells to killing
induced by the death receptor ligands such as Fas/APO-1/CD95 and TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo-2L). Here we report that while CDIR does not
alter the response of cells to Fas or TRAIL, it significantly modulates
IFN-gamma-induced sensitization of HeLa cells to these death-inducing ligands.
Interestingly, while CDIR abrogates the IFN-gamma-modulated sensitization to Fas,
it enhances the sensitization to TRAIL. Expression of CDIR did not alter initial 
steps of IFN-gamma signaling including induction of Signal Transducer and
Activator-1 (Stat1), caspase-1 or Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF1)
transcription. In contrast, although expression of CDIR does not affect the
protein level of caspase-1 or STAT1, it does significantly reduce the level of
IRF1 protein. Thus, CDIR mediates IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis, at least in part, 
by reducing the level of the pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor gene IRF1 via a
post-transcriptional mechanism. Since tumor cells are often less sensitive to Fas
and more sensitive to TRAIL than normal cells, we suggest that CDIR or CDIR-like 
activity could contribute to such a phenotype of tumor cells.

Interferons alpha and gamma induce p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis,

France.

Type I interferon (IFN) enhances the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene
p53. To elucidate the molecular mechanism mediating IFN-induced apoptosis, we
analysed programmed cell death in response to type I (IFNalpha) or type II
(IFNgamma) treatment in relation to p53 status. In two cell lines (MCF-7, SKNSH),
IFNalpha, but not IFNgamma, enhanced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.
Furthermore, only IFNalpha upregulated p53 as well as p53 target genes (Noxa,
Mdm2 and CD95). The apoptotic response to IFNalpha decreased in the presence of
ZB4, an anti-CD95 antibody, suggesting that CD95 is involved in this process.
When p53 was inactivated by the E6 viral protein or the expression of a p53
mutant, IFNalpha-induced apoptosis and p53 target genes upregulation were
abrogated. Altogether these results demonstrate that p53 plays a pivotal role in 
the IFNalpha-induced apoptotic response. IFNalpha-induced PML was unable to
recruit p53 into nuclear bodies and its downregulation by siRNA did not alter
CD95 expression. In contrast, IFNgamma-induced apoptosis is p53-independent. CD95
and IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) are directly upregulated by this cytokine.
Apoptotic response to IFNgamma is decreased in the presence of ZB4 and strongly
diminished by IRF1 siRNA, implicating both CD95 and IRF1 in IFNgamma-induced
apoptotic response. Taken together, these results show that in two different cell
lines, IFNalpha and IFNgamma, induce p53-dependent -independent apoptosis,
respectively.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcriptional factors
induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Recent studies have indicated that the
deregulation of IRF system in keratinocytes is responsible, at least in part, for
aberrant proliferation and the differentiation of the psoriatic epidermis.
Previously, we reported that the expression of 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen
(BPAG1) gene, which is strictly restricted to basal keratinocytes, is
transcriptionally suppressed by IFN-gamma, but the contribution of IRFs in such
suppression is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of IRFs in 
the regulation of BPAG1 gene expression. Computer analysis identified IRF1 and
IRF2 consensus sequences between -135 and -123 on BPAG1 promoter region.
Transient transfection studies with BPAG1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene
plasmids and IRF1 and IRF2 expression plasmids revealed that IRF1 and IRF2
directly down-regulated BPAG1 gene transcription in cultured normal human
epidermal keratinocytes. Several sets of gel retardation assays with the
BPAG1-IRF binding sequence as a probe indicated that IRF1 and IRF2 could bind to 
the BPAG1-IRF sequence, but some other protein(s), which was induced by IFN-gamma
stimulation and possessed binding activity to IRF consensus sequence, showed
preferential binding to the BPAG1-IRF sequence. Our results suggest that
IFN-gamma-IRF system is involved in BPAG1 gene regulation in type-1 helper T-cell
inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis vulgaris.

Strong evidence of linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms at the IRF6 locus

Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is one of the most common birth
defects, but its etiology is largely unknown. It is very likely that both genetic
and environmental factors contribute to this malformation. Mutations in the gene 
for interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) have been shown to be the cause of Van 
der Woude syndrome, a dominant disorder that has CL/P as a common feature.
Recently, it has been reported that genetic polymorphisms at the IRF6 locus are
associated with nonsyndromic CL/P, with stronger association in Asian and South
American populations. We investigated four markers spanning the IRF6 locus, using
the transmission/disequilibrium test. A sample of 219 Italian triads of patients 
and their parents were enrolled in the study. Strong evidence of linkage
disequilibrium was found between markers and disease in both single-allele
(P=.002 at marker rs2235375) and haplotype (P=.0005) analyses. These findings
confirm the contribution of IRF6 in the etiology of nonsyndromic CL/P and
strongly support its involvement in populations of European ancestry.

The overexpression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin, may provide
tumor cells with a distinct survival advantage in situ; hence, therapeutic
strategies have been designed to inhibit its expression. In this study, we
ectopically expressed the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 protein in the
breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 using a recombinant adenovirus
(Ad-IRF-1). By screening microarray analysis of cDNA from the human breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-468 infected with Ad-IRF-1, we observed a 15-fold
down-regulation of the survivin gene when compared with uninfected cells.
Consequently, we tested survivin expression in Ad-IRF-1-infected MDA-MB-468 and
SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines. Immunoblotting analyses supported the
contention that ectopic expression of the IRF-1 protein results in
down-regulation of survivin protein expression that is independent of p53. In
addition, Ad-IRF-1 infection of these human breast cancer cell lines induces the 
expression of p21. We also report that increased apoptosis is observed in tumor
cells infected with Ad-IRF-1 compared with Ad-Psi5 mock-infected cells and that
cell death is further augmented when the IRF-1-infected cells are cultured with
Adriamycin. Moreover, in a xenogeneic mouse model of breast carcinoma, in vivo
treatment of tumor-bearing mice with intratumoral Ad-IRF-1 injections results in 
tumor growth inhibition. In resected tumors from mice that had been treated with 
Ad-IRF-1, tumor cells that express the IRF-1 transgene have a predominant
IRF-1-positive, survivin-negative phenotype. Collectively, these observations
suggest that therapies designed to enhance IRF-1 expression within tumor cells
may represent novel treatment strategies for breast cancer.

Interferon-gamma mediates neuronal killing of intracellular bacteria.

Jin Y(1), Lundkvist G, Dons L, Kristensson K, Rottenberg ME.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Neurons can be targets for microbes, which could kill the neurons. Just in
reverse, we, in this study, report that bacteria can be killed when entering a
neuron. Primary cultures of foetal mouse hippocampal neurons and a neuronal cell 
line derived from mouse hypothalamus were infected by Listeria monocytogenes.
Treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not affect bacterial uptake, but 
resulted in increased killing of intracellular bacteria, whereas the neuronal
cell remained intact. The IFN-gamma-mediated bacterial killing was mapped to the 
neuronal cytosol, before listerial actin tail formation. Treatment with IFN-gamma
induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT-1 in neurons and
IFN-gamma-mediated listerial killing was not observed in STAT-1(-/-) neurons or
neurons treated with IFN regulatory factor-1 antisense oligonucleotides.
IFN-gamma-treated neuronal cells showed increased levels of inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA, and antisense iNOS oligonucleotides hampered the
bacterial killing by neurons upon IFN-gamma treatment. This novel neuronal
function - i.e., that of a microbe killer - could play a crucial role in the
control of infections in the immuno-privileged nervous system.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member
of the TNF family and a potent inducer of apoptosis. TRAIL has been shown to
effectively limit tumor growth in vivo without detectable cytotoxic side-effects.
Interferon (IFN)-gamma often modulates the anticancer activities of TNF family
members including TRAIL. However, little is known about the mechanism. To explore
the mechanism, A549, HeLa, LNCaP, Hep3B and HepG2 cells were pretreated with
IFN-gamma, and then exposed to TRAIL. IFN-gamma pretreatment augmented
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in all these cell lines. A549 cells were selected and
further characterized for IFN-gamma action in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Western
blotting analyses revealed that IFN-gamma dramatically increased the protein
levels of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, but not TRAIL receptors (DR4 and 
DR5) and pro-apoptotic (FADD and Bax) and anti-apoptotic factors (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, 
cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP). To elucidate the functional role of IRF-1 in
IFN-gamma-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, IRF-1 was first overexpressed by
using an adenoviral vector AdIRF-1. IRF-1 overexpression minimally increased
apoptotic cell death, but significantly enhanced apoptotic cell death induced by 
TRAIL when infected cells were treated with TRAIL. In further experiments using
an antisense oligonucleotide, a specific repression of IRF-1 expression abolished
enhancer activity of IFN-gamma for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, our data
indicate that IFN-gamma enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through IRF-1.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 binding to p300 stimulates DNA-dependent
acetylation of p53.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and p53 control distinct sets of
downstream genes; however, these two antioncogenic transcription factors converge
to regulate p21 gene expression and to inhibit tumor formation. Here we
investigate the mechanism by which IRF-1 and p53 synergize at the p21 promoter
and show that stimulation of p21 transcription by IRF-1 does not require its
DNA-binding activity but relies on the ability of IRF-1 to bind the coactivator
p300 and to stimulate p53-dependent transcription by an allosteric mechanism.
Deletion of the p300-binding sites in IRF-1 eliminates the ability of IRF-1 to
stimulate p53 acetylation and associated p53 activity. Complementing this, small 
peptides derived from the IRF-1-p300 interface can bind to p300, stabilize the
binding of p300 to DNA-bound p53, stimulate p53 acetylation in trans, and
up-regulate p53-dependent activity from the p21 promoter. The nonacetylatable p53
mutant (p53-6KR) cannot be stimulated by IRF-1, further suggesting that p53
acetylation is the mechanism whereby IRF-1 modifies p53 activity. These data
expand the core p300-p53 protein LXXLL and PXXP interface by including an
IRF-1-p300 interface as an allosteric modifier of DNA-dependent acetylation of
p53 at the p21 promoter.

PURPOSE: Small leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) constitute a family of secreted
proteoglycans that are important for collagen fibrillogenesis, cellular growth,
differentiation, and migration. Ten of the 13 known members of the SLRP gene
family are arranged in tandem clusters on human chromosomes 1, 9, and 12. Their
syntenic equivalents are on mouse chromosomes 1, 13, and 10, and rat chromosomes 
13, 17, and 7. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is
evidence for control elements, which could regulate the expression of these
clusters coordinately.
METHODS: Promoters were identified using a comparative genomics approach and
Genomatix software tools. For each gene a set of human, mouse, and rat
orthologous promoters was extracted from genomic sequences. Transcription factor 
(TF) binding site analysis combined with a literature search was performed using 
MatInspector and Genomatix' BiblioSphere. Inspection for the presence of
interspecies conserved scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) was performed 
using ElDorado annotation lists. DNAseI hypersensitivity assay, chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and transient transfection experiments were used to
validate the results from bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: Transcription factor binding site analysis combined with a literature
search revealed co-citations between several SLRPs and TFs Runx2 and IRF1,
indicating that these TFs have potential roles in transcriptional regulation of
the SLRP family members. We therefore inspected all of the SLRP promoter sets for
matches to IRF factors and Runx factors. Positionally conserved binding sites for
the Runt domain TFs were detected in the proximal promoters of chondroadherin
(CHAD) and osteomodulin (OMD) genes. Two significant models (two or more
transcription factor binding sites arranged in a defined order and orientation
within a defined distance range) were derived from these initial promoter sets,
the HOX-Runx (homeodomain-Runt domain), and the ETS-FKHD-STAT (erythroblast
transformation specific-forkhead-signal transducers and activators of
transcription) models. These models were used to scan the genomic sequences of
all 13 SLRP genes. The HOX-Runx model was found within the proximal promoter,
exon 1, or intron 1 sequences of 11 of the 13 SLRP genes. The ETS-FKHD-STAT model
was found in only 5 of these genes. Transient transfections of MG-63 cells and
bovine corneal keratocytes with Runx2 isoforms confirmed the relevance of these
TFs to expression of several SLRP genes. Distribution of the HOX-Runx and
ETS-FKHD-STAT models within 200 kb of genomic sequence on human chromosome 9 and 
500 kb sequence on chromosome 12 also were analyzed. Two regions with 3 HOX-Runx 
matches within a 1,000 bp window were identified on human chromosome 9; one
located between OMD and osteoglycin (OGN)/mimecan genes, and the second located
upstream of the putative extracellular matrix protein 2 (ECM2) promoter. The
intergenic region between OMD and mimecan was shown to coincide with different
patterns of DNAse I hypersensitivity sites in MG-63 and U937 cells. ChiP analysis
revealed that this region binds Runx2 in U937 cells (mimecan transcript note
detectable), but binds Pitx3 in MG-63 cells (expressing high level of mimecan),
thereby demonstrating its functional association with mimecan expression. Upon
comparing the predictions of S/MARs on the relevant chromosomal context of human 
chromosomes 9 and 12 and their rodent equivalents, no convincing evidence was
found that the tandemly arranged genes build a chromosomal loop.
CONCLUSIONS: Twelve of 13 known SLRP genes have at least one HOX-Runx module
match in their promoter, exon 1, intron 1, or intergenic region. Although these
genes are located in different clusters on different chromosomes, the common
HOX-Runx module could be the basis for co-regulated expression.

B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein (Blimp)-1, IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1,
and IRF-2 can bind to the same regulatory sites.

Kuo TC(1), Calame KL.

University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

The transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1)
is expressed in some differentiated cells and is required for terminal
differentiation of B cells. To facilitate identification of Blimp-1 target genes,
we have determined the optimal DNA recognition sequence for Blimp-1. The
consensus is very similar to a subset of sites recognized by IFN regulatory
factors (IRFs) that contain the sequence GAAAG. By binding competition and
determination of equilibrium dissociation constants, we show that Blimp-1, IRF-1,
and IRF-2 have similar binding affinities for functionally important regulatory
sites containing this sequence. However, Blimp-1 does not bind to all IRF sites, 
and specifically does not recognize IRF-4/PU.1 or IRF-8 sites lacking the GAAAG
sequence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that Blimp-1, IRF-1, and
IRF-2 all bind the IFN-beta promoter in vivo, as predicted by the in vitro
binding parameters, and in cotransfections Blimp-1 inhibits IRF-1-dependent
activation of the IFN-beta promoter. Thus, our data suggest that Blimp-1 competes
in vivo with a subset of IRF proteins and help predict the sites and IRF family
members that may be affected.

Methionine deprivation imposes a metabolic stress, termed methionine stress, that
inhibits mitosis and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The
methionine-dependent central nervous system tumor cell lines DAOY
(medulloblastoma), SWB61 (anaplastic oligodendroglioma), SWB40 (anaplastic
astrocytoma), and SWB39 (glioblastoma multiforme) were compared with
methionine-stress resistant SWB77 (glioblastoma multiforme). The cDNA-oligoarray 
analysis and reverse transcription-PCR verification indicated common changes in
gene expression in methionine-dependent cell lines to include
up-regulation/induction of cyclin D1, mitotic arrest deficient (MAD)1, p21,
growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible (GADD)45 alpha, GADD45 gamma, GADD34,
breast cancer (BRCA)1, 14-3-3sigma, B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL)1, transforming
growth factor (TGF)-beta, TGF-beta-induced early response (TIEG), SMAD5, SMAD7,
SMAD2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP7), IGF-R2, vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), 
TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R)2, TNFR-related death
receptor (DR)6, TRAF interacting protein (I-TRAF), IL-6, MDA7, IL-1B convertase
(ICE)-gamma, delta and epsilon, IRF1, IRF5, IRF7, interferon (IFN)-gamma and
receptor components, ISG15, p65-NF-kappaB, JUN-B, positive cofactor (PC)4,
C/ERB-beta, inositol triphosphate receptor I, and methionine adenosyltransferase 
II. On the other hand, cyclins A1, A2, B1 and B2, cell division cycle (CDC)2 and 
its kinase, CDC25 A and B, budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles (BUB)1 and 3,
MAD2, CDC28 protein kinase (CKS)1 and 2, neuroepithelial cell transforming gene
(NET)1, activator of S-phase kinase (ASK), CDC14B phosphatase, BCL2, TGF-beta
activated kinase (TAK)1, TAB1, c-FOS, DNA topoisomerase II, DNA polymerase alpha,
dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, stathmin, and MAP4 were
down-regulated. In the methionine stress-resistant SWB77, only 20% of the above
genes were affected, and then only to a lesser extent. In addition, some of the
changes observed in SWB77 were opposite to those seen in methionine-dependent
tumors, including expression of p21, TRAIL-R2, and TIEG. Despite similarities,
differences between methionine-dependent tumors were substantial, especially in
regard to regulation of cytokine expression. Western blot analysis confirmed that
methionine stress caused the following: (a) a marked increase of GADD45alpha and 
gamma in the wt-p53 cell lines SWB61 and 40; (b) an increase in GADD34 and p21
protein in all of the methionine-dependent lines; and (c) the induction of MDA7
and phospho-p38 in DAOY and SWB39, consistent with marked transcriptional
activation of the former under methionine stress. It was additionally shown that 
methionine stress down-regulated the highly active phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase
pathway by reducing AKT phosphorylation, especially in DAOY and SWB77, and also
reduced the levels of retinoblastoma (Rb) and pRb (P-ser780, P-ser795, and
P-ser807/811), resulting in a shift in favor of unphosphorylated species in all
of the methionine-dependent lines. Immunohistochemical analysis showed marked
inhibition of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappaB under methionine
stress in methionine-dependent lines. In this study we show for the first time
that methionine stress mobilizes several defined cell cycle checkpoints and
proapoptotic pathways while coordinately inhibiting prosurvival mechanisms in
central nervous system tumors. It is clear that methionine stress-induced
cytotoxicity is not restricted by the p53 mutational status.

Synergistic activation of interleukin-12 p35 gene transcription by interferon
regulatory factor-1 and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and interferon consensus sequence-binding 
protein (ICSBP or IRF-8) are two members of the IRF family of transcription
factors that play critical roles in interferon signaling in a wide range of host 
responses to infection and malignancy. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a key factor in 
the induction of innate resistance and generation of T helper type 1 cells and
cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In this work, we find that ICSBP-deficient macrophages
are highly defective in the production of IL-12. The defect is also observed at
the level of IL-12 p40 and p35 mRNA expression. Transcriptional analyses revealed
that ICSBP is a potent activator of the IL-12 p35 gene. It acts through a site
localized to -226 to -219, named ICSBP-response element (ICSBP-RE), in the human 
IL-12 p35 promoter through physical association with IRF-1 both in vitro and in
vivo. Co-expression of ICSBP and IRF-1 synergistically stimulates the IL-12 p35
promoter activity. Mutations at the ICSBP-RE results in the loss of protein
binding as well as transcriptional activation by ICSBP alone or together with
IRF-1. This study provides novel mechanistic information on how signals initiated
during innate and adaptive immune responses synergize to yield greater IL-12
production and sustained cellular immunity.

Myelodysplasia-associated autoimmunity: clinical and pathophysiologic concepts.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), an acquired clonal disorder of haemopoietic
progenitor cells, is characterized by haemopoietic insufficiency associated with 
cytopenias, leading to serious morbidity plus the additional risk of leukaemic
transformation. In MDS an acquired insult to the haemopoietic stem cell leads to 
impaired differentiation and myelodysplasia. However, there is increasing
evidence that the marrow failure of MDS is immune-mediated. A model of MDS
pathophysiology suggests that transformation of normal stem cells induces an
autoimmune T-cell response with the bone marrow as the target organ. This
autoimmune attack results in chronic overproduction of pro-apoptotic cytokines,
especially tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). In addition, several reports 
have revealed that approximately 10% of MDS patients have clinical autoimmune
disorders. This review illustrates the cellular/molecular mechanisms and the
implication of the tumour suppressor gene interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) 
in the pathophysiology of MDS-associated autoimmune deregulation.

Interferon-regulatory factor-1 is critical for tamoxifen-mediated apoptosis in
human mammary epithelial cells.

Unlike estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancers, normal human mammary
epithelial cells (HMECs) typically express low nuclear levels of ER (ER poor). We
previously demonstrated that 1.0 microM tamoxifen (Tam) promotes apoptosis in
acutely damaged ER-poor HMECs through a rapid, 'nonclassic' signaling pathway.
Interferon-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a target of signal transducer and
activator of transcription-1 transcriptional regulation, has been shown to
promote apoptosis following DNA damage. Here we show that 1.0 microM Tam promotes
apoptosis in acutely damaged ER-poor HMECs through IRF-1 induction and
caspase-1/3 activation. Treatment of acutely damaged HMEC-E6 cells with 1.0
microM Tam resulted in recruitment of CBP to the gamma-IFN-activated sequence
element of the IRF-1 promoter, induction of IRF-1, and sequential activation of
caspase-1 and -3. The effects of Tam were blocked by expression of siRNA directed
against IRF-1 and caspase-1 inhibitors. These data indicate that Tam induces
apoptosis in HMEC-E6 cells through a novel IRF-1-mediated signaling pathway that 
results in activated caspase-1 and -3.

Yayoi, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.

Here we describe gene expression profiles of mouse liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells (LSECs) revealed by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). We prepared 
SAGE libraries of LSECs from normal and injured liver by CCl(4) administration,
and we obtained 32,867 tags from normal and 37,493 tags from injured liver,
representing 6011 unique transcripts. CCl(4) administration upregulated several
genes related to cell growth and differentiation (Cdkn1a, Irf1, Il4ra, etc.),
whereas it downregulated genes related to cell growth or protein transport (Kdr, 
Igfbp4, Ap1b1, etc.). To identify genes preferentially expressed in LSEC, we
compared our SAGE libraries with 77 publicly available libraries generated from
various mouse tissues and cell lines. We identified 23 genes, including Stab2 and
uncharacterized genes, as possible markers for LSEC, which will be useful to
analyze the specific role for LSECs in normal as well as regenerating liver.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is pivotal in the regulation of interferon
(IFN)-mediated immune reactions, and studies suggest that IRF-1 is involved in
the development of autoimmune diseases. IRF-1+/+, +/-, and -/- nonobese diabetic 
(NOD) mice were immunized with mouse thyroglobulin (mTg) to determine whether
IRF-1 is required in experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), a murine model
for Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). IRF-1-deficient mice developed EAT and anti-mTg
antibodies comparable to IRF-1+/+ and +/- mice. Whereas both CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells were found in thyroids of IRF-1+/+ mice, the latter was not in IRF-1-/-
mice. Major histocompatibility complex class II antigen was comparably expressed 
in thyroids of IRF-1+/+ and -/- mice. Lack of IRF-1 resulted in decreased CD8+ T 
cell number in the spleen and reduced IFNgamma production by splenocytes. Our
results suggest that IRF-1 is not pivotal in EAT in NOD mice.

The high number (>10(8-10)) of primary human pro-erythroblasts
(CD36high/CD235alow) obtainable in HEMA culture (Migliaccio et al., 2002) is
exploited here to analyse the expression of proteins implicated in erythropoietin
(EPO)-signalling (STATs, PI-3K, and PLCs) during the process of erythroid
maturation. Human pro-erythroblasts progressed in 4 days of culture with EPO into
basophilic- (CD36high/CD235amedium, 24 h), polychromatic-(CD36high/CD235ahigh, 48
h), and, finally, orthochromatic-(CD36low/CD235ahigh, 72-96 h) erythroblasts.
During this maturation, STAT-1 was expressed up to the orthochromatic stage,
expression of STAT-5, as well as of its target proteins BclxL and IRF1, remained 
constant up to 48 h (polychromatic-erythroblasts) but decreased by 96 h
(orthochromatic-erythroblasts), while that of STAT-3 decreased constantly from 24
h on and became undetectable by 96 h. Expression of PI-3K rapidly decreased with 
differentiation since only 50% of original protein levels were detected by 48 h. 
On the other hand, among the members of PLC families investigated, PLC beta4 was 
not expressed, PLC beta2, delta1, and gamma2 were expressed at constant levels
throughout the maturation process, while expression of PLC beta3 and of PLC
gamma1 decreased, as PI-3K, by 24 h and that of PLC beta1 was induced by 6 h and 
became undetectable by 24 h. In conclusion, these data depict the dynamic
signalling scenario associated with the maturation of erythroid cells and provide
the first indication that members of PLC families (PLC beta1, beta3, and gamma1) 
might be involved in the control of erythroid differentiation in humans.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is a transcription factor controlling the
expression of several genes, which are differentially induced depending on the
cell type and signal. IRF-1 modulates multiple functions, including regulation of
immune responses and host defence, cell growth, cytokine signalling and
hematopoietic development. Here, we investigated the role of IRF-1 in
granulocytic differentiation in mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene. We
show that IRF-1(-/-) bone marrow cells exhibit an increased number of immature
granulocytic precursors, associated with a decreased number of mature
granulocytic elements as compared to normal mice, suggestive of a defective
maturation process. Clonogenetic analyses revealed a reduced number of CFU-G,
CFU-M and CFU-GM colonies in IRF-1(-/-) mice, while the number of BFU-E/CFU-E
colonies was unchanged. At the molecular level, the expression of
CAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-epsilon, -alpha and PU.1 was substantially 
lower in the CD11b(+) cells from the bone marrow of IRF-1(-/-) mice as compared
to cells from wild-type mice. These results, together with the fact that IRF-1 is
markedly induced early during granulo-monocytic differentiation of CD34+ cells,
highlight the pivotal role of IRF-1 in the early phases of myelopoiesis.

Unique gene expression profiles of heart allograft rejection in the interferon
regulatory factor-1-deficient mouse.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) is a transcription factor for many genes
involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. By using DNA array technology, 
we have previously demonstrated that IRF1 is significantly upregulated during
acute rejection in rat heart allografts and is restored to isograft levels when
recipients are treated with the immunosuppressants tacrolimus or cyclosporin A
(CsA). To understand the precise role of IRF1 in transplant rejection, we
investigated the rejection responses of mice completely deficient of IRF1
protein. Heterotopic heart transplantations were performed using C57BL/6J
wild-type (WT B6) and IRF1-deficient (IRF1-/-) mice as recipients, and C3H mice
as donors. Graft survival was determined by abdominal palpation and rejection was
confirmed by histology. On day 6 after transplantation, isografts and allografts 
were harvested and subjected to gene expression analysis by a commercial nylon
array and by real-time RT-PCR. Median survival time of heart allografts was 8
days in the WT B6 mice and 10 days in the IRF1-/- mice. The gene expression
profiles of allografts from the WT B6 and IRF1-/- recipients were nearly
identical to each other and very different from the profile of the isograft
control. Both WT B6 and IRF1-/- profiles showed 13 genes upregulated (IFN-gamma, 
MCP-2, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, CCR5, MIG, IP-10 and others) and one gene
downregulated (SDF2) among the 76 genes detectable on the array. In more detailed
analyses, distinct cytokine and chemokine gene expression profiles were
identified in the allografts from the WT B6 and IRF1-/- recipients. Whereas IL-4,
IL-6, IL-13, MCP-1, MCP-3, and MPIF-2 were upregulated, RANTES, IL-2Rgamma and
gp130 were downregulated in allografts from the IRF1-/- recipients when compared 
to the WT B6 control. Although the inactivation of the IRF1 gene did not
sufficiently prevent acute allograft rejection in this model, a unique cytokine
and chemokine gene expression profile was found in the absence of IRF1.

Variation in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection depends on numerous factors, and
host genetic variation has been well-described as an important component. As a
transcriptional regulator, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) plays a key
role in both innate and adaptive immunity against viral infection. IRF-1 has also
been shown to directly interact with HIV-1 5' LTR and efficiently initiate or
amplify HIV-1 replication. By complete gene sequencing, we investigated genetic
polymorphism of the IRF-1 gene in an HIV-1-endemic Kenyan population. This
population displayed extensive genetic diversity at the IRF-1 locus. Fifty-three 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in this population,
including 26 novel SNPs. Two insertion and one deletion polymorphisms in IRF-1
were also identified. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these genetic variations 
was shown to be common in IRF-1. The functional consequences of these mutations
in the context of HIV-1/AIDS remain to be determined. We also identified 35
consistent discrepancies between IRF-1 GenBank sequences and our population based
sequencing data, suggesting that the previously submitted GenBank data were not
representative of the majority of human IRF-1 sequences.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Interferon alpha2a (IFNalpha2a) mediates important
antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory responses and is employed in
the treatment of human diseases, including chronic myelogenous leukemia. Here, we
report the IFNalpha2a-dependent expression profiles of three malignant cell lines
derived from liver, lymphocytes and muscle.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The experiments were performed in the presence of
cycloheximide, thus our results exclusively reflect direct transcriptional
modulation. The short exposure time i.e. 5 hours evidences only the early events,
excluding the effects of complex phenotypic changes on the expression.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that IFNalpha2a rapidly up-regulates the
expression of STAT1, STAT2 and ISGF3G genes. This activity should result in the
amplification of the cellular response to the cytokine. Moreover, IFNalpha2a
directly modulates the expression of: (i) important transcriptional factors, e.g.
IRF1 and IRF7 which control pivotal cellular events, and (ii) enzymes involved in
the IFNalpha2a-dependent antiviral and apoptotic response. Interestingly, we
showed that the cytokine induces transcriptional expression of Sjögren's syndrome
antigen A1, a protein involved in several autoimmune diseases.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes induced by IFNalpha2a could 
be related to the development of autoimmune syndromes observed during IFNalpha2a 
treatment. A number of genes transcriptionally regulated by the cytokine have
been identified for the first time; these might represent additional effectors of
IFNalpha2a activity.

Although a number of transcription factors (TFs) have been identified that play a
pivotal role in the development of hematopoietic lineages, only little is known
about factors that may influence development and lineage commitment of natural
killer (NK) or NK-like T (NKT)-cells. Obviously to fully appreciate the NK- and
NKT-cell differentiation process, it is important to identify and characterize
the TFs effecting the NK- and NKT-cell lineage. Furthermore, these TFs may play a
role in NK- or NKT-cell leukemias, in which the normal differentiation program is
presumably disturbed. The present study analyzed the expression of the following 
13 TFs: AML1, CEBPA, E2A, ETS1, GATA1, GATA2, GATA3, IKAROS, IRF1, PAX5, PU1,
TBET and TCF1 in 7 malignant NK-cell lines together with 5 malignant NKT-cell
lines, 5 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines including 3
gamma/delta T-cell receptor (TCR) type and 2 alpha/beta TCR type, and 3 B-cell
precursor (BCP) leukemia cell lines. AML1, E2A, ETS1, IKAROS and IRF1 were found 
to be positive for all cell lines tested whereas GATA1 turned out to be
universally negative. CEBPA, PAX5 and PU1 were negative for all cell lines tested
except in the three positive BCP-cell lines. GATA2 was positive for 3/5 T-cell
lines but negative for the other cell lines. GATA3 was positive for 7/7 NK-, 4/5 
NKT-, 5/5 T- and 2/3 BCP-cell lines. TBET was positive for all NK- and NKT-cell
lines and negative for all T- and BCP-cell lines except one BCP-cell line. In
contrast to the expression of TBET, TCF1 was negative for all NK- and NKT-cell
lines, being positive for 4/5 T- and 1/3 BCP-cell lines. Expression analysis of
TFs revealed that NK- and NKT-cell lines showed identical profiles, clearly
distinct from those of the other T-ALL or BCP-ALL leukemia-derived cell lines..

IL-4 inhibits proliferation of renal carcinoma cells by increasing the expression
of p21WAF1 and IRF-1.

Yu SJ(1), Kim HS, Cho SW, Sohn J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul,

Interleukin (IL)-4 inhibits proliferation of several human cancer cell lines in
vitro. Although IL-4 is known to regulate proliferation of lymphocytes by
modulating p27KIP1 expression, the mechanism involved in the IL-4-induced growth 
inhibition of nonhematopoietic cancer cells has not been fully elucidated.
Previously, we reported that IL-4 suppressed proliferation of human renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) cell lines in vitro. Here, we show that IL-4 inhibits cell cycle 
progression at the G1 phase in Caki-1 cells by increasing the expression of
p21WAF1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, and decreasing the cyclin
dependent kinase (CDK) 2 activity. Up-regulation of p21WAF1 and IRF-1 expression 
is transcriptional, but independent of p53. The levels of p21WAF1 and IRF-1
proteins were enhanced as early as 1 h after IL-4 treatment. CDK2 activity
started to decline at 4 h after IL-4 treatment, and by 24 h, was approximately
50% of the control. Neither the protein expressions of p27KIP1 and p16INK4a, nor 
the phosphorylation level of pRb was changed. The importance of p21WAF1 and IRF-1
in the growth inhibition induced by IL-4 was confirmed by antisense
oligonucleotide transfection. Both of p21WAF1 and IRF-1 antisense
oligonucleotides prevented IL-4-mediated growth inhibition by approximately 30%
compared to the respective sense oligonucleotides. In summary, our study
indicated that p21WAF1 and IRF-1 mediate the growth inhibitory effect of IL-4 in 
human RCC cells.

Reduction of nitric oxide synthase 2 expression by distamycin A improves survival
from endotoxemia.

NO synthase 2 (NOS2) plays an important role in endotoxemia through
overproduction of NO. Distamycin A (Dist A) belongs to a class of drugs termed
minor-groove DNA binders, which can inhibit transcription factor binding to
AT-rich regions of DNA. We and others have previously shown that AT-rich regions 
of DNA surrounding transcription factor binding sites in the NOS2 promoter are
critical for NOS2 induction by inflammatory stimuli in vitro. Therefore, we
hypothesized that Dist A would attenuate NOS2 up-regulation in vivo during
endotoxemia and improve animal survival. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice treated with
Dist A and LPS (endotoxin) showed significantly improved survival compared with
animals treated with LPS alone. In contrast, LPS-treated C57BL/6 NOS2-deficient
(NOS2-/-) mice did not benefit from the protective effect of Dist A on mortality 
from endotoxemia. Treatment with Dist A resulted in protection from hypotension
in LPS-treated WT mice, but not in NOS2-/- mice. Furthermore, LPS-induced NOS2
expression was attenuated in vivo (WT murine tissues) and in vitro (primary
peritoneal and RAW 264.7 murine macrophages) with addition of Dist A. Dist A
selectively decreased IFN regulatory factor-1 DNA binding in the enhancer region 
of the NOS2 promoter, and this IFN regulatory factor-1 site is critical for the
effect of Dist A in attenuating LPS induction of NOS2. Our data point to a novel 
approach in modulating NOS2 expression in vivo during endotoxemia and suggest the
potential for alternative treatment approaches for critical illness.

Molecular cloning of the viperin gene and its promoter region from the mandarin
fish Siniperca chuatsi.

Sun BJ(1), Nie P.

Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, PR
China.

A viperin gene has been cloned from the mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi). From
the first transcription initiation site, the mandarin fish viperin gene extends
3163 nucleotides to the end of the 3' untranslated region, and it contains six
exons and five introns. The open reading frame of the viperin transcript has 1062
nucleotides which encode a 354 amino acid peptide. The amino acid sequence of
mandarin fish viperin shows high identities with its homologues in teleosts and
mammals except for the first 70 amino acids. A characteristic feature in the
viperin promoter region was the presence of five putative ICSBP (IRF8) binding
sites and one IRF1 binding site. The viperin gene expressed mainly in lymphoid
tissues before stimulation, but its expression can be examined in almost all the 
organs investigated after stimulation with virus or Poly I:C. The expression
pattern and promoter sequence may be considered as the indirect evidence that the
transcription of viperin is regulated by interferons or interferon induced genes.

Effect of various catechins on the IL-12p40 production by murine peritoneal
macrophages and a macrophage cell line, J774.1.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine comprising p40 and p35
subunits produced mainly by monocytes and macrophages, and plays an essential
role in the regulation of the differentiation of Th1 cells. Green tea polyphenols
exhibit potent anti-oxidative activities and anti-inflammatory effects by
modulating cytokine production. We investigated the effect of catechins on
IL-12p40 production in murine macrophages induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Pretreatment with several catechins at doses of 0.3-30 microM suppressed
IL-12 p40 production by murine peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) and J774.1 cells in
a dose-dependent manner. Decreases in protein production were primarily due to
down-regulation of the transcription of IL-12p40 mRNA. Of the various catechins, 
(-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was the most potent inhibitor, followed by
(-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG) and (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG). EGCG inhibited
LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but
not Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while EGCG augmented LPS-induced phosphorylation
of p44/p42 extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). In addition, both EGCG and 
GCG inhibited LPS-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha with concomitant inhibition
of nuclear protein binding to NF-kappaB site and synthesis of IRF-1. These
results suggest that gallate-containing catechins, particularly EGCG, inhibits
LPS-induced IL-12p40 production in murine macrophages by inhibiting p38 MAPK
while enhancing p44/p42 ERK, leading to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha
degradation and NF-kappaB activation.

Cellular antiviral responses are mediated partly by the expression of
interferon-stimulated genes, triggered by viral genomes, their transcripts and
replicative intermediates. Persistent replication of a hepatitis C virus (HCV)
replicon suggests that the replicon does not elicit cellular innate antiviral
responses. In the present study, we investigated regulatory factors of the
interferon-mediated antiviral system in cells expressing an HCV replicon.
Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the baseline activity of the
interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) was significantly lower in cells
harboring the replicon than in naive cells. Among the proteins involved in the
IFN/Jak/STAT pathway and in ISRE activity, the expression level of interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) was found to be significantly lower in cells
harboring the replicon. Transfection of an IRF-1 expression construct into cells 
harboring the replicon caused an increase of ISRE activity, accompanied by
suppression of expression of the HCV replicon. Moreover, in cured Huh7 cells from
which the HCV replicon had been eliminated, the expression levels of IRF-1 and
ISRE activity also were suppressed, demonstrating that the decrease of IRF-1 is
attributable, not to active suppression by the viral proteins, but to adaptation 
of cells that enables replication of the HCV subgenome. The high permissiveness
of the cured cells for the replicon was abolished by transgenic supplementation
of IRF-1 expression. Taken together, IRF-1 is one of the key host factors that
regulate intracellular HCV replication through modulation of
interferon-stimulated-gene-mediated antiviral responses.

Epigenetic silencing of the CIITA gene and posttranscriptional regulation of
class II MHC genes in ocular melanoma cells.

Radosevich M(1), Song Z, Gorga JC, Ksander B, Ono SJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology, University College London, University of London,
Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom.

PURPOSE: Primary uveal melanocytes and many ocular melanoma cells are resistant
to interferon (IFN)-gamma-mediated induction of major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) class II molecule expression. This suppression of class II MHC induction is
considered to be one of the ways in which the eye is able to inhibit inflammatory
responses. However, the mechanism(s) of this suppression is unknown. In this
study, we have probed the molecular basis of this phenotype and report two
distinct mechanisms underlying this phenotype.
METHODS: Primary ocular melanocytes and ocular melanoma cell lines (retaining
this IFN-gamma-resistant class II MHC phenotype) were examined for the expression
of class II MHC molecules on the cell surface by flow cytometry. Class II MHC
gene expression was further examined using Western blot and reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses.
RESULTS: The IFN-gamma signal-transduction pathway was found to be intact by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and transfection of reporter
constructs. The lack of class II MHC gene expression appears to result from at
least two mechanisms: (1) a specific inhibition of CIITA (class II
transactivator) gene expression (reminiscent of trophoblasts), and (2)
posttranscriptional regulation of class II MHC genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The inability of primary uveal melanocytes and ocular melanoma cells
to express class II MHC molecules after treatment with IFN-gamma has been found
to map to two distinct points in the class II MHC biosynthetic pathway. The
predominant mechanism appears to involve the silencing of the endogenous gene
encoding the class II transactivator (CIITA). Here, the blockade does not involve
signal transduction from the IFN-gamma receptor, but rather involves a specific
silencing of the CIITA gene. A second mechanism involves the posttranscriptional 
regulation of class II MHC genes.

The peptide hormone prolactin (PRL) is produced by specialized cells in the
anterior pituitary gland and in a number of sites outside the pituitary. Its
biological actions consist of various roles in reproduction, lactation, and of a 
number of homeostatic biological activities that also include immune functions.
Elevated serum PRL concentrations often correlate with abnormalities in immune
responses. To determine the influence of PRL on human immune cells, human whole
blood cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), supplemented with
various concentrations of human recombinant PRL. We found that PRL, at
concentrations achievable during pregnancy, anesthesia and medication,
significantly amplified interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha) synthesis in LPS-stimulated cultures, in a dose-dependent manner.
Conversely, synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 only increased
significantly at very high concentrations of supplemented PRL. PRL alone was not 
able to induce any measurable secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-10, or IL-12 in
non-stimulated, whole blood cultures. However, we demonstrated that PRL, by
itself or in combination with LPS, causes an increase in the binding activity of 
the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) and interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which are known to promote TNF-alpha and IL-12
secretion. These data suggest that PRL promotes pro-inflammatory immune responses
via NFkappaB and IRF-1, which may affect pathophysiological processes in
physiological hyperprolactinemic states.

Frontline: interferon regulatory factor-1 as a protective gene in intestinal
inflammation: role of TCR gamma delta T cells and interleukin-18-binding protein.

The transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) regulates production and
activity of many inflammatory mediators and cells. Here, we investigated the role
of IRF-1 in intestinal inflammation using clinical and histologic scores;
inflammatory mediators were also measured in colonic tissue. Dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS) or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) was administered to
wild-type (WT) or IRF-1 knockout (KO) mice. DSS or TNBS led to a dramatic
increase in lethality and colitis severity in IRF-1 KO compared with WT mice.
Reduced levels of IFN-gamma and IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP) were observed in 
the colon of IRF-1 KO mice, whereas levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase,
cyclooxygenase-2, phosphorylated STAT-3, chemokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-15, 
and IL-18 were not significantly changed. Intestinal inflammation was not altered
in IFN-gamma KO mice or in WT mice given neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, 
but was increased in mice lacking TCR gamma delta lymphocytes, a population
significantly decreased in the intestine of IRF-1-deficient mice. Administration 
of IL-18BP reversed the increased susceptibility of IRF-1 KO mice to DSS. These
results suggest a protective role for IRF-1 in intestinal inflammation, with a
possible anti-inflammatory and/or restorative role. IL-18BP and TCR gamma delta
cells appear to be critical factors in the anti-inflammatory effects of IRF-1.

Commentary: the role of the IL-18 system and other members of the IL-1R/TLR
superfamily in innate mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease: friend or foe?

Reuter BK(1), Pizarro TT.

Excellence, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville 22908, USA.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are examples of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), and are multifaceted chronic autoimmune disorders with unknown etiology;
to date, there is no known cure. IBD is thought to occur as a result of an
inappropriate immune response to environmental factors in a genetically
predisposed host, and it has become increasingly clear that cytokines play an
important role in this process. In recent years, several groups have provided
evidence that IL-18 is significantly up-regulated during the course of chronic
intestinal inflammation and appears to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of
human IBD, particularly in Crohn's disease. IL-18 is a pleiotropic cytokine with 
several biological functions, but is most commonly associated with its ability to
synergistically induce the expression of IFN-gamma. However, although IL-18 has
been extensively studied in both human IBD as well as in murine models of
colitis, no definitive function of IL-18 during the initiation and perpetuation
of chronic gut inflammation has been firmly established, and its precise role in 
the pathogenesis of IBD has yet to be determined. In light of the recent
observation that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 has the 
ability to regulate the functional activity of IL-18, and concomitantly disease
severity, in a murine model of colitis through altered expression of its
endogenous inhibitor, IL-18-binding protein, this commentary will review what is 
currently known regarding the role of IL-18 in normal mucosal immunity and during
the pathogenesis of IBD.

Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and
STAT1-dependent genes by RET/PTC (rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid

Chimeric RET/PTC (rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma)
oncoproteins are constitutively active tyrosine kinases found in thyroid
papillary carcinoma and nonneoplastic Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although several
proteins have been identified to be substrates of RET/PTC kinases, the pathogenic
roles played by RET/PTC in malignant and benign thyroid diseases and the
molecular mechanisms that are involved are not fully understood. We found that
RET/PTC expression phosphorylates the Y701 residue of STAT1, a type II interferon
(IFN)-responsive protein. RET/PTC-mediated signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation requires RET/PTC kinase activity to be
intact but other tyrosine kinases, such as Janus kinases or c-Src, are not
involved. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 transcriptional activation was not inhibited by
suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 or -3, or protein inhibitors of activated
STAT3 [(protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS3)], but PIAS1 strongly
repressed the RET/PTC-induced transcriptional activity of STAT1. RET/PTC-induced 
STAT1 activation caused IFN regulatory factor-1 expression. We found that STAT1
and IFN regulatory factor-1 cooperated to significantly increase transcription
from type IV IFN-gamma responsive promoters of class II transactivator genes.
Significantly, cells stably expressing RET/PTC expressed class II transactivator 
and showed enhanced de novo membrane expression of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II proteins. Furthermore, RET/PTC1-bearing papillary thyroid 
carcinoma cells strongly expressed MHC class II (human leukocyte-associated
antigen-DR alpha) genes, whereas the surrounding normal tissues did not. Thus,
RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate and activate STAT1. This may lead to enhanced
MHC class II expression, which may explain why the tissues surrounding
RET/PTC-positive cancers are infiltrated with lymphocytes. Such immune
response-promoting activity of RET/PTC may also relate to the development of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Effects of the hepatitis C virus core protein on innate cellular defense
pathways.

Washington, Seattle, WA 98104-2499, USA.

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is thought to contribute to HCV
pathogenesis through its interaction with various signal transduction pathways.
In this study, we explored the interaction of the core protein with innate
defense pathways (interferon [IFN] regulatory factor [IRF], Jak-Stat, and
inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]) in HeLa and Huh7 human cell lines.
Expression of a patient-derived genotype 1b core protein activated human IRF-1
and guanylate-binding protein-2 (GBP-2) promoters, induced IRF-1 mRNA, but failed
to induce IRF-3 phosphorylation. HCV core protein caused dose-dependent induction
of the IFN-beta promoter and IFN-beta mRNA but not the IFN-alpha1 and IFN-alpha4 
promoters. In the presence of IFN-alpha, core expression was associated with
increased IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) binding to the IFN-stimulated
response element (ISRE) and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. Core expression
resulted in dose-dependent activation of the ISRE and gamma activated sequence
(GAS) promoters, in both the absence and the presence of either IFN-alpha or
IFN-gamma. Core stimulated the human iNOS promoter and induced iNOS protein. The 
data indicate that HCV core can modulate IRF, Jak-Stat, and iNOS pathways and
suggest mechanisms by which core could affect HCV persistence and pathogenesis.

Phenyl methimazole inhibits TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 expression in an IFN
regulatory factor-1-dependent manner and reduces monocytic cell adhesion to
endothelial cells.

Proinflammatory cytokine (e.g., TNF-alpha)-induced expression of endothelial cell
adhesion molecules (ECAMs) on the lumenal surface of the vascular endothelium and
a consequent increase in leukocyte adhesion are key aspects of pathological
inflammation. A promising therapeutic approach to diminish aberrant leukocyte
adhesion is, therefore, to inhibit cytokine-induced ECAM expression at the
transcription level. Several studies suggest that methimazole, a compound used
clinically to treat autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease, may also
diminish pathological inflammation by suppressing ECAM expression. In this study 
we probed the hypothesis that a derivative of methimazole, phenyl methimazole
(compound 10), can reduce cytokine-induced ECAM expression and consequent
leukocyte adhesion. We found that compound 10 1) dramatically inhibits
TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expression in human aortic endothelial 
cells (HAEC), has a relatively modest inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha induced
E-selectin expression and has no effect on ICAM-1 expression; 2) significantly
reduces TNF-alpha-induced monocytic (U937) cell adhesion to HAEC under in vitro
flow conditions similar to that present in vivo; 3) inhibits TNF-alpha-induced
IFN regulatory factor-1 binding to VCAM-1 promoter; and 4) reduces
TNF-alpha-induced IRF-1 expression in HAEC. Combined, the results indicate that
phenyl methimazole can reduce TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 expression in an IFN
regulatory factor-1-dependent manner and that this contributes significantly to
reduced monocytic cell adhesion to TNF-alpha-activated HAEC.

Protein-DNA array-based identification of transcription factor activities

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates gene expression by binding specific
sequence elements within the promoters of target genes or by cross-talk with
other transcription factors (TFs). For some TFs, interaction with the GR results 
in alteration of DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. We used a
protein-DNA array, a system that facilitates simultaneous profiling of the
activities of multiple transcription factors, to systematically examine the
potential cross-talk of GRalpha with 149 TFs. Using this array, we identified
several TFs, including IRF, E47, and COUP-TF, whose DNA binding activities were
modulated by GRalpha. We then confirmed these results with in vitro
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo reporter assays. In this study,
IRF and E47 were identified as participants in GRalpha cross-talk for the first
time. This new finding expands our understanding of the functional role of
GRalpha in the context of gene expression regulation.

IFN-gamma/STAT1 acts as a proinflammatory signal in T cell-mediated hepatitis via
induction of multiple chemokines and adhesion molecules: a critical role of
IRF-1.

We have previously shown that IFN-gamma/STAT1 plays an essential role in
concanavalin A (ConA)-induced T cell hepatitis via activation of apoptotic
signaling pathways. Here we demonstrate that IFN-gamma/STAT1 also plays a crucial
role in leukocyte infiltration into the liver in T cell hepatitis. After
injection of ConA, leukocytes were significantly infiltrated into the liver,
which was suppressed in IFN-gamma(-/-) and STAT1(-/-) mice. Disruption of the IFN
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene, a downstream target of IFN-gamma/STAT1,
abolished ConA-induced liver injury and suppressed leukocyte infiltration into
the liver. Additionally, ConA injection induced expression of a wide variety of
chemokines and adhesion molecules in the liver. Among them, expression of ICAM-1,
VCAM-1, monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig), CC chemokine ligand-20, epithelial
cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA)-78, IFN-inducible T cell-alpha
chemoattractant (I-TAC), and IFN-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) was markedly
attenuated in IFN-gamma(-/-), STAT1(-/-), and IRF-1(-/-) mice. In primary mouse
hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells, in vitro treatment with
IFN-gamma activated STAT1, STAT3, and IRF-1, and induced expression of VCAM-1,
ICAM-1, Mig, ENA-78, I-TAC, and IP-10 mRNA. Induction of these chemokines and
adhesion molecules was markedly diminished in STAT1(-/-) and IRF-1(-/-) hepatic
cells compared with wild-type hepatic cells. These findings suggest that in
addition to induction of apoptosis, previously well documented, IFN-gamma also
stimulated hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells partly
via an STAT1/IRF-1-dependent mechanism to produce multiple chemokines and
adhesive molecules responsible for promoting infiltration of leukocytes and,
ultimately, resulting in hepatitis.

Aloe-emodin (AE) is a plant-derived hydroxyanthraquinone with potential
anticancer activity. We investigated the ability of AE to modulate survival of
mouse L929 fibrosarcoma and rat C6 astrocytoma cells through interference with
the activation of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) and subsequent
production of tumoricidal free radical NO. Somewhat surprisingly, AE in a
dose-dependent manner rescued interferon-gamma + interleukin-1-stimulated L929
cells from NO-dependent killing by reducing their autotoxic NO release. The
observed protective effect was less pronounced in C6 cells, due to their higher
sensitivity to a direct toxic action of the drug. AE-mediated inhibition of tumor
cell NO release coincided with a reduction in cytokine-induced accumulation of
transcription and translation products of genes encoding inducible NOS and its
transcription factor IRF-1, while activation of NF-kappaB remained unaltered.
These data indicate that the influence of AE on tumor growth might be more
complex that previously recognized, the net effect being determined by the
balance between the two opposing actions of the drug: its capacity to directly
kill tumor cells, but also to protect them from NO-mediated toxicity.

Tumor suppressor IRF-1 mediates retinoid and interferon anticancer signaling to
death ligand TRAIL.

Strasbourg, France.

Retinoids and interferons are signaling molecules with pronounced anticancer
activity. We show that in both acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer
cells the retinoic acid (RA) and interferon signaling pathways converge on the
promoter of the tumoricidal death ligand TRAIL. Promoter mapping, chromatin
immunoprecipitation and RNA interference reveal that retinoid-induced interferon 
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a tumor suppressor, is critically required for TRAIL
induction by both RA and IFNgamma. Exposure of breast cancer cells to both
antitumor agents results in enhanced TRAIL promoter occupancy by IRF-1 and
coactivator recruitment, leading to strong histone acetylation and synergistic
induction of TRAIL expression. In coculture experiments, pre-exposure of breast
cancer cells to RA and IFNgamma induced a dramatic TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in
heterologous cancer cells in a paracrine mode of action, while normal cells were 
not affected. Our results identify a novel TRAIL-mediated tumor suppressor
activity of IRF-1 and suggest a mechanistic basis for the synergistic antitumor
activities of certain retinoids and interferons. These data argue for combination
therapies that activate the TRAIL pathway to eradicate tumor cells.

IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a critical effector molecule in IFN signaling 
and acts as a tumor suppressor and tumor susceptibility gene. IL-12 is a key
factor in the induction of innate resistance and generation of Th1 cells and CTL.
Our recent study has revealed an intimate relationship between IRF-1 and IL-12 in
that IRF-1 regulates the production of IL-12 by selectively controlling
transcriptional activation of IL-12 p35 gene. In this work, we find that
IRF-1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea
(MNU)-induced T lymphomas. This susceptibility is associated with strong defects 
in the expression of IL-12, lymphotoxin (LT)beta, and IFN-gamma. Consistently,
IL-12 p35(-/-), IFN-gamma(-/-), and LTbeta(-/-) mice are also highly vulnerable
to MNU-induced carcinogenesis. Administration of rIL-12 to IRF-1(-/-) mice
restores normal expression of LTbeta and IFN-gamma, and significantly enhances
the ability of IRF-1(-/-) mice to resist MNU-induced pathogenesis. This strongly 
suggests an IRF-1/IL-12/IFN-gamma regulatory axis in tumor surveillance. By DNA
microarray analysis, we comprehensively identify differences and patterns in gene
expression in splenocytes of wild-type (WT) vs IRF-1(-/-) mice challenged with
MNU. This study contributes to efforts to elucidate the cellular/molecular
mechanisms and the downstream players involved in IRF-1-mediated host defense
against lymphoproliferative malignancies.

Defective clearance of adenovirus in IRF-1 mice associated with defects in NK and
T cells but not macrophages.

A replication-defective adenovirus-LacZ recombinant virus (AdLacZ) was injected
intravenously into IRF-1(-/-) mice and wild-type mice to characterize the
contribution of IRF-1 to the immune-mediated clearance of Ad vector. Compared
with wild-type mice, IRF-1(-/-) mice expressed higher levels of the LacZ gene
product in the liver. After infusion of the AdLacZ, the expression of IRF-1 mRNA 
was upregulated in the liver of wild-type mice, but not in IRF-1(-/-) mice. Both 
spleen and liver mononuclear cells from IRF-1(-/-) mice initially exhibited a
markedly lower number of NK, NK-T and CD8 T cells. At day 7 after the
administration of AdLacZ, there was a significantly increased population of NK,
NK-T and CD8 T cells in both spleen and liver, and also CD11b(+) cells in liver
of IRF-1(-/-) mice, compared with the increased in wild-type mice. As IRF-1 is an
important signal for production of IFN-gamma by CD8 T and NK cells as well as
production of IL-12 by CD11b(+) cells, we determined whether there were lower
levels of these cytokines in IRF-1(-/-) mice after Ad challenge. Surprisingly,
there were lower levels of IL-12, but higher levels of IFN-gamma and IL-18 in
IRF-1(-/-) compared with wild-type mice at day 7 after administration with
AdLacZ. These results indicate that delayed clearance of Ad is associated with
partial correction of defects of the NK, NK-T and CD8 T cells and increased
production of IFN-gamma and IL-18 in IRF-1(-/-) mice.

Intestinal epithelial cell-derived interleukin (IL)-7 functions as a pleiotropic 
and nonredundant cytokine in the human intestinal mucosa; however, the molecular 
basis of its production has remained totally unknown. We here showed that human
intestinal epithelial cells both constitutively and when induced by gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) produced IL-7, while several other factors we tested had
no effect. Transcriptional regulation via an IFN regulatory factor element
(IRF-E) on the 5' flanking region, which lacks canonical core promoter sequences,
was pivotal for both modes of IL-7 expression. IRF-1 and IRF-2, the latter of
which is generally known as a transcriptional repressor, were shown to interact
with IRF-E and transactivate IL-7 gene expression in an IFN-gamma-inducible and
constitutive manner, respectively. Indeed, tetracycline-inducible expression
experiments revealed that both of these IRF proteins up-regulated IL-7 protein
production, and their exclusive roles were further confirmed by small interfering
RNA-mediated gene silencing systems. Moreover, these IRFs displayed distinct
properties concerning the profile of IL-7 transcripts upon activation and
expression patterns within human colonic epithelial tissues. These results
suggest that the functional interplay between IRF-1 and IRF-2 serves as an
elaborate and cooperative mechanism for timely as well as continuous regulation
of IL-7 production that is essential for local immune regulation within human
intestinal mucosa.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a transcription
factor known to participate in antiviral responses, acts as a tumor suppressor
inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis. To study the role of STAT1 in DNA
damage-induced apoptosis in B lymphocytes, its active form, STAT1alpha, was
specifically inhibited by the overexpression of STAT1beta, the STAT1alpha
truncated inhibitory isoform. An episomal vector with a tetracycline-inducible
bidirectional promoter was created to induce the expression of 2 proteins,
STAT1beta and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The same vector was
used to overexpress STAT1alpha as a control. Expression of STAT1beta inhibited
the phosphorylation, the DNA-binding activity, and the transcriptional activity
of STAT1alpha, as well as the expression of STAT1alpha target genes such as
p21WAF1/CIP1, TAP1, IRF1, and PKR. Inhibiting STAT1alpha by STAT1beta increased
the growth rate of transfected cells and their resistance to fludarabine-induced 
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Overexpressing STAT1beta reversed the negative
regulation of Mdm2 expression observed after treatment with interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma), which activates STAT1, or with fludarabine. Nuclear translocation of
p53 after fludarabine treatment was decreased when STAT1beta was overexpressed,
and it was increased when STAT1alpha was induced. Oligonucleotide pull-down
experiments showed a physical STAT1/p53 interaction. Our results show that
imbalance between the antiproliferative/proapoptotic isoform STAT1alpha and the
proliferative isoform STAT1beta is likely to play a crucial role in the
regulation of proliferation and apoptosis and that STAT1alpha may regulate p53
activity and sensitize B cells to fludarabine-induced apoptosis.

Growth inhibition by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 has been attributed 
to the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, among which p21/Waf1
plays a major role in many biological contexts. In the present study, two new
intracellular mediators for the induction of p21/Waf1 by TGF-beta 1 were
identified in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (JHH-5) expressing
mutant-type p53. After addition of TGF-beta 1 to JHH-5 cells, a marked increase
of the p21/Waf1 expression preceded the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Expression
of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1, a known transacting factor for p21/Waf1
promoter, was elevated just before or in parallel with the increase of p21/Waf1. 
Transduction of antisense IRF-1 inhibited the increase in p21/Waf1 in JHH-5 cells
treated with TGF-beta 1 and partially released the cells from the growth arrest
by TGF-beta 1. Expression of S100C/A11, a member of the Ca(2+)-binding S100
protein family, also markedly increased after addition of TGF-beta 1. S100C/A11
protein was translocated to and accumulated in nuclei of TGF-beta 1-treated JHH-5
cells, where p21/Waf1 was concomitantly accumulated. When a recombinant S100C/A11
protein was introduced into nuclei of JHH-5 cells, DNA synthesis was markedly
inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of TGF-beta 1. Prior
transfection of p21/Waf1-targeted small interfering RNA efficiently blocked
decrease of DNA synthesis in JHH-5 cells caused by TAT-S100C/A11 or TGF-beta 1
and markedly inhibited expression of p21/Waf1 protein in the cells. These results
indicate that IRF-1 and S100C/A11 mediate growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 via
induction of p21/Waf1.

Histone deacetylase activity is required to recruit RNA polymerase II to the
promoters of selected interferon-stimulated early response genes.

Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.

Posttranslational modification of histones by acetylation, methylation or
phosphorylation has emerged as a major mechanism to modify chromatin structure
and gene expression. In most cases, transcriptionally active genes display
enhanced binding of acetylated histones in their promoters. Activation of histone
acetyltransferases or inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) allows chromatin
to assume a more open state permitting transcriptional activators to form a
preinitiation complex. To our surprise, treatment of cells with the HDAC
inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), inhibits selected interferon beta
(IFNbeta)-stimulated immediate early genes that are activated by the
transcription factors Stat1 and Stat2. However, IFNbeta activation of IRF-1,
which requires tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 homodimers binding to a gamma
interferon activation sequence in its promoter is not affected by TSA. Exposure
of cells to TSA does not alter tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat2. TSA
treatment of cells also does not alter the binding of Stat 1 or Stat2 to the
endogenous ISG54 promoter. However, IFNbeta-stimulated binding of RNA polymerase 
II to the ISG54 promoter is prevented by TSA. Interestingly, ectopic expression
of IRF9 reverses the inhibitory actions of TSA, suggesting that IRF9 functions to
recruit RNA polymerase II to the promoter of interferon-stimulated genes. This
particular function of IRF9 requires the activity of histone deacetylases.

We previously described that mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos express
the two subunits of interferon-gamma receptor. We now report that, despite the
presence of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) at both
the mRNA and protein levels, interferon gamma (IFNgamma) as well as IFNalpha are 
unable to trigger massive nuclear translocation of STAT1 in these cells, even at 
high cytokine concentrations. Conversely, nuclear accumulation of STAT1 was
readily observed in murine L929 somatic cells under the same conditions. However,
in the absence of any stimulation, both tyrosine (Y701p) and serine (S727p)
phosphorylated forms of STAT1 were already detected in the nuclei of oocytes and 
early embryos. Phosphorylated STAT1 appeared concentrated in large nuclear dots, 
which were identified by indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy as
clusters of interchromatin granules (IGCs or speckles). A similar distribution
was also observed for the serine (S727p) phosphorylated form of STAT3 as well as 
for tyrosine (Y689p) phosphorylated STAT2. Western blot analysis confirmed that
STAT factors present in mouse oocytes are predominantly phosphorylated. In
parallel, we showed that the transcription of two IFNgamma-target genes, namely
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling-1
(SOCS-1) is indeed increased in two-cell embryos in response to IFNgamma.
Altogether, our results suggest that, despite the lack of massive nuclear
accumulation of STAT1 in response to exogenous IFNs and the permanent presence of
phosphorylated STATs in the nucleus, JAK/ STAT pathways are functional during
early development.

This publication describes the cloning of full or partial length sequences for
pig TBX21 (T-bet), MYD88, ICSBP1, CD8A (CD8alpha), CD8B (CD8beta), and CD28
cDNAs. Real-time PCR assays have been developed for the relative quantitation of 
these products as well as previously characterized transcripts that encode exon
A-containing CD45, HLX1, IRF1, STAT1 and RPL32. When used for examining temporal 
immune gene expression in the liver of Toxoplasma gondii infected pigs, the
positive regulators of Th1 responses, IRF1, MYD88, and STAT1, were found to be
expressed prior to the simultaneous upregulation of interferon gamma (IFNG), HLX1
and TBX21 gene expression. In contrast, in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN), only 
expression of IRF1 and IFNG was significantly upregulated. Based on their
demonstrated utility in establishing an immune response pathway, these PCR assays
should be valuable additions to our swine immune toolkit.

Antiestrogens induce both cytostasis (cell cycle arrest) and apoptosis, but the
relationship between these end points and the signaling that regulates their
induction are unclear. We have previously implicated the transcription factor and
putative tumor suppressor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in acquired
antiestrogen resistance (Gu et al., Cancer Res, 62: 3428-3437, 2002). We now show
the functional significance of IRF-1 in affecting antiestrogen responsiveness in 
estrogen receptor-positive antiestrogen-sensitive models (MCF-7, T47D, and
ZR-75-1), a model of acquired antiestrogen resistance (MCF7/LCC9; estrogen
receptor positive), and a model of de novo antiestrogen resistance (MDA-MB-231;
estrogen receptor negative). Basal IRF-1 mRNA expression is lower in MCF7/LCC9
cells when compared with MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75-1 cells. IRF-1 transcriptional
activity in MCF-7/LCC9 cells is 18-fold lower than that seen in the parental
cells (MCF-7/LCC1) and is comparable with that in MDA-MB-231 cells. Although
IRF-1 mRNA expression is induced by ICI 182,780 in sensitive cells, this
regulation is lost in MCF-7/LCC9 and is absent in MDA-MB-231 cells. Loss of IRF-1
regulation appears specific to antiestrogen resistance-resistant cells induce
IRF-1 mRNA in response to the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin. A dominant-negative
IRF-1 eliminates the ICI 182,780-induced apoptotic response (reduced >4-fold) and
reduces MCF-7 and T47D cell sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of ICI
182,780. This effect is not mediated by changes in cell cycle distribution;
rather, dominant-negative IRF-1 reduces ICI 182,780-induced apoptosis. These data
identify a novel mechanism of antiestrogen resistance and implicate IRF-1 as a
key component in signaling some ER-mediated effects on apoptosis/cell survival.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) suppression and derepression during

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a tumor suppressor gene presumed to be 
involved in the control of cellular proliferation and transformation. Given that 
the IRF-1 is consistently expressed in the normally cycling endometrium, the
question was raised of the possible role of IRF-1 in the genesis of endometrial
adenocarcinoma. A series of 25 normal and 86 malignant endometria was
investigated using immunohistochemical techniques and the anti-IRF-1 polyclonal
antibody c-20. Normal endometrial glands were, indeed, consistently reactive with
IRF-1. Excluding the invading tumor front, malignant endometria were deprived of 
IRF-1 reactivity, as 81 of the 86 cases (94.2%) were negative for this antigen.
At the invading tumor front, however, IRF-1 was derepressed in tumor cells in 35%
of the cases. This phenomenon was independent of the extent of lymphocytic
response, but it was associated with thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression.
Furthermore, TP up-regulation and host's lymphocytic response in the area were
directly associated. IRF-1 derepression by invading tumor cells was associated
with poor prognosis, independently of FIGO stage. It is concluded that
down-regulation of IRF-1 is a constant finding in endometrial tumorigenesis.
However, derepression of IRF-1 may occur in a subset of tumors, and this event is
associated with TP up-regulation and aggressive tumor behavior.

17beta-Estradiol inhibits class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
expression: influence on histone modifications and cbp recruitment to the class
II MHC promoter.

Avenue South, MCLM 395, Birmingham, Alabama 35294-0005, USA.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins are important for the
initiation of immune responses and are essential for specific recognition of
foreign antigens by the immune system. Regulation of class II MHC expression
primarily occurs at the transcriptional level. The class II transactivator
protein is the master regulator that is essential for both constitutive and
interferon-gamma-inducible class II MHC expression. Estrogen [17beta-estradiol
(17beta-E2)] has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we
show that 17beta-E2 down-regulates interferon-gamma inducible class II MHC
protein levels on brain endothelial cells, as well as other cell types
(astrocytes, fibrosacroma cells, macrophages). The inhibitory effects of
17beta-E2 on class II MHC expression are not due to changes in class II
transactivator mRNA or protein levels, rather, 17beta-E2 mediates inhibition at
the level of class II MHC gene expression. We demonstrate that 17beta-E2
attenuates H3 and H4 histone acetylation and cAMP response element binding
protein-binding protein association with the class II MHC promoter, suggesting
that 17beta-E2 inhibits class II MHC expression by a novel mechanism involving
modification of the histone acetylation status of the class II MHC promoter.

Burkholderia pseudomallei is a causative agent of melioidosis. This Gram-negative
bacterium is able to survive and multiple inside both phagocytic and
nonphagocytic cells. We previously reported that exogenous interferons (both type
I and type II) enhanced antimicrobial activity of the macrophages infected with
B. pseudomallei by up-regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This
enzyme thus plays an essential role in controlling intracellular growth of
bacteria. In the present study we extended our investigation, analysing the
mechanism(s) by which the two types of interferons (IFNs) regulate antimicrobial 
activity in the B. pseudomallei-infected macrophages. Mouse macrophage cell line 
(RAW 264.7) that was exposed simultaneously to B. pseudomallei and type I IFN
(IFN-beta) expressed high levels of iNOS, leading to enhanced intracellular
killing of the bacteria. However, neither enhanced iNOS expression nor
intracellular bacterial killing was observed when the macrophages were
preactivated with IFN-beta prior to being infected with B. pseudomallei. On the
contrary, the timing of exposure was not critical for the type II IFN (IFN-gamma)
because when the cells were either prestimulated or co-stimulated with IFN-gamma,
both iNOS expression and intracellular killing capacity were enhanced. The
differences by which these two IFNs regulate antimicrobial activity may be
related to the fact that IFN-gamma was able to induce more sustained interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) expression compared with the cells activated with
IFN-beta.

BACKGROUND: Patients with myelodysplasia may have autoimmune manifestations
(AIM). Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor involved 
in interferon signalling, leukaemogenesis, and the development of the immune
system.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether IRF-1 is implicated in the pathophysiology of
AIM in myelodysplasia.
METHODS: 14 patients with myelodysplasia were studied, seven with AIM and seven
without. Five patients with vasculitis and seven normal subjects served as
controls. The expression of IRF-1 was studied in bone marrow mononuclear cells
taken from patients and controls, using a relative quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A 10-fold reduction in full length IRF-1 mRNA was detected in the
myelodysplasia patients without AIM compared with the normal controls. In
contrast, the group with AIM had increased IRF-1 transcripts, to a level almost
equal to that observed in patients with vasculitis and normal controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Myelodysplasia patients without IRF-1 expression had a decreased
incidence of AIM. Thus the absence of IRF-1 transcription factor appears to
protect against the development of autoimmunity in myelodysplasia.

Growth arrest of epithelial cells during measles virus infection is caused by
upregulation of interferon regulatory factor 1.

Natural infection with measles virus (MeV) is initiated when the virus reaches
epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, oropharynx, or conjunctivae. Human
epithelial cells infected with MeV frequently show growth suppression. In this
study, we investigated the possible mechanisms for this suppression. The
bronchiolar epithelial cell A549 showed growth arrest in G(0)/G(1) following MeV 
infection or treatment with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) was upregulated during MeV infection, although A549 did not produce
IFN-gamma. Cells of the cervical squamous cell line SiHa persistently infected
with various strains of MeV displayed slower growth than uninfected SiHa cells,
although the growth rates varied depending on the MeV strain. Transfection of
antisense-oriented IRF-1 cDNA released the MeV-infected SiHa cells from growth
suppression. Although these infected cells did not produce IFN-gamma and
suppressed IFN-alpha/beta-induced Jak1 phosphorylation, Jak1 was constitutively
phosphorylated. The growth rates negatively correlated with levels of both IRF-1 
expression and constitutively phosphorylated Jak1. These results indicate that
MeV upregulates IRF-1 in a manner that is independent of IFN but dependent on the
JAK/STAT pathway. This induction of IRF-1 appears to suppress cell growth,
although the extent seems to vary among MeV strains.

Study of the effects of interferon a on several human hepatoma cell lines:
analysis of the signalling pathway of the cytokine and of its effects on
apoptosis and cell proliferation.

BACKGROUND: Interferon alpha (IFNalpha), currently used for the treatment of
chronic viral hepatitis, is also known to prevent the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the mechanism of this action being still
debatable.
AIMS: To study thoroughly in human hepatoma cell lines (HHL)--Hep3B, HepG2, HuH7,
SKHep1, and Chang-Liver--submitted to rhIFNalpha, the signalling pathway of
IFNalpha, the binding activity of the cytokine on specific gamma-activated
sequence (GAS) and interferon-stimulated regulatory element (ISRE) nuclear
sequences, and its effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation.
METHODS: The behaviour of signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT)1, STAT2, p48(IRF9) and the binding of nuclear proteins were investigated
by immunoblot and electro-mobility shift assay. Expression of some
IFNalpha-dependent proteins--p21/(WAF1), inducible nitric oxide synthase, IRF1
and 2--were studied by immunoblot. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were studied by
morphological and biochemical methods.
RESULTS: Transduction of INFalpha was unaltered, although there were some
variations in the different HHL. Nuclear protein binding to GAS or ISRE showed
that ISRE was mainly involved. Apoptosis did not occur. The cell cycle was
slightly modified in HuH7. Three GAS- and/or ISRE-dependent proteins increased,
suggesting that IFNalpha may have some biological effects on HHL.
CONCLUSIONS: The IFNalpha signalling pathway is functional in several HHL, but
the cytokine has no apoptotic effect and a moderate anti-proliferative effect.
This suggests that the preventive role of IFNalpha on HCC cannot be explained by 
an apoptotic and/or an anti-proliferative effect, but possibly by its action on
several specific nuclear sequences that protect liver cells from transformation.

Type I interferon and TNFalpha cooperate with type II interferon for TRAIL
induction and triggering of apoptosis in SK-N-MC EWING tumor cells.

Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common human bone tumor in childhood. Here, we
investigated the sensitivity of the Ewing tumor cell line, SK-N-MC, to the
apoptotic effect of type I (IFNalpha) and type II (IFNgamma) interferons and
TNFalpha. We demonstrate that although IFNalpha and TNFalpha alone are unable to 
induce cell death, they act in synergy with IFNgamma to induce SK-N-MC cell
apoptosis. The synergistic induction of apoptosis correlated with the synergistic
induction of TNFalpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mRNA and TRAIL
protein synthesis as well as of TRAIL secretion. Preparations of inducer-free
supernatants from SK-N-MC cells stimulated with combinations of cytokines were
shown to be cytotoxic for untreated SK-N-MC cells. This cytotoxicity was
partially inhibited by addition of TRAILR2/Fc fusion protein, indicating that the
secreted TRAIL mediates, at least in part, the apoptotic effect displayed by the 
supernatants of stimulated SK-N-MC cells. We have shown that the presence of
IFNgamma is required to allow the sustained expression of IRF1 in SK-N-MC cells
stimulated by addition of IFNalpha or TNFalpha suggesting that IRF1 plays a role 
in the synergistic induction of apoptosis by combinations of cytokines.
Furthermore, we have shown that inhibition of NF-kappaB activation contributes to
the IFNgamma-mediated sensitization to the apoptotic effect of TNFalpha. To our
knowledge, this is the first report showing that interferon/cytokine combinations
are able to induce TRAIL gene expression and TRAIL protein synthesis and
secretion in Ewing sarcoma-derived cells. We believe that the observations
reported here might contribute to the development of alternative new approaches
to the treatment of Ewing tumors resistant to conventional therapy.

The exonuclease ISG20 is directly induced by synthetic dsRNA via NF-kappaB and
IRF1 activation.

Many interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes are also induced by double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA), a component closely associated with the IFN system in the context of
virus-host interactions. Recently, we demonstrated that the IFN-induced 3' --> 5'
exonuclease ISG20 possesses antiviral activities against RNA viruses. Here we
show that ISG20 induction by synthetic dsRNA (pIpC) is stronger and faster than
its induction by IFN. Two families of transcription factors are implicated in the
transcriptional activation of ISG20 by dsRNA. Initially, the NF-kappaB factors
p50 and p65 bind and activate the kappaB element of the Isg20 promoter. This is
followed by IRF1 binding to the ISRE. As pIpC often induces protein movements in 
the cells, we questioned whether it could influence ISG20 localization.
Interestingly and contrary to IFN, dsRNA induces a nuclear matrix enrichment of
the ISG20 protein. dsRNA induction of ISG20 via NF-kappaB and its antiviral
activity led us to suggest that ISG20 could participate in the cellular response 
to virus infection.

Leishmania donovani induces interferon regulatory factor in murine macrophages: a
host defense response.

Balaraman S(1), Tewary P, Singh VK, Madhubala R.

Author information: 
(1)School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.

Macrophages play a key role in directing the host immune response to infection.
Interaction of Leishmania donovani with macrophages results in the antagonization
of host defense mechanisms by interfering with a cascade of cell signaling
processes in the macrophages. Macrophages secrete interferon (IFN), as well as
other cytokines, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs) comprise a family of DNA-binding proteins that have
been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of IFN and certain
IFN-inducible genes. IRF-1 is a transcription factor, which regulates induction
of several macrophage effectors and is known to bind to IRF-E site in the
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) promoter. We for the first time report
that L. donovani and its surface molecule lipophosphoglycan (LPG) result in a
dose- and time-dependent activation of IRF-DNA-binding activity in macrophages.
The components of this novel LPG-stimulated IRF-like complex are unclear. The
interaction of parasite with the macrophages and not the cellular uptake was
important for IRF activation. The use of inhibitors selective for ERK (PD98059)
and p38 (SB203580) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway showed that
preincubation of cells with either SB203580 or PD98059 did not affect the binding
activity of IRF-E, suggesting that both p38 and ERK MAP kinase activation are not
necessary for IRF-E activation. It is likely that induction of IRF in response to
infection by L. donovani represents a host defense mechanism.

Role of interferon-stimulated responsive element-like element in interleukin-8
promoter in Helicobacter pylori infection.

Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. yyamaoka@bcm.tmc.edu

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastric mucosal interleukin (IL)-8 levels are related to the
presence of both the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) and OipA. We investigated the
regions of the IL-8 promoter and the upstream signaling involved in IL-8 gene
transcription.
METHODS: We cocultured parental Helicobacter pylori and isogenic oipA, hopZ, or
cagE gene knockout mutants with gastric cancer cells. The regulatory sites in the
IL-8 promoter were examined by luciferase reporter gene assay, electrophoretic
mobility shift assays, and immunoblot analyses. Phosphorylated signal transducers
and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) levels in the antral gastric mucosa
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Maximal H. pylori -induced IL-8 gene transcription required the presence
of the interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE)-like element, nuclear
factor (NF)-kappa B and activator protein (AP)-1 binding sites. In vitro studies 
showed that OipA and the cag PAI were involved in inducing interferon regulatory 
factor (IRF)-1 to bind and activate the ISRE-like element and that the cag PAI,
but not OipA, was involved in activating AP-1 and NF-kappa B. Both in vitro and
in vivo studies showed that OipA, but not the cag PAI, was involved in STAT1
phosphorylation, as upstream signaling of IRF-1.
CONCLUSIONS: OipA and the cag PAI are both necessary for full activation of the
IL-8 promoter but act via different pathways that diverge upstream of IRF-1 where
only OipA is involved in the STAT1-IRF1-ISRE pathway. The mucosal inflammatory
response to H. pylori infection is complex and involves different pathways
converging on the IL-8 promoter.

Transcriptional response of T cells to IFN-alpha: changes induced in
IFN-alpha-sensitive and resistant cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

(CNIO), Madrid, Spain.

Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy is commonly used in the treatment of
neoplastic and autoimmune diseases, including cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL).
However, the IFN-alpha response is unpredictable, and the IFN-alpha cell targets 
and pathways are only partially understood. To delineate the molecular mechanisms
of IFN-alpha activity, gene expression profiling was performed in a time-course
experiment of both IFN-alpha sensitive and IFN-alpha-resistant variants of a CTCL
cell line. These experiments revealed that IFN-alpha is responsible for the
regulation of hundreds of genes in both variants and predominantly involves genes
implicated in signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and
transcription regulation. Specifically, the IFN-alpha response of tumoral T cells
is due to a combination of induction of apoptosis in which TNFSF10 and HSXIAPAF1 
may play an important role and cell cycle arrest achieved by downregulation of
CDK4 and CCNG2 and upregulation of CDKN2C and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs).
Resistance to IFN-alpha appears to be associated with failure to induce IRF1 and 
IRF7 and deregulation of the apoptotic signals of HSXIAPAF1, TRADD, BAD, and
BNIP3. Additionally, cell cycle progression is heralded by upregulation of CDC25A
and CDC42. A critical role of NF-kappaB in promoting cell survival in
IFN-alpha-resistant cells is indicated by the upregulation of RELB and LTB.

The up-regulation of human caspase-8 by interferon-gamma in breast tumor cells
requires the induction and action of the transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor-1.

Treatment of human breast tumor cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) elevates 
caspase-8 expression and sensitizes these cells to death receptor-mediated
apoptosis through the increased processing and activation of apical procaspase-8.
We have characterized the human caspase-8 gene promoter and studied the
transcriptional regulation of caspase-8 gene expression in MCF-7 breast tumor
cells treated with IFN-gamma. Our findings show that IFN-gamma induces the
up-regulation of caspase-8 mRNA expression through a protein synthesis-dependent 
mechanism involving the action of the IFN-gamma-inducible transcription factor
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and without altering mRNA stability. The
human caspase-8 gene promoter lacks recognizable TATA and CAAT boxes but contains
a consensus Sp1 binding site. We have identified two major IFN-gamma-inducible
transcriptional start sites in these cells by S1 nuclease mapping, confirmed by
primer extension analysis. Deletion analysis of the promoter defined an 82-bp
minimal region responsible for IFN-gamma-inducible promoter activity. In this
region, we have identified an IFN-stimulated response element that is important
for both the basal and IFN-gamma-enhanced transcriptional activities.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis demonstrated that IFN-gamma induces
a complex between an oligonucleotide probe containing the ISRE motif and IRF-1
over a similar time scale to the induction of caspase-8 mRNA. Exogenously
expressed IRF-1 in MCF-7 cells up-regulated the activity of a luciferase reporter
plasmid containing an 82-bp region of the caspase-8 promoter. These data define a
new pathway through which IFN-gamma might control the sensitivity of tumor cell
to death receptor-mediated apoptosis.

Interferon-gamma-induced inhibition of neuronal vesicular stomatitis virus
infection is STAT1 dependent.

Chesler DA(1), Dodard C, Lee GY, Levy DE, Reiss CS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York 10003, USA.

In this report, the signaling pathways utilized by interferon (IFN)-gamma in
neurons and their respective roles in the inhibition of vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV) replication were studied. The authors have previously shown that
IFN-gamma treatment of NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells results in a 2-log inhibition
of VSV production. This inhibition of VSV replication is dependent both in vitro 
and in vivo on nitric oxide (NO) production by NO synthase (NOS)-1. In NB41A3
neuroblastoma cells, IFN-gamma was found to induce the signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) STAT1 phosphorylation, interferon regulatory
factor (IRF)-1 expression, and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
phosphorylation; MAPK, however, was not required for inhibition of viral
replication. Using olfactory bulb-enriched primary neuronal cultures, the
inhibition of VSV replication was found to be STAT1 dependent, but did not
require IRF-1.

Long-term suppression of tumor growth by TNF requires a Stat1- and IFN regulatory

Tumor cells engineered to secrete TNF were used as a model to examine how
persistently high local concentrations of TNF suppress tumor growth. TNF
secretion had no effect on tumor cell proliferation in vitro but caused a very
impressive growth arrest in vivo that was dependent on both bone marrow- and
non-bone marrow-derived host cells expressing TNFR. Suppression also required an 
endogenous IFN-gamma pathway consisting minimally of IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma
receptor, Stat1, and IFN regulatory factor 1 since mice with targeted disruption 
of any of the four genes failed to arrest tumor growth. The ability of these mice
to suppress tumor growth was restored after they were reconstituted with bone
marrow cells from Wt mice. Interestingly, mice lacking the major
IFN-gamma-inducing cytokines IL-12 and IL-18 or T cells, B cells, and the
majority of NK cells that are potential sources of IFN-gamma nevertheless
inhibited tumor development. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence indicated that 
local release of IFN-gamma was not required to inhibit tumor formation. These
results strongly suggest a novel function for the endogenous IFN-gamma pathway
that without measurable IFN-gamma production or activity affects the ability of
TNF to suppress tumor development.

Posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
offsets transcriptional synergism with IFN-gamma and posttranscriptional
up-regulation by IFN-gamma.

Author information: 
(1)Public Health Research Institute and Public Health Research Institute
Tuberculosis Center, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.

Host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires the cytokine IFN-gamma
and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor that is induced to
high levels by IFN-gamma. Therefore, we chose to study regulation of IRF-1
expression as a model for effects of M. tuberculosis on response to IFN-gamma. We
found that IRF-1 mRNA abundance increased far more than transcription rate in
human monocytic THP-1 cells stimulated by IFN-gamma, but less than transcription 
rate in cells infected by M. tuberculosis. IFN-gamma stimulation of infected
cells caused a synergistic increase in IRF-1 transcription, yet IRF-1 mRNA
abundance was similar in uninfected and infected cells stimulated by IFN-gamma,
as was the IRF-1 protein level. Comparable infection by Mycobacterium bovis
bacillus Calmette-Guérin failed to induce IRF-1 expression and had no effect on
the response to IFN-gamma. We also examined the kinetics of transcription, the
mRNA t(1/2), and the distribution of IRF-1 transcripts among total nuclear RNA,
poly(A) nuclear RNA, and poly(A) cytoplasmic RNA pools in cells that were
infected by M. tuberculosis and/or stimulated by IFN-gamma. Our data suggest that
infection by M. tuberculosis inhibits RNA export from the nucleus. Moreover, the 
results indicate that regulated entry of nascent transcripts into the pool of
total nuclear RNA affects IRF-1 expression and that this process is stimulated by
IFN-gamma and inhibited by M. tuberculosis. The ability of infection by M.
tuberculosis to limit the increase in IRF-1 mRNA expression that typically
follows transcriptional synergism may contribute to the pathogenicity of M.
tuberculosis.

Gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions of p53, p21, and IRF-1
polymorphisms in Korean women with cervix cancer.

Lee JE(1), Lee SJ, Namkoong SE, Um SJ, Sull JW, Jee SH, You YK, Park JS.

Author information: 
(1)DNA Link, College of Medicine, Catholic University, Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify gene-gene and
gene-environmental factors affecting cervix carcinogenesis in Korean women.
METHODS: We evaluated 530 subjects composed of 185 female cervix cancer patients 
and 345 normal healthy women. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of p53
codon 72, p21 codon 31, and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) intron 6 were 
evaluated from extracted DNA of peripheral blood with an automatic DNA sequencer.
The differences of each SNP, gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions
between normal controls and patients were evaluated in the adjusted environmental
background.
RESULTS: In the environmental aspect, the rate of cervix cancer increased in the 
women with a lower level of education, a younger age at first sexual intercourse 
and more childbearing. The women who had p53 (Arg/Arg), IRF-1 (T/T), and <6 years
of education showed a 14.7-fold increased risk of cervix cancer compared to the
women who had p53 ( approximately Pro), IRF-1 ( approximately C), and >15 years
of education. The women who had p53 (Arg/Arg), p21 (Ser/Ser), and >3 children
showed a 6.4-fold increased risk of cervix cancer compared to the women who had
p53 ( approximately Pro), p21 ( approximately Arg), and no children. The women
who had p53 (Arg/Arg), IRF-1 (T/T), and first sexual intercourse before 22 years 
old showed a 5.5-fold increased risk of cervix cancer compared to the women who
had p53 ( approximately Pro), IRF-1 ( approximately C), and first sexual
intercourse after 26 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the level of education, the age at first intercourse, 
and the number of children were independent risk factors in cervix
carcinogenesis. The specific combinations of p53, p21, and IRF-1 gene-gene and
gene-environmental interactions were significantly noted in the cervix
carcinogenesis of Korean women.

IRF-1 expression induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in mouse mammary
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a nuclear transcription factor that
mediates interferon and other cytokine effects and appears to have antitumor
activity in vitro and in vivo in cancer cells. We have constructed a recombinant 
adenoviral vector (Ad-IRF-1) that infects mammary cells with high efficiency and 
results in high levels of functional IRF-1 protein in transfected cells.
Overexpression of IRF-1 in two mouse breast cancer cell lines, C3-L5 and TS/A,
resulted in apoptosis in these cell lines as assessed by Annexin V staining. The 
involvement of caspases was confirmed by significant inhibition of apoptosis by a
caspase inhibitor, and by demonstration of caspase-3 activity, cleavage of
caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. Interestingly, the growth of nonmalignant breast
cell lines C127I and NMuMG did not appear to be inhibited by IRF-1
overexpression. Suppression of growth for breast cancer cell lines in vivo was
demonstrated by both preinfection of breast cancer cells ex vivo and by
intratumoral injection of Ad-IRF-1 into established tumors in their natural
hosts. The mechanism of apoptosis may involve the transcriptional upregulation of
bak, caspase-8, and caspase-7 expression. These data support the antitumor
potential of IRF-1 and the use of agents that increase IRF-1 in breast cancer.

Two forms of human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) are produced in vivo
through alternative mRNA splicing. The two forms, full-length TrpRS and mini
TrpRS, are catalytically active, but are distinguished by the striking
anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity specific to mini TrpRS. Here we
describe two new splice variants of human TrpRS mRNA. Their production was
strongly regulated by gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), an anti-proliferative
cytokine known to stimulate the expression of other anti-angiogenic factors. A
new IFN-gamma-sensitive promoter was demonstrated to drive production of these
splice variants. In human endothelial cells, both the newly discovered and a
previously reported promoter were shown to respond specifically to IFN-gamma and 
not to other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth
factor-beta, interleukin-4 or erythropoietin. In addition, both promoters were
stimulated by the 'downstream' interferon regulatory factor 1 that, in turn, is
known to be regulated by the 'upstream' signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1alpha subunit. Thus, the tandem promoters provide a dual system to
regulate expression and alternative splicing of human TrpRS in vivo.

Innate cellular response to virus particle entry requires IRF3 but not virus
replication.

Ontario, Canada L8N 3Z5.

Mammalian cells respond to virus infections by eliciting both innate and adaptive
immune responses. One of the most effective innate antiviral responses is the
production of alpha/beta interferon and the subsequent induction of
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose products collectively limit virus
replication and spread. Following viral infection, interferon is produced in a
biphasic fashion that involves a number of transcription factors, including the
interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) 1, 3, 7, and 9. In addition, virus infection
has been shown to directly induce ISGs in the absence of prior interferon
production through the activation of IRF3. This process is believed to require
virus replication and results in IRF3 hyperphosphorylation, nuclear localization,
and proteasome-mediated degradation. Previously, we and others demonstrated that 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) induces ISGs and an antiviral response in
fibroblasts in the absence of both interferon production and virus replication.
In this report, we show that the entry of enveloped virus particles from diverse 
virus families elicits a similar innate response. This process requires IRF3, but
not IRF1, IRF7, or IRF9. Following virus replication, the large DNA viruses HSV-1
and vaccinia virus effectively inhibit ISG mRNA accumulation, whereas the small
RNA viruses Newcastle disease virus, Sendai virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus
do not. In addition, we found that IRF3 hyperphosphorylation and degradation do
not correlate with ISG and antiviral state induction but instead serve as a
hallmark of productive virus replication, particularly following a
high-multiplicity infection. Collectively, these data suggest that virus entry
triggers an innate antiviral response mediated by IRF3 and that subsequent virus 
replication results in posttranslational modification of IRF3, such as
hyperphosphorylation, depending on the nature of the incoming virus.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor exhibiting
functional diversity because of its ability to activate transcription from
promoters of several IRF-1-dependent genes. It is a modular protein, where the
overall structure is not essential for function of its individual domains. A
comparison of the mouse and human IRF-1 amino acid sequences enabled us to
identify a stretch of six amino acids (198-203) within the transactivation domain
of mouse IRF-1, 198MQMDII(203) to be different from that of the human IRF-1,
197IPVEVV(202). This indicated a possible functional significance of the six
amino acid stretches in the two IRF-1 molecules. The murine IRF-1 sequence at
198-203 (MQMDII) was replaced by IPVEVV. Recombinant wild type mouse IRF-1 with
198MQMDII(203) and its mutant form with 198IPVEVV(203), expressed as
GST-IRF-1-fusion proteins, showed similar DNA-binding activity. However, ectopic 
expression of the wild type and mutant IRF-1 in the human embryonic kidney
(HEK-293) cells showed the effect of replacement of this region on expression of 
a few chromosomal genes that are transcriptionally activated by IRF-1 viz.
IFN-beta, iNOS, and COX-2 genes. In our study, expression of wild type IRF-1
activated these genes as judged by RT-PCR but the mutant IRF-1 did not show this 
effect. Thus, the MQMDII (198-203 a.a.) region of mouse IRF-1 has a functional
context in relation to expression of IRF-1-inducible genes.

Nuclear factor-kappaB motif and interferon-alpha-stimulated response element
co-operate in the activation of guanylate-binding protein-1 expression by
inflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells.

The large GTPase GBP-1 (guanylate-binding protein-1) is a major IFN-gamma
(interferon-gamma)-induced protein with potent anti-angiogenic activity in
endothelial cells. An ISRE (IFN-alpha-stimulated response element) is necessary
and sufficient for the induction of GBP-1 expression by IFN-gamma. Recently, we
have shown that in vivo GBP-1 expression is strongly endothelial-cell-associated 
and is, in addition to IFN-gamma, also activated by interleukin-1beta and tumour 
necrosis factor-alpha, both in vitro and in vivo [Lubeseder-Martellato, Guenzi,
Jörg, Töpolt, Naschberger, Kremmer, Zietz, Tschachler, Hutzler, Schwemmle et al. 
(2002) Am. J. Pathol. 161, 1749-1759; Guenzi, Töpolt, Cornali,
Lubeseder-Martellato, Jörg, Matzen, Zietz, Kremmer, Nappi, Schwemmle et al.
(2001) EMBO J. 20, 5568-5577]. In the present study, we identified a NF-kappaB
(nuclear factor kappaB)-binding motif that, together with ISRE, is required for
the induction of GBP-1 expression by interleukin-1beta and tumour necrosis
factor-alpha. Deactivation of the NF-kappaB motif reduced the additive effects of
combinations of these cytokines with IFN-gamma by more than 50%. Importantly,
NF-kappaB p50 rather than p65 activated the GBP-1 promoter. The NF-kappaB motif
and ISRE were detected in an almost identical spatial organization, as in the
GBP-1 promoter, in the promoter regions of various inflammation-associated genes.
Therefore both motifs may constitute a cooperative inflammatory cytokine response
module that regulates GBP-1 expression. Our findings may open new perspectives
for the use of NF-kappaB inhibitors to support angiogenesis in inflammatory
diseases including ischaemia.

Regulation of murine Tap1 and Lmp2 genes in macrophages by interferon gamma is
mediated by STAT1 and IRF-1.

The genes of the transporter associated with antigen processing (Tap)-1, and the 
low molecular weight peptide (Lmp)-2, are crucial for class I major
histocompatibility complex function and share a common bidirectional promoter. In
murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) induced
Tap-1 and upregulated Lmp-2, which is constitutively expressed at low levels. The
IFN-gamma-induction was independent of early gene synthesis. The mRNA induced by 
IFN-gamma was very stable. In macrophages from STAT1 knockout mice, IFN-gamma did
not induce the expression of Tap-1 or Lmp-2. Several areas in the promoter can be
controlled by IFN-gamma, such as proximal and distal GAS boxes in the direction
of the Tap-1 gene, NFgammaB and IRF-1 boxes. By making deletions of the promoter,
we found that only the proximal GAS and IRF-1 boxes are required for IFN-gamma
induction of Tap-1 and Lmp-2. Experiments using nuclear extracts from macrophages
treated for 30 min with IFN-gamma and gel shift analysis indicated that STAT1
binds to the GAS box. The nuclear extracts from macrophages treated for at least 
2 h with IFN-gamma bound to the IRF-1 box. These results indicate that both STAT1
and IRF-1 are required for the IFN-gamma induction of Tap-1 and Lmp-2 genes.

5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase induction in C6
astrocytoma cells.

The influence of a nucleoside analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) on
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent nitric oxide (NO) production in 
various rat cell types was investigated. In C6 astrocytoma cell line and primary 
astrocytes, 5-AzadC enhanced proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha,
IL-1)-triggered NO synthesis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast,
5-AzadC did not potentiate NO production in IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages,
fibroblasts, or endothelial cells. Blockade of transcription or translation in C6
cells abolished the observed effect, suggesting the iNOS gene expression, rather 
than its catalytic activity, as a target for the drug action. Accordingly,
5-AzadC upregulated IFN-gamma-induced expression of iNOS mRNA in C6 astrocytes.
The effect of 5-AzadC on astrocyte NO release was blocked by the inhibitor of
p44/42 mitogen activated protein kinase-dependent signaling. Finally, the
observed stimulatory effect of 5-AzadC on iNOS expression was apparently
independent of DNA demethylation, as DNA digestion with methylation-sensitive
restriction enzyme HpaII showed that 5-AzadC failed to demethylate cellular DNA
in conditions used for iNOS induction.

Induction of interferon regulatory factor 1 expression in human dermal
endothelial cells by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha is
transcriptionally regulated and requires iron.

Georgia 30322, USA.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 is a transcription factor that is linked to the
expression of genes important in the initiation of the inflammatory response and 
the control of cell cycle. In this study, we determined that the generation of
interferon regulatory factor-1 expression in human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells was transcriptionally mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha
or interferon-gamma via iron-dependent pathways. The induction of interferon
regulatory factor-1 protein and the up-regulation of interferon regulatory
factor-1 mRNA levels was inhibited when cells were pretreated with the iron
chelators 2-2-dipyridyl or deferoxamine. This inhibition of interferon regulatory
factor-1 expression was associated with loss of interferon regulatory factor-1
binding to the interferon-stimulated response element as assessed by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Addition of exogenous iron with the iron
chelator resulted in reconstitution of cytokine responsiveness, thus
demonstrating iron as the target for the chelator effect. Both tumor necrosis
factor-alpha and interferon-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor-1 gene
transcription, as assessed by the measurement of unspliced, nascent,
heterogeneous nuclear RNA, and treatment with iron chelators blocked tumor
necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma mediated interferon regulatory factor-1
gene transcription. Iron was not essential, however, for the association of
interferon regulatory factor-1 mRNA with polyribosomes, suggesting iron was not
essential for interferon regulatory factor-1 protein translation. Through such
inhibitory regulation on pro-inflammatory transcription factors, iron chelators
may serve as anti-inflammatory agents.

Interferon-gamma induces apoptosis of lens alphaTN4-1 cells and proteasome
inhibition has an antiapoptotic effect.

Awasthi N(1), Wagner BJ.

Author information:

Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07101-1709, USA.

PURPOSE: Targeted ectopic expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the eyes 
of transgenic mice disrupts lens differentiation, upregulates immunoproteasomes, 
and causes cataract. In this study, the hypothesis that IFN-gamma induces
proteasome-dependent apoptosis of lens epithelial cells was tested.
METHOD: Murine lens epithelial alphaTN4-1 cells were treated with IFN-gamma.
Apoptosis was measured using annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining,
and DNA fragmentation. IFN-gamma-inducible mRNA and protein expressions were
measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Caspase activities were measured
using colorimetric substrates and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage.
The effect of proteasome inhibition was tested with MG132 and lactacystin.
RESULTS: IFN-gamma treatment at a concentration that induces immunoproteasome
expression causes an approximately 20% increase in early apoptotic cells as
observed by annexin V-FITC/PI staining and the increase in DNA fragmentation.
IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis was accompanied by upregulation of apoptosis-related 
genes, including a dramatic increase in signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT)-1 and interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP),
a more than 2-fold increase in IRF-1, and a 1.7- to 2-fold increase in caspase-1 
mRNA. Bcl-2 mRNA decreased 2.4- to 3.0-fold, whereas Bax mRNA was unchanged. The 
Bax-to-Bcl-2 protein ratio increased by 1.6-fold. Caspase-1 and -8 activities
were higher, but there was no increase in caspase-3 activity. Proteasome
inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin protected the cells against IFN-gamma-induced
apoptosis. A positive control treatment with staurosporine (STP) caused increased
caspase-3 activity, which was inhibited by MG132.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma causes apoptosis of alphaTN4-1 cells, accompanied by
upregulation of known effectors. IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis involves Bcl-2
family proteins and caspases. Proteasome inhibition has antiapoptotic effects on 
IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis. It also inhibits the STP-induced increase in
caspase-3 activity. If IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis of lens epithelial cells
contributes to cataractogenesis, the proteasome may be a therapeutic target.

Helicobacter pylori disrupts STAT1-mediated gamma interferon-induced signal
transduction in epithelial cells.

Mitchell DJ(1), Huynh HQ, Ceponis PJ, Jones NL, Sherman PM.

Author information: 
(1)Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Infection with Helicobacter pylori is chronic despite a vigorous mucosal immune
response characterized by gastric T-helper type 1 cell expansion and gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) production. IFN-gamma signals by activation and nuclear
translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1);
however, the effect of H. pylori infection on IFN-gamma-STAT1 signaling is
unknown. We infected human gastric (MKN45 and AGS) and laryngeal (HEp-2)
epithelial cell lines with type 1 and type 2 H. pylori strains and then
stimulated them with IFN-gamma. Western blotting of whole-cell protein extracts
revealed that infection with live, but not heat-killed, H. pylori
time-dependently decreased IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear protein extracts demonstrated
that H. pylori infection reduced IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 DNA binding. STAT1 was
unable to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in H. pylori-infected
HEp-2 cells examined by immunofluorescence, and reverse transcription-PCR showed 
that IFN-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor 1 expression was inhibited.
These effects were independent of the cagA, cagE, and VacA status of the
infecting H. pylori strain. Furthermore, neither H. pylori culture supernatants
nor conditioned medium from H. pylori-infected MKN45 cells inhibited
IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that inhibition is
independent of a soluble epithelial or bacterial factor but is dependent on
bacterial contact with epithelial cells. H. pylori disruption of IFN-gamma-STAT1 
signaling in epithelial cells may represent a mechanism by which the bacterium
modifies mucosal immune responses to promote its survival in the human host.

Nuclear factor-kappaB contributes to interleukin-4- and interferon-dependent
polymeric immunoglobulin receptor expression in human intestinal epithelial
cells.

Veterans Affairs Medical Center and The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52246, 
USA.

Polymeric immunoglobulins (pIgs) that are present at mucosal surfaces play key
roles in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. These pIgs are delivered 
to the mucosal surface via transcytosis across the epithelium, a process mediated
by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). Previous studies demonstrate
that expression of the pIgR is regulated by multiple immunomodulatory factors
including interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In studies using
human intestinal epithelial cells (HT29), multiple inhibitors of the
transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), including a dominant
negative IkappaBalpha-serine mutant, inhibited both IL-4- and IFN-dependent
increases in pIgR expression. Under identical conditions, NF-kappaB inhibitors
had no effect on cytokine-dependent increases in expression of the transcription 
factor interferon regulatory factor-1. Over-expression of the IkappaBalpha-serine
mutant also inhibited reporter gene expression in response to IL-4, TNF-alpha,
IL-1beta, and in some cases IFN-gamma using constructs with sequences from the
pIgR promoter. Reduced levels of pIgR were observed even when inhibitors were
added >/=24 hr after cytokines suggesting that prolonged activation of NF-kappaB 
is required. Finally, reporter gene studies with NF-kappaB enhancer elements
indicated that IFN-gamma alone and IL-4 in combination with other cytokines
activated NF-kappaB in HT29 cells. Together, these studies provide additional
insight into the signalling pathways that contribute to expression of the pIgR, a
critical player in mucosal immunity.

Celiac disease (CD) is a common gastro-intestinal disorder resulting from
permanent intolerance to wheat gliadins and related proteins in rye and barley.
In addition to the strong genetic association with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, a genetic
region on chromosomes 5 (CELIAC2) has been identified that harbours a
susceptibility gene for CD. The gene(s) responsible for this association,
however, remains to be identified. In the present study we evaluated
polymorphisms in the genes encoding interleukin-12 p40 (IL12B) and interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Both genes are located in the celiac2 region, and
have key roles in inducing interferon (IFN)-gamma secreting T helper 1 (Th1)
cells, one of the immunological hallmarks of CD. The frequencies of a TaqI gene
polymorphism in the 3' UTR of IL12B and a HinfI gene polymorphism in the 3' UTR
of IRF1 were studied in 258 Dutch CD patients and 237 ethnically matched healthy 
controls. The transmission of the polymorphic variants from parents to affected
child was determined in 123 families with at least one affected child. The
frequencies of the IL12B TaqI gene polymorphism and the IRF1 HinfI gene
polymorphism did not differ significantly between patients and controls. In
addition, in the family study, no deviation from the expected transmission from
parents to affected child of any of the polymorphic variants was found. The IL12B
TaqI and the IRF1 HinfI gene polymorphisms do not appear to be involved in
susceptibility to CD. Further studies on the factors that drive the Th1
immunopathology in CD are required.

Arsenic enhances the activation of Stat1 by interferon gamma leading to
synergistic expression of IRF-1.

Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) can induce clinical remission in patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), including those who have relapsed after treatment
with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). In vitro studies with the APL-derived NB4 cell
line showed that As2O3 exerts a dose-dependent dual effect, which induces
apoptosis at 1 microM, whereas at a lower concentration of 0.1 microM, a partial 
differentiation of APL is observed. In non-APL cells, interferon (IFN) alpha and 
1 microM As2O3 act synergistically to induce apoptosis. In this report, we show
that in NB4 cells and in two RA-resistant NB4-derived cell lines, NB4-R1 and
NB4-R2, IFNalpha or IFNgamma combined with 0.1 microM As2O3 lead to an increased 
maturation effect. Moreover, IFNgamma alone is able to differentiate RA-sensitive
and -resistant cells with a higher maturation effect on NB4-R2 cells. In
contrast, all these cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of the cytokine and
a higher concentration of As2O3. IFNgamma boosted As2O3-induced apoptosis in APL 
cells as tested by TUNEL, Annexin V staining and activation of caspase 3. As2O3
differently altered IFN-induced gene products; it downregulated PML/RARalpha and 
PML, did not alter PKR and Stat1, and upregulated interferon regulatory family
(IRF)-1. Synergism by IFNgamma and arsenic on IRF-1 expression is mediated by a
composite element in the IRF-1 promoter that includes an IFNgamma-activation site
(GAS) overlapped by a nonconsensus site for nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB).
Arsenic has no effect on NFkappaB, whereas it enhances the activation of Stat1 by
IFNgamma in NB4 cells leading to an increase in IRF-1 expression.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 mediates PPARgamma-induced apoptosis in vascular
smooth muscle cells.

Drive SW, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) possesses
general beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, such as inhibition of
vascular lesion formation and atherosclerosis. However, molecular mechanisms for 
these effects are yet to be fully defined. The aim of this study is to elucidate 
whether interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional factor with
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, mediates PPARgamma-induced
apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Northern and Western blot analyses, we documented that
PPARgamma ligands, including ciglitazone, troglitazone, and GW7845, significantly
increased IRF-1 expression in VSMCs; however, the PPARalpha ligand (Wy14643) and 
PPARdelta ligand (GW0742) did not affect its expression. PPARgamma-induced IRF-1 
expression was abrogated by pretreatment with the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. In
contrast, adenoviral expression of PPARgamma in VSMCs dramatically increased
IRF-1 level. Furthermore, PPARgamma activation increased IRF-1 promoter activity 
but did not affect IRF-1 mRNA stability. Finally, reducing IRF-1 expression by
antisense technology attenuated PPARgamma-induced VSMC apoptosis through
decreasing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(cip1) and caspase-3 activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that IRF-1 is a novel PPARgamma target gene and
mediates PPARgamma-induced VSMC apoptosis.

mouse fibroblasts.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that has
been historically associated with type I IFN activation and antioncogenic
properties. We studied IRF-1 expression and DNA-binding capacity in
nontransformed and transformed mouse fibroblasts. A 43-kDa nuclear IRF-1 protein 
was expressed biphasically during the cell cycle in primary mouse embryo
fibroblasts, nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells, and ras revertants. IRF-1 expression
became constitutive in ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and in cells transformed by 
oncogenes ets, fes, fos, her-2/neu, met, mos, raf, or trk, suggesting that
deregulated IRF-1 expression may be associated with loss of growth control. Lysyl
oxidase (LO), a ras suppressor that is downregulated in ras transformants, is an 
IRF-1 target gene, but it is not stimulated by abundant IRF-1 present in
transformants, while another IRF-1 target gene (iNOS) is transcribed. IRF-1 from 
either normal or ras-transformed cells bound to IRF elements in the IFN-beta and 
LO promoters. IRF-1 in transformants can, therefore, bind to but not
transactivate the LO promoter, and the presence of IRF-1 is not sufficient to
suppress ras transformation. LO expression may effect the regulated expression of
IRF-1: a ras revertant, which was generated by stable transfection of LO cDNA,
regained the normal biphasic IRF-1 pattern. A mainly cytoplasmic, constitutively 
expressed 46-kDa protein with immunologic identity to the 43-kDa nuclear IRF-1
was also present in normal and transformed cells, but as it did not bind to the
IRF elements, its function is unclear.

Localization of IFN-gamma-activated Stat1 and IFN regulatory factors 1 and 2 in
breast cancer cells.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the induction and localization of
Stat1, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and IRF-2 after IFN-gamma
exposure of human breast cancer cell lines, SKBR3, MDA468, MCF7, and BT20.
Results from growth assays, Western staining, electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA), and immunohistochemical staining were collated to test our
hypothesis that immunohistochemical analysis of Stat1, IRF-1, and IRF-2 would
provide additional information about the functionality of the IFN-gamma signaling
pathway in human tumor lines. EMSA results showed that in each of four cell
lines, Stat1 expression was increased and demonstrated functional activity after 
IFN-gamma stimulation. Western and EMSA analysis showed upregulation of IRF-1 but
not IRF-2 in each cell line. Confocal microscopy of cells stained for Stat1,
IRF-1, and IRF-2 confirmed the results and also provided novel information about 
the intracellular localization of proteins and intercellular variations in
responses. The proportion of cells with IRF-1 stimulation and translocation was
positively correlated with the IFN-gamma growth suppression in vitro. In
conclusion, using four independent assays, we have demonstrated that
heterogeneity in IFN-gamma-mediated upregulation of signal transduction proteins 
can be detected in vitro and that these differences can explain distinct cellular
growth effects.

A key pathogenic role for the STAT1/T-bet signaling pathway in T-cell-mediated
liver inflammation.

Universität, Mainz, Germany.

TH1 cytokines have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of
T-cell-mediated liver injury and inflammation. However, the molecular signaling
pathways involved in such injury are still poorly understood. In the present
study, we investigated the role of the STAT1/T-bet signaling pathway in a murine 
model of T-cell-mediated liver inflammation induced by the application of
concanavalin A (Con A) using newly created STAT1 transgenic mice as well as
STAT1- and T-bet-deficient mice. Liver injury induced by Con A was associated
with an increase of both pSTAT1 and T-bet levels in the liver. Furthermore,
functional studies suggested a pathogenic role for STAT1 in Con A-induced liver
injury, because transgenic mice overexpressing STAT1 under the control of the CD2
promoter/enhancer construct showed elevated interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and
IRF-1 levels as well as significantly augmented liver injury following
administration of Con A. Consistently, we observed that both STAT1-deficient and 
T-bet-deficient mice were protected from such T-cell-dependent liver injury. In
conclusion, these findings suggest a key pathogenic role for the STAT1/T-bet
signaling pathway for T-cell activation in the Con A model of T-cell-mediated
liver pathology.

The resurgence in mycobacterial infection worldwide has led to renewed attention 
to the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium species. Although interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma) is a principal mediator of macrophage activation, macrophages
infected with Mycobacterium are poor in response at the cytokine. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying mycobacterial infection remain unclear. The
purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the poor response to
IFN-gamma in mycobacterial infection. Our data clearly demonstrate that this is
due to induction of suppressor of cytokine signal (SOCS) negative regulators of
IFN-gamma signal transduction that closely correlates with the inhibition of
JAK/STAT signaling and gene expression stimulated by IFN-gamma. Mycobacterium
bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin infection induces the production of SOCS-1 and
SOCS-3 in murine J774 macrophages. The level of SOCS-1 mRNA increased 1 h and
reached a maximum 3 h after the addition of the bacteria. SOCS-3 mRNA expression 
appeared as early as 1 h after the infection. We also observed that trehalose
6,6'-dimycolate/cord factor, a major component of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
cell wall, induces expression of SOCS and inhibits IFN-gamma-stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT1 extensively in the cells. The results in this study
suggest that a molecular mechanism of mycobacterial infection affects the
unresponsiveness to IFN-gamma in the subsequent growth and spread of macrophages.

Macrophages (M phi) are activated by IFN gamma and are important cellular targets
for infection by human and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), making it advantageous 
for CMVs to block IFN gamma-induced M phi differentiation. We found that MCMV
infection inhibited IFN gamma regulation of many genes in M phi. MCMV infection
blocked IFN gamma responses at the level of transcription without blocking Janus 
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway activation and
targeted IFN response factor 1- and class II transactivator-dependent and
independent promoters. MCMV did not alter basal transcription from IFN
gamma-responsive promoters and left the majority of cellular transcripts
unchanged even after 48 h of infection. The effects of MCMV infection were
specific to chromosomal rather than transiently transfected promoters.
Characterization of the IFN gamma-responsive chromosomal class II transactivator 
promoter revealed that MCMV infection blocked IFN gamma-induced promoter
assembly, allowing the virus to transcriptionally paralyze infected M phi
responses while allowing basal transcription to proceed.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the expression of interferon
regulatory factors 1 (IRF-1) in human uterine endometrial carcinoma.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, archival tissue specimens from 76
human endometrial carcinomas and stained with polyclonal anti-IRF-1 antibody,
using immunohistochemistry, localization, and immunostaining, were evaluated
quantitatively using the H score together with 30 normal endometrium and 16
postmenopausal endometrium.
RESULTS: The expression of IRF-1 was highest in normal endometrium, and decreased
with the grade of endometrioid adenocarcinoma from grade 1 to grade 3.
Postmenopausal endometrium was virtually unstained.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of IRF-1 is altered in human endometrioid adenocarcinoma 
compared with normal endometrium and postmenopausal endometrium. The loss of
IRF-1 expression does not contradict with the tumor-suppressor function. The
intensity of IRF-1 expression in each grade of endometrioid adenocarcinoma could 
be useful prognostic and therapeutic indicators.

The HLA class II expression is controlled by the transcriptional activator CIITA.
The transcription of CIITA is controlled by different promoters, among which
promoter-IV is inducible by IFN-gamma. We analysed the regulation of HLA class II
molecules by IFN-gamma in a large series of human neuroblastoma cell lines. No
induction of surface or intracellular HLA class II molecules and of specific mRNA
was observed, in all neuroblastomas, with the exception of a nonprototypic cell
line, ACN. In a large subset of neuroblastomas IFN-gamma induced expression of
CIITA mRNA, derived from promoter-IV, which was not methylated. In contrast, in
another subset of neuroblastomas, CIITA was not inducible by IFN-gamma and CIITA 
promoter-IV was either completely or partially methylated. Interestingly, the use
of DNA demethylating agents restored CIITA gene transcriptional activation by
IFN-gamma, but not HLA class II expression. The defect of HLA class II was not
related to alterations in RFX or NF-Y transcription factors, as suggested by EMSA
or RFX gene transfection experiments. In addition, the transfection of a
functional CIITA cDNA failed to induce HLA class II expression in typical
neuroblastoma cells. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis suggested a
defective nuclear translocation and/or reduced protein synthesis in
CIITA-transfected NB cells. Altogether, these data point to multiple mechanisms
preventing HLA class II expression in the neuroblastoma, either involving CIITA
promoter-IV silencing, or acting at the CIITA post-transcriptional level.

IFN-alpha and IL-12 are macrophage-derived cytokines that enhance innate and Th1 
immune responses. However, there is little information regarding IFN-alpha and
IL-12 target genes that would be involved in mediating the immunostimulatory
effects of these cytokines. The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of
transcription factors is known to be involved in controlling lymphocyte
differentiation and functions. In this work we have studied the effect of
IFN-alpha and IL-12 on the expression of IRF transcription factors in human NK
and T cells. Both IFN-alpha and IL-12 strongly up-regulated IRF-1, IRF-4, and
IRF-8 mRNA and protein expression. The binding of IRF-4 and IRF-8 to the lambdaB 
gene enhancer sequence was also increased following IFN-alpha- and
IL-12-treatment of NK and T cells. A GAS element from the promoter region of the 
IRF-4 gene was identified. Following stimulation of cells with IFN-alpha or
IL-12, Stat4 was found to bind to this IRF-4 GAS element, as detected by EMSA and
DNA affinity binding, implying that the IRF-4 gene is directly activated by both 
cytokines. Our results suggest that IFN-alpha and IL-12 may enhance innate and
Th1 immune responses by inducing IRF-1, IRF-4, and IRF-8 gene expression.

Genome-wide scans for DNA and RNA changes in the HL-60 cell line relative to
normal leukocytes were conducted. Microarray-based comparative genome
hybridization (CGH) studies were performed with the Spectral Genomics Human
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) 3MB system. Transcriptional measurements of
approximately 12,500 human genes were monitored using Affymetrix U95A GeneChips. 
In HL-60, genomic DNA amplification of the 8q24 locus, trisomy 18, and deletions 
at loci 5q11.2 approximately q31, 6q12, 9p21.3 approximately p22, 10p12
approximately p15, 14q22 approximately q31, 17p12 approximately p13.3, and
monosomy X were detected. After obtaining locus information about the RNA
transcripts from the Affymetrix database, 4368 genes were stratified both
according to status of RNA expression and the DNA copy number of their designated
loci. The expression level of 2326 (53.25%) of 4368 transcripts is concordant
with DNA copy number. Examples of specific, highly expressed, cancer-associated
genes in amplified loci include SERPINB10, MYC, TYMS, HEC, and EPB41L3, while
CD14, GZMK, TCF7, FOS, MLH3, CTNNA1, IRF1, VIM, CRK, MAP3K1, STAM, MAX, SFRG5,
ENC1, PURA, MNT, RASA1, GLRX, UBE2B, NR3C1, PTENP1, BS69, COPEB, SKIP, PIM2, and 
MIC2 represent cancer-associated genes in deleted loci with decreased expression.
The complementary usage of genome-wide DNA and RNA scans should enhance the
identification of candidate genes in the neoplastic process.

Reactive oxygen species mediate virus-induced STAT activation: role of tyrosine
phosphatases.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of epidemic respiratory
tract illness in children in the United States and worldwide. RSV infection of
airway epithelial cells induces formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose
production mediates the expression of cytokines and chemokines involved the
immune/inflammatory responses of the lung. In this study, we have investigated
the role of ROS in RSV-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STAT) activation and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) gene expression in human
airway epithelial cells. Our results indicate that RSV replication induces IRF-1 
and -7 gene transcription, a response abrogated by antioxidants. RSV infection
induces binding of STAT to the IRF-1 gamma-interferon-activated sequence (GAS)
and IRF-7 interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE). STAT1 and STAT3 bind
IRF-1 GAS, whereas STAT1, STAT2, IRF-1, and IRF-9 bind IRF-7 ISRE. Antioxidant
treatment blocks RSV-induced STAT binding to both the IRF-1 GAS and IRF-7 ISRE by
inhibition of inducible STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that
RSV-induced ROS formation is required for STAT activation and IRF gene
expression. Although protein tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for
RSV-induced STAT activation, Janus kinase and Src kinase activation do not
mediate this effect. Instead, RSV infection inhibits intracellular tyrosine
phosphatase activity, which is restored by antioxidant treatment. Pharmacological
inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases induces STAT activation. Together, these
results suggest that modulation of phosphatases could be an important mechanism
of virus-induced STAT activation. Treatment of alveolar epithelial cells with the
NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium abolishes RSV-induced STAT
activation, indicating that NAD(P)H oxidase-produced ROS are required for
downstream activation of the transcription factors IRF and STAT in virus-infected
airway epithelial cells.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder
caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the gene product,
ataxin-3. We have previously shown that mutant ataxin-3 causes upregulation of
inflammatory genes in transgenic SCA3 cell lines and human SCA3 pontine neurons. 
We report here a complex pattern of transcriptional changes by microarray gene
expression profiling and Northern blot analysis in a SCA3 cell model.
Twenty-three differentially expressed genes involved in inflammatory reactions,
nuclear transcription, and cell surface-associated processes were identified. The
identified corresponding proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in human 
disease and control brain tissue to evaluate their implication in SCA3
pathogenesis. In addition to several inflammatory mediators upregulated in mutant
ataxin-3 expressing cell lines and pontine neurons of SCA3 patients, we
identified a profound repression of genes encoding cell surface-associated
proteins in cells overexpressing normal ataxin-3. Correspondingly, these genes
were upregulated in mutant ataxin-3 expressing cell lines and in pontine neurons 
of SCA3 patients. These findings identify for the first time target genes
transcriptionally regulated by normal ataxin-3 and support the hypothesis that
both loss of normal ataxin-3 and gain of function through protein-protein
interacting properties of mutant ataxin-3 contribute to SCA3 pathogenesis.

Comment in
    J Am Soc Nephrol. 2003 Nov;14(11):2990-1.

Expression of class II transactivator (CIITA), the transcriptional regulator that
controls all class II expression, is controlled in cell lines in vitro by three
promoters: the dendritic cell promoter PI, the B cell promoter PIII, and the
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible promoter, PIV. The authors examined the
promoter usage in vivo in mouse kidney in the basal state and in response to
IFN-gamma, endotoxin, allostimulation, and renal injury. Genetically modified
mice were used to examine the dependency of each promoter on IFN-gamma and on the
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1). Usage of distinct
CIITA promoters was monitored by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) using the unique sequences in the 5' end of the transcript from
each promoter. Kidneys in both control mice and IFN-gamma knockouts expressed
chiefly PI- and PIV-related products. Administration of recombinant IFN-gamma
activated only promoter PIV. Endotoxin or allogeneic stimulation elevated the
PIV-related mRNA, dependent on IFN-gamma and on IRF-1. Ischemic renal injury,
however, increased the PI- and PIV-driven mRNA expression in wild-type but also
in IFN-gamma-deficient mice. Thus the in vivo control of CIITA promoters in
kidney is similar to that observed in vitro (i.e., basal-state usage of PI and
IFN-gamma-dependent usage of PIV during inflammation), but it also shows
additional levels of control: IFN-gamma-independent basal activity of PIV and
IFN-gamma-independent induction of PIV during tissue injury.

Differential regulation of interleukin (IL)-12 p35 and p40 gene expression and
interferon (IFN)-gamma-primed IL-12 production by IFN regulatory factor 1.

Liu J(1), Cao S, Herman LM, Ma X.

Author information:

University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.

Interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of the p40 and p35
chains encoded on separate chromosomes. Coordinated expression of the two
constituent genes is crucial for appropriate immune responses in timing,
location, and magnitude. Interferon (IFN)-gamma priming of IL-12 production by
macrophages represents an important physiological process in vivo for escalated
cellular response to microbial infections. We provide evidence that IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)-1-deficient macrophages have a selective impairment in
mRNA synthesis of IL-12 p35 but not the p40 gene, and a strong deficiency in the 
production of IL-12 p70 but not p40. We demonstrate that the levels of IL-12 p35 
protein stimulated by IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correspond to those 
of its mRNA, and that the nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway is essential
for the induction of IL-12 p35 transcription by LPS. IRF-1 plays a major role in 
the transcriptional activation of the IL-12 p35 gene, but not of the p40 gene, by
physically interacting with an inverted IRF element within the IL-12 p35 promoter
upon IFN-gamma activation. Moreover, IRF-1-mediated transcriptional activation of
the p35 promoter requires the cooperation of two adjacent Sp1 elements. Thus,
IRF-1 acts as a critical component of IFN-gamma signaling in the selective
activation of IL-12 p35 transcription in synergy with LPS-mediated events.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 play opposing roles in the
regulation of many IFN-gamma-inducible genes. To investigate the signal
transduction pathway in response to IFN-gamma in light of differences in growth
effects, we selected four human breast carcinoma cell lines based on a spectrum
of growth inhibition by IFN-gamma. MDA468 growth was markedly inhibited by
IFN-gamma, and it showed substantial induction of IRF-1 mRNA but little IRF-2
induction. SKBR3 showed little growth inhibition and little induction of IRF-1
mRNA but significant induction of IRF-2 mRNA. HS578T and MDA436 growth inhibition
and IRF-1/IRF-2 induction were intermediate. All four cell lines showed intact
receptor at the cell surface and Stat1 translocation to the nucleus by
immunostaining. By EMSA, there were marked differences in the induced ratio of
IRF-1 and IRF-2 binding activity between the cell lines that correlated with
growth inhibition. Finally, antisense oligonucleotides specific for IRF-1
attenuated IFN-gamma growth inhibition in MDA436 and MDA468, confirming the
direct role of IRF-1 in IFN-gamma growth inhibition. Induction of IRF-1 causes
growth inhibition in human breast cancer cell lines, and induction of IRF-2 can
oppose this. The relative induction of IRF-1 to IRF-2 is a critical control point
in IFN-gamma response.

This report demonstrates that in addition to interferons and cytokines, members
of the TGF beta superfamily such as Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) and
activin A also regulate IRF-1 expression. MIS induced IRF-1 expression in the
mammary glands of mice in vivo and in breast cancer cells in vitro and
stimulation of IRF-1 by MIS was dependent on activation of the NF kappa B
pathway. In the rat mammary gland, IRF-1 expression gradually decreased during
pregnancy and lactation but increased at involution. In breast cancer, the IRF-1 
protein was absent in 13% of tumors tested compared with matched normal glands.
Consistent with its growth suppressive activity, expression of IRF-1 in breast
cancer cells induced apoptosis. Treatment of breast cancer cells with MIS and
interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) co-stimulated IRF-1 and CEACAM1 expression and
synergistic induction of CEACAM1 by a combination of MIS and IFN-gamma was
impaired by antisense IRF-1 expression. Furthermore, a combination of IFN-gamma
and MIS inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells to a greater extent than
either one alone. Both reagents alone significantly decreased the fraction of
cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, an effect not enhanced when they were
used in combination. However, MIS promoted IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis
demonstrating a functional interaction between these two classes of signaling
molecules in regulation of breast cancer cell growth.

Erratum in

Previous studies based on pharmacological evidence suggested a requirement for
protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the regulation of IFN-gamma-induced MHC class 
II (MHC-II) expression. In the present study, we investigated the molecular
mechanisms by which PKC-alpha modulates IFN-gamma-induced MHC-II expression in
the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Overexpression of a dominant-negative
(DN) mutant of PKC-alpha inhibited the expression of IFN-gamma-induced MHC-II but
had no effect on IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 nuclear translocation and DNA binding
activity, as well as on the expression of inducible NO synthase, IFN consensus
sequence binding protein, MHC class I, IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1, and
IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10. Further analysis showed that IFN-gamma-induced
expression of the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), a transcriptional
coactivator essential for MHC-II expression, was inhibited in DN
PKC-alpha-overexpressing cells. Studies with reporter constructs containing the
promoter IV region of CIITA revealed that overexpression of a constitutively
active mutant of PKC-alpha enhanced IRF-1, but not IRF-2, transcriptional
activity. Furthermore, characterization of IRF-1 from both normal and DN
PKC-alpha-overexpressing cells revealed differences in IRF-1 posttranslational
modifications. Collectively, our data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for
IFN-gamma-induced MHC-II expression, whereby PKC regulates CIITA expression by
selectively modulating the transcriptional activity of IRF-1.

Activation of src-family tyrosine kinases by LPS regulates cytokine production in
dendritic cells by controlling AP-1 formation.

Author information: 
(1)Chiron Vaccines, Siena, Italy.

The role of src-family tyrosine kinases in LPS-induced DC maturation has not been
fully addressed. We show that LPS induces activation of c-Src and Lyn in human
DC. Inhibition of these kinasesby PP1 uncoupled LPS-induced cytokine production
from the up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, resulting in DC still capable 
of stimulating T cell proliferation but much less efficient in inducing Th1
differentiation. This is the first example of a pharmacological inhibitor able to
modulate the capacity of DC to induce a particular type of immune response.
Inhibition of src-family kinases impaired phosphorylation and accumulation of
c-Jun, leading to reduced formation of AP-1 complexes upon LPS stimulation. Thus,
src-kinases control cytokine production in LPS-induced DC maturation through a
timely formation of AP-1.

Production of nitric oxide (NO) in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
was investigated using cultures of mouse peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) and the
macrophage cell line RAW264.7. In the presence of anti-(interferon-gamma)
(IFN-gamma), NO production was markedly suppressed in the PEC culture but not in 
the RAW264.7 culture. In the PEC culture, LPS induced both IFN-gamma production
and activation of IFN response factor-1, which leads to the gene expression of
inducible NO synthase, but neither was induced in the culture of RAW264.7 cells. 
In addition to anti-(IFN-gamma), antibodies against interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18
showed a suppressive effect on LPS-induced NO production in the PEC culture, and 
these antibodies in synergy showed strong suppression. Stimulation of the PEC
culture with IL-12 or IL-18 induced production of IFN-gamma and NO, and these
cytokines, in combination, exhibited marked synergism. Stimulation of the culture
with IFN-gamma induced production of NO, but not IL-12. The macrophage population
in the PEC, prepared as adherent cells, responded well to LPS for IL-12
production, but weakly for production of IFN-gamma and NO. The macrophages also
responded well to IFN-gamma for NO production. For production of IFN-gamma by
stimulation with LPS or IL-12 + IL-18, nonadherent cells were required in the PEC
culture. Considering these results overall, the indirect pathway, through the
production of intermediates (such as IFN-gamma-inducing cytokines and IFN-gamma) 
by the cooperation of macrophages with nonadherent cells, was revealed to play
the main role in the LPS-induced NO production pathway, as opposed to the direct 
pathway requiring only a macrophage population.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and growth-promoting mediator
that is involved in the maintenance of vascular tone within the healthy
circulation. However, a pathogenic role has been implicated by its overproduction
in a number of cardiovascular diseases, which include pulmonary hypertension,
congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, and coronary vasospasm. ET-1 mRNA
expression and peptide production in human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs) 
are markedly increased by exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha and
interferon-gamma. The intracellular signaling mechanism involved in this pathway 
is not known. Because the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-kappaB), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) often mediate the effects of cytokines in 
target cells the aim of this study was to determine whether the production of
ET-1 after exposure of HVSMCs to cytokines depends upon synergism between
NF-kappaB and STAT1/IRF-1. Immunoblotting showed that cytokine-stimulation of
ET-1 release in VSMCs involves nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and STAT1.
Cytokines also induced an increase in IRF-1 protein expression. Antisense
oligonucleotides to NF-kappaB, STAT1, and IRF-1 significantly inhibited cytokine 
induced ET-1 release. In conclusion, NF-kappaB, STAT1, and IRF-1 activation are
involved in the stimulation by cytokines of ET-1 release from HVSMCs. However,
nuclear run-on assays would provide definitive proof that ET-1 is regulated
transcriptionally by cytokines. Because up-regulated production of ET-1 within
VSMCs may underlie the causative role of ET-1 in a number of disease states, this
finding indicates that NF-kappaB, STAT1, and IRF-1 within HVSMCs could be central
to a number of vascular pathologies and that inhibition of this pathway could be 
of therapeutic benefit.

Human lymphomas continue to represent a major challenge in oncology, and in
particular occur at very high frequencies in AIDS patients. We report here the
development of a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disease in mice lacking the
proapoptotic transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor-1. These mice
most closely represent a model of human anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).
This mouse model of lymphoma will likely be useful in understanding the
development of ALCL and in understanding the development of other closely related
CD30+ forms of lymphoma, such as CD30+ Hodgkin's disease and CD30+ cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma. This mouse model will also be useful in testing therapies for
different forms of CD30+ lymphoma, in particular anti-CD30-based therapies.

Synergistic transcriptional activation of indoleamine dioxygenase by IFN-gamma
and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

Robinson CM(1), Shirey KA, Carlin JM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity
inhibits the growth of susceptible intracellular pathogens by catalyzing the
oxidative cleavage of the indole ring of L-tryptophan and depleting pools of the 
essential amino acid. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synergistically
enhances the IDO activity induced by IFN-gamma at the level of transcription in
human epithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to characterize the
molecular mechanisms responsible for synergistic gene expression in response to
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. It was found that IFN-gamma-induced mechanisms, such as 
the binding of Stat1 to gamma activation sequences (GAS) and IFN regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1) to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), are more highly
activated following treatment with IFN and TNF-alpha. This enhanced signal
transduction may be due to the increase in IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR) expression 
following combined cytokine stimulation and is a likely contributor to the
synergy. Additionally, the contribution of a third previously uncharacterized GAS
element that forms a complex with Stat1 was investigated using a plasmid reporter
system that controls for copy number. When the GAS-3 sequence was included in the
regulatory region, gene expression was significantly increased relative to a
region containing the mutated GAS-3. This suggests that GAS-3 is
transcriptionally active and contributes to IFN-gamma-induced regulation of the
IDO gene.

Human cytomegalovirus UL83-coded pp65 virion protein inhibits antiviral gene
expression in infected cells.

Browne EP(1), Shenk T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ
08544-1014, USA.

The initial interaction of human cytomegalovirus with fibroblasts triggers, and
then partially blocks, an innate immune response pathway that leads to the
induction of IFN-responsive genes and proinflammatory chemokines. Infection of
fibroblasts with human cytomegalovirus inhibited their ability to respond to
exogenous IFN. Consistent with the observation that the block did not depend on
de novo viral protein synthesis, ectopic expression of the viral UL83-coded pp65,
an abundant virion protein, inhibited IFN signaling. Furthermore, DNA array
analysis showed that infection with a pp65-deficient mutant virus caused a much
stronger induction of many IFN-response and proinflammatory chemokine RNAs than
infection with wild-type virus. The nuclear DNA-binding activities of
transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF1 were induced to a much greater extent
after infection with the pp65-deficient mutant than with wild-type virus.
IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 DNA-binding was modestly enhanced, whereas IRF3
activity was not affected by mutation of pp65. Together, these results imply that
pp65, which is delivered to newly infected cells in the virion, antagonizes a
pathway that affects NF-kappaB and IRF1 and prevents the accumulation of mRNAs
encoded by numerous cellular antiviral genes.

Assessment of requirements for IL-15 and IFN regulatory factors in uterine NK
cell differentiation and function during pregnancy.

In mouse and human, precursors of NK cell lineage home to decidualizing uteri. To
assess the requirement for IL-15, an essential cytokine for NK differentiation in
lymphoid tissue, on uterine NK (uNK) cell differentiation, implantation sites
from IL-15(-/-) mice were analyzed histologically. IL-15(-/-) implantation sites 
had no uNK cells, no spiral-artery modification, and lacked the decidual
integrity found in normal mice. IL-15(-/-) recipients of C57BL/6 marrow displayed
similar pathology. However, implantation sites from recombination-activating
gene-2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) (alymphoid) recipients of IL-15(-/-) marrow showed
normal uNK cells, modified spiral arteries, and well-developed decidua basalis.
Deletion of the IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)-1, but not IRF-2 (factors important
in peripheral NK cell differentiation) limited but did not prevent uNK cell
development. In situ hybridization localized IRF-1 largely to placental
trophoblast cells. IRF-1(-/-) marrow transplanted into recombination-activating
gene-2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) displayed competence for full uNK cell differentiation. 
IL-15 mRNA expression at implantation sites of IRF-1(-/-) and C57BL/6 was
similar, suggesting that, unlike in bone marrow and spleen, IRF-1 does not
regulate IL-15 in the pregnant uterus. Terminal differentiation of uNK cells was 
not promoted in pregnant IRF-1(-/-) mice by 5-day infusion of murine rIL-15,
suggesting that IRF-1 deficiency rather than IL-15 deficiency limits uNK cell
differentiation in these mice. Further, IRF-1 regulates placental growth, birth
weight, and postnatal growth of offspring. These studies indicate that uNK cell
development and maturation share some aspects with NK cell development in other
tissues, but also display distinctive tissue-specific regulation.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 down-regulates cytokine-induced IP-10 expression
in pancreatic islets.

Baker MS(1), Chen X, Rotramel AR, Nelson JJ, Kaufman DB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Division of Organ Transplantation, Feinberg School of
Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.

BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN)-gamma acts synergistically with interleukin
(IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha to activate isoform of nitric
oxide synthetase (iNOS) gene expression, induce apoptosis, and impair
glucose-stimulated insulin release (GSIR) in pancreatic islets. This effect is an
important mechanism of islet dysfunction in models of pancreatitis, type I
diabetes, and islet allograft rejection. We tested the hypothesis that
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 plays a regulatory role
in both this cytokine-induced islet injury and cytokine-induced gene expression
for chemotactic chemokines.
METHODS: Isolated islets from wild-type (WT) or IRF-1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice were
cultured in a mixture of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma +/- the iNOS
inhibitor L-NMMA. The following end points were assessed: i) GSIR; ii) rates of
apoptosis; and iii) gene expression for iNOS, IRF-1 and inducible protein
(IP)-10, monocyte chemoattractive protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory
protein-1alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta.
RESULTS: Cytokine-treated WT islets demonstrated an increase in IRF-1 and iNOS
gene expression, inhibition of GSIR, increased rates of apoptosis, and increased 
gene transcription and protein release for IP-10 and MCP-1. Cytokine-treated
IRF-1(-/-) islets demonstrated relatively less iNOS gene expression, preserved
GSIR, reduced rates of apoptosis, and a more marked increase in transcription for
IP-10 and MCP-1 and in IP-10 protein release. L-NMMA-cotreated WT islets were
completely resistant to cytokine-induced dysfunction and apoptosis but
demonstrated the same degree of cytokine-induced chemokine gene expression as
cytokine-treated WT without L-NMMA.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in combination induce chemokine
gene expression in pancreatic islets. Transcription factor IRF-1 mediates
cytokine-induced islet dysfunction, apoptosis, and iNOS gene expression but
down-regulates IP-10 gene expression.

Aberrant signalling and transcription factor activation as an explanation for the
defective growth control and differentiation of keratinocytes in psoriasis: a
hypothesis.

McKenzie RC(1), Sabin E.

Author information:

University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Roddie.McKenzie@ed.ac.uk

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the
accumulation of red, scaly plaques on the skin. The plaques result from
hyperproliferation and incomplete differentiation of keratinocytes (KC) in a
process that seems to be driven, in part by skin-infiltrating leucocytes. We
believe that the KC have inherent defects in intracellular signalling which could
be usefully targeted to allow the development of more effective therapies. We
suggest that there are defects in the regulation of the transcription factors:
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1alpha), interferon
regulated factor-1 (IRF-1) and NFkappaB which lead to loss of growth and
differentiation control when the cells are subjected to physico-chemical and
immunological stress. We also highlight recent studies that suggest that
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, the notch receptor and defects in
calcium and other ion transporting proteins may contribute to impairment in the
ability of psoriatic KC to differentiate. The role of these systems in the
development of the psoriatic phenotype and tests of these hypotheses are
proposed.

Synergistic expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase by phorbol ester and
interferon-gamma is mediated through NF-kappaB and ERK in microglial cells.

Han IO(1), Kim HS, Kim HC, Joe EH, Kim WK.

Author information: 
(1)Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Gyeonggi, Republic of
Korea.

A proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma stimulates microglia in the injured brain;
however, signaling pathways for IFN-gamma-mediated microglia activation are not
well characterized. In the present study, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) acts in concert with IFN-gamma to enhance
nitric oxide (NO) production in murine microglial BV2 cells by synergistically
increasing expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The synergistic NO
production by PMA was in part decreased by a PKC inhibitor Gö6976. PMA alone
induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
subtypes, whereas IFN-gamma alone had little effect. PMA and IFN-gamma
synergistically enhanced activity of NF-kappaB, but not ERK. The inhibitors of
NF-kappaB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, PDTC) and ERK
(1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4 bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene; U0126) markedly
decreased synergistic NO production in BV2 cells treated with IFN-gamma and PMA
in combination. We found further that co-treatment with IFN-gamma and PMA
synergistically induced interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which is the
major transcription factor for IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS expression. The present
results demonstrate the cooperative interaction of multiple signaling pathways in
the induction of NO production in activated microglial cells, and suggest that
the functional interplay of these pathways may be important for the onset of
microglia-mediated inflammatory responses in brain.

Limitin has sequence homology with alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) and IFN-beta and 
utilizes the IFN-alpha/beta receptor. However, it has no influence on the
proliferation of normal myeloid and erythroid progenitors. In this study, we show
that limitin has antiviral activity in vitro as well as in vivo. Limitin
inhibited not only cytopathic effects in encephalomyocarditis virus- or herpes
simplex virus (HSV) type 1-infected L929 cells, but also plaque formation in
mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) type 2-infected DBT cells. In addition,
administration of limitin to mice suppressed MHV-induced hepatitis and
HSV-induced death. The antiviral activity may be mediated in part by
2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, RNA-dependent protein kinase, and Mx protein,
which inhibit viral replication or degrade viral components, because limitin
induced their mRNA expression and enzyme activity. While limitin has antiviral
activity as strong as that of IFN-alpha in vitro (the concentration that provided
50% inhibition of cytopathic effect is approximately 30 pg/ml), IFN regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1) dependencies for induction of an antiviral state were different 
for limitin and IFN-alpha. In IRF-1-deficient fibroblasts, a higher concentration
of limitin than of IFN-alpha was required for the induction of antiviral activity
and the transcription of proteins from IFN-stimulated response element. The
unique signals and the fewer properties of myelosuppression suggest that a human 
homolog of limitin may be used as a new antiviral drug.

Nramp1 functionality increases inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription via 
stimulation of IFN regulatory factor 1 expression.

Author information:

Natural-resistance associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) encodes a
transmembrane phagolysosomal protein exerting resistance toward infections with
intracellular pathogens by a mechanism not fully elucidated so far. We used the
murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, stably transfected with functional (RAW-37)
or nonfunctional (RAW-21) Nramp1, to study for differences in the expression of
NO, a central antimicrobial effector molecule of macrophages. Following
stimulation with IFN-gamma and LPS, Nramp1-expressing cells exhibit higher
enzymatic activity of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and increased cytoplasmic iNOS
mRNA levels than RAW-21 cells. Time-course experiments showed that iNOS-mRNA
levels remain increased in RAW-37 cells after prolonged cytokine stimulation
while they decrease in RAW-21 cells. Reporter gene assays with iNOS-promoter
luciferase constructs demonstrated an increased and prolonged promoter activity
in Nramp1-resistant vs susceptible cells. This was paralleled by increased IFN
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) expression and binding affinity to the iNOS promoter 
in RAW-37 cells, which may be related to enhanced STAT-1 binding affinity in
these cells. A point mutation within the IRF-1 binding site of the iNOS promoter 
abolished the differences in iNOS transcription between RAW-21 and RAW-37 cells. 
Cells carrying functional Nramp1 express increased amounts of NO, which may be
related to STAT-1-mediated stimulation of IRF-1 expression with subsequent
prolonged activation of iNOS transcription. Enhanced NO expression may partly
underlie the protection against infection with intracellular pathogens by Nramp1 
functionality.

Induction of apoptosis by combined treatment with differentiation-inducing agents
and interferon-alpha in human lung cancer cells.

(1)Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, 818 Komuro, Ina, Saitama 362-0806,
Japan. yamaguchi@cancer-c.pref.saitama.jp

BACKGROUND: Differentiation-inducing agents for myeloid leukemic cells, such as
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Na-butyrate and hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA),
barely induce irreversible differentiation or growth inhibition in solid tumors
when used alone. However, we previously reported that combined treatment with
differentiation-inducing agents and interferon (IFN)-alpha effectively suppressed
the growth of human lung cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. We show here
that combined treatment-induced cell death is caused by apoptosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Induction of apoptosis was examined by expression of
several apoptotic markers.
RESULTS: Combined treatment-induced cell death is caused by apoptosis, which is
characterized by the induction of apoptotic morphological changes and the
activation of caspase-3-like protease. The expression of Apo2.7, an early
apoptotic change, is also induced by this combined treatment, and is suppressed
by the addition of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, a pan caspase inhibitor. The signal
transduction pathway of IFN-alpha is rapidly observed in lung cancer cells,
although it does not induce significant growth inhibition when used alone. We
analyzed the effect of IFN-alpha on the apoptotic pathway and found that
IFN-alpha but not DMSO induces the expression of caspase-4. The combination of
IFN-alpha and DMSO did not cause further increase in the expression of caspase-4.
In many cases of the induction of apoptosis, cytochrome c is released from
mitochondria, which induces the formation of large caspase-activating complexes. 
Caspase-3-like-activities induced by the combination of DMSO or Na-butyrate with 
IFN-alpha were analyzed by gel filtration and detected equally in fractions with 
molecular weights of 200-300 kDa, suggesting that caspase-3 is activated in large
complexes in lung cancer cells. However, Na-butyrate and HMBA, when used alone,
induced the release of cytochrome c and enhanced the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, whereas DMSO had no effect.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the combination of
differentiation-inducing agents with IFN-alpha effectively induces apoptosis in
lung cancer cells whereas the mechanism of such induction varies depending on the
differentiation-inducing agent used.

A giant GTPase, very large inducible GTPase-1, is inducible by IFNs.

Klamp T(1), Boehm U, Schenk D, Pfeffer K, Howard JC.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

The complex, partially overlapping, cellular responses to IFN type I (IFN-alpha
and -beta) and IFN type II (IFN-gamma) involve several hundred genes that can be 
largely classified in terms of specific cellular programs functional in innate
and adaptive immunity. Among these programs are previously unconsidered
mechanisms of cell-autonomous resistance against various pathogens mediated by
dedicated, largely novel families of GTPases. We report here the identification
and characterization of a new GTPase family that contributes to the cellular
response to both type I and type II IFNs. We name this family the very large
inducible GTPases (VLIGs). The prototype VLIG, VLIG-1, is a strongly
IFN-inducible, soluble, cytosolic and nuclear protein of 280 kDa. The open
reading frame of VLIG-1 is encoded on a single very large exon, and outside the
canonical GTP-binding motifs, sequence and structural prediction suggest a unique
family without significant relationship to other known protein families. Within
the GTPase superfamily the VLIG family is more closely related to IFN-inducible
GTPases mediating cell-autonomous resistance than to other GTPase families. In
addition, we provide evidence that VLIG-1 is polymorphic in mice of different
genetic backgrounds and is a member of a small gene family on mouse chromosome 7 
with a conserved homologue located on human chromosome 11.

Syngeneic IFN-gamma(-/-) and IRF-1(-/-) mice are very sensitive to B16F10-Nex2
murine melanoma cells implanted subcutaneously. In contrast, IFN-gamma-R(-/-)
(GRKO) mice are remarkably resistant to tumor development. Only 0-30% of these
animals, challenged with a high dose of melanoma cells (5 x 10(5)), developed
tumors at a late stage. The hypothesis of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)
accumulation and consequent cytotoxicity to implanted tumor cells was confirmed
in vitro and ex vivo. IFN-gamma reduced tumor-cell growth in vitro in 60-81%,
added alone or with LPS. Splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages from naïve GRKO
mice activated with anti-CD3 and interleukin-12 (IL-12), respectively,
accumulated IFN-gamma at levels 10-fold those of the wild-type. Supernatants of
IL-12-activated macrophages from GRKO mice were toxic to B16F10-Nex2 cells, an
effect reversible by anti-IFN-gamma antibody treatment. IL-12-activated
macrophages from iNOS(-/-) mice were still highly cytotoxic to B16F10-Nex2 cells,
but IL-12-activated macrophages from IFN-gamma-deficient mice were not
inhibitory. In vivo, a single injection of anti-IFN-gamma antibody 18 h after
tumor-cell challenge in GRKO mice rendered all animals susceptible to B16F10-Nex2
melanoma development. No tumors developed in the untreated GRKO mice during up to
45 days of observation. This model can be useful in understanding immune
responses that involve IFN-gamma as a direct cytotoxic factor.

Prolactin (PRL) is a versatile hormone that is produced by the anterior pituitary
gland and various extrapituitary sites including immune cells. Furthermore, PRL
has widespread influences on proliferation and differentiation of a variety of
cells in the immune system and is, in effect, a cytokine. PRL-receptors (PRL-R)
are distributed throughout the immune system and are included as members of the
cytokine receptor superfamily. PRL-R signal transduction is mediated by a complex
array of signaling molecules of which JAK2, Stat1 and Stat5 pathway have been
well studied. In PRL-stimulated T cells, the transcription factor gene,
interferon regulatory factor-1 provides a mechanism whereby PRL can regulate the 
immune response. The human PRL gene is situated on the short arm of chromosome 6 
close to the major histocompatibility complex. Polymorphisms of the human PRL
gene have implications for production of lymphocyte PRL in SLE. Mild and moderate
hyperprolactinemia (HPRL) has been demonstrated in 20-30% of SLE patients and is 
associated with active disease. HPRL may have a role in lupus nephritis and
central nervous system involvement of SLE patients. HPRL stimulated the
production of autoantibodies. These evidences support the important role of PRL
in autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, mainly SLE.

Inhibition of IFN-gamma-mediated inducible nitric oxide synthase induction by the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, 15-deoxy-delta
12,14-prostaglandin J2, involves inhibition of the upstream Janus kinase/STAT1
signaling pathway.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands have been
reported to exert anti-inflammatory activities in macrophages by competition for 
transcriptional coactivators with some transcriptional factors, including
NF-kappaB. In the present study the influence of PPARgamma activators on
IFN-gamma-elicited macrophage stimulation and signaling cascades was
investigated. The results show that IFN-gamma-induced inducible NO synthase
(iNOS) gene transcription, iNOS protein induction, and NO production are more
sensitive to inhibition by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15dPGJ(2))
than by the other two PPARgamma agonists, GW1929 and ciglitazone. Delayed
addition of 15dPGJ(2) for 2 h resulted in reduced inhibition, suggesting action
by 15dPGJ(2) on the upstream signaling cascades. Immunoblotting, DNA binding, and
reporter gene assays consistently revealed the inhibitory ability of 15dPGJ(2),
but not GW1929 or ciglitazone, on IFN-gamma-elicited signaling cascades,
including tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus tyrosine protein kinase 2 and STAT1, 
DNA binding, and IFN regulatory factor-1 trans-activation of STAT1. These effects
of 15dPGJ(2) were not abrogated by the PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A
diglycidyl ether, indicating the PPARgamma-independent actions. 15dPGJ(2) also
attenuated IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in Hep3B
hepatoma cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of reactive oxygen species 
on STAT1 signaling, STAT1 inhibition by 15dPGJ(2) was abrogated by
N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. Furthermore,
15dPGJ(2)-induced inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and NO production still
occurred in the presence of peroxovanadate, ruling out the action mechanism of
15dPGJ(2) on tyrosine phosphatase. Taken together, for the first time in this
study we demonstrate that 15dPGJ(2) can inhibit cytokine-stimulated Janus kinase 
2-STAT signaling through a PPARgamma-independent, reactive oxygen
species-dependent mechanism. These data provide a novel molecular mechanism of
iNOS inhibition by 15dPGJ(2) and confirm its physiological role in
anti-inflammation.

Thyrotropin-mediated repression of class II trans-activator expression in thyroid
cells: involvement of STAT3 and suppressor of cytokine signaling.

It has been suggested that class I and class II MHC are contributing factors for 
numerous diseases including autoimmune thyroid diseases, type 1 diabetes,
rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The class II
trans-activator (CIITA), which is a non-DNA-binding regulator of class II MHC
transcription, regulates the constitutive and inducible expression of the class I
and class II genes. FRTL-5 thyroid cells incubated in the presence of IFN-gamma
have a significantly higher level of cell surface rat MHC class II RTI.B.
However, the IFN-gamma-induced RT1.B expression was suppressed significantly in
cells incubated in the presence of thyrotropin. Thyrotropin (TSH) represses
IFN-gamma-induced CIITA expression by inhibiting type IV CIITA promoter activity 
through the suppression of STAT1 activation and IFN regulatory factor 1
induction. This study found that TSH induces transcriptional activation of the
STAT3 gene through the phosphorylation of STAT3 and CREB activation. TSH induces 
SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, and TSH-mediated SOCS-3 induction was dependent on STAT3. The 
cell line stably expressing the wild-type STAT3 showed a higher CIITA induction
in response to IFN-gamma and also exhibited TSH repression of the
IFN-gamma-mediated induction of CIITA. However, TSH repression of the
IFN-gamma-induced CIITA expression was not observed in FRTL-5 thyroid cells,
which stably expresses the dominant negative forms of STAT3, STAT3-Y705F, and
STAT3-S727A. This report suggests that TSH is also engaged in immunomodulation
through signal cross-talk with the cytokines in thyroid cells.

PURPOSE: The human mimecan/osteoglycin promoter contains multiple
interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and interferon-gamma-activation
sites (GAS). ISRE and GAS motifs are present in a variety of interferon
(IFN)-inducible genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
IFN-gamma affects mimecan gene expression and, if so, to determine the
cis-elements and transcription factors that mediate its action.
METHODS: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to investigate
whether nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma-treated cells bind to regions of the
human mimecan promoter containing ISRE sites. Incubation of nuclear extracts with
specific antibodies was used to identify transcription factors that bind to these
sites. Transcriptional activity of the promoter was evaluated by transient
transfections of human mimecan promoter/luciferase reporter constructs into
corneal keratocytes and non-corneal cells. Co-transfection experiments were used 
to study the role of transcription factors that bind ISRE elements in the
promoter and mediate the IFN-gamma response. Expression of mRNAs was analyzed by 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Using probes that correspond to two ISRE sites located in the first
intron of the human mimecan gene, we detected specific DNA-protein complexes with
nuclear extracts from IFN-gamma-treated cells. Formation of DNA-protein complexes
was abrogated by competition with unlabeled probe and one of the complexes was
supershifted by the anti-interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) antibody.
Interestingly, when probe that corresponds to a conserved E-box (CACATG) in the
proximal promoter and nuclear extracts from IFN-gamma-treated cells were used in 
EMSA, increased binding of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) was observed.
Co-transfection of a mimecan promoter construct that contained the entire first
intron with IRF-1, or with both IRF-1 and USF-1 expression plasmids, suppressed
luciferase activity of the promoter in corneal keratocytes and T-47D cells. In
contrast, co-transfection experiments with IRF-2, or with both IRF-2 and USF-1,
led to increased luciferase activity of the same promoter construct. RT-PCR
analyses demonstrate that IFN-gamma rapidly and transiently suppresses mimecan
expression and induces IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNAs in bovine corneal keratocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF-1 binds to ISRE sites, located in the first intron of the human 
mimecan gene, and negatively regulates mimecan expression at the level of
transcription. Consistent with these observations, an inverse correlation between
the expression of mimecan and IRF-1 in bovine corneal keratocytes and non-corneal
cells was demonstrated. IRF-2 positively regulates mimecan transcription in
corneal keratocytes. Because the intact E-box in the proximal promoter was
required for IRF-1 and IRF-2 effects on mimecan transcription, potential direct
or indirect interactions between USF-1 and IRF-1 and IRF-2 are likely.

IFN-alpha induces the human IL-10 gene by recruiting both IFN regulatory factor 1
and Stat3.

The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 can be induced by type I IFNs, but the
molecular mechanisms involved have remained elusive. With in silico analysis of
the human IL-10 promoter we identified a module consisting of an IFN regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1) site and a Stat3 site. We demonstrate that IFN-alpha will induce
the binding of IRF-1 and Stat3 to the respective motifs. Mutational analysis
revealed that inactivation of the IRF-1 motif substantially reduces
trans-activation from 5- to 2-fold and that inactivation of the Stat3 motif
completely ablates trans-activation by IFN-alpha. The dominant role of Stat3 in
this module was confirmed with the blockade of trans-activation by a dominant
negative Stat3. By contrast, Stat1 contributes a minor proportion to the DNA
binding to the Stat site, and overexpression will counteract Stat3-mediated
trans-activation. The data show that IFN-alpha induces the IL-10 gene via a
module consisting of interdependent IRF-1 and Stat3 motifs. Of note, LPS-induced 
trans-activation does not target this module, since it is independent of the
IRF-1 motif but completely depends on Stat3.

Interferon-gamma augments CARD4/NOD1 gene and protein expression through
interferon regulatory factor-1 in intestinal epithelial cells.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical
School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.

Although intestinal epithelial cells appear to be functionally hyporesponsive to 
normal intestinal flora, human intestinal epithelial cells can respond to
enteroinvasive bacteria and induce an inflammatory response. This initial
inflammatory response leads to the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to
the affected site in vitro and in vivo. CARD4/NOD1 is a potential cytosolic
receptor for peptidoglycan in mammalian cells that resembles pathogen-resistant
proteins of plants. In this context, CARD4/NOD1 is a candidate for a recognition 
protein of intracellular bacteria or peptidoglycan in intestinal epithelial
cells. In this study, we demonstrate that CARD4/NOD1 is constitutively expressed 
in intestinal epithelial cell lines and isolated primary intestinal epithelial
cells. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine 
in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a 
time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein
in SW480 cells. Promoter analysis of CARD4/NOD1 indicates that interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding motif (-791 to -782) is essential for the
effect of IFN gamma. Nuclear extracts from SW480 cells treated with IFN gamma
show specific binding of oligonucleotides corresponding to this IRF-1-binding
motif, which was supershifted by anti-IRF-1 antibody in electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay. Overexpression of IRF-1 protein activates the CARD4/NOD1 promoter
but not the deletion mutant of the IRF-1-binding site in a co-transfection assay 
of IRF-1 expression plasmid with CARD4/NOD1 promoter. These studies suggest that 
the Th1 cytokine, IFN gamma, activates CARD4/NOD1 transcription and regulate
innate immune mechanisms in the condition of intestinal mucosal inflammation.

Protection from autoimmune brain inflammation in mice lacking IFN-regulatory
factor-1 is associated with Th2-type cytokines.

Cologne, Weyertal 121, 50931 Cologne, Germany.

IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates the
expression of IFN-induced genes and type I IFN. It has previously been
demonstrated that IRF-1-deficient mice show reduced susceptibility to
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by a peptide from myelin 
basic protein. To further study the role of IRF-1 in brain inflammation, we
analyzed EAE induced by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein-derived peptide in 129/Sv mice lacking IRF-1. We found that these
mice were almost completely resistant to EAE induction and that this
unresponsiveness was intrinsically related to the IRF-1 deficiency of the T
cells, but not with any other cell type. Furthermore, we show that the
amelioration of EAE was associated with increased production of T(h)2-type and
decreased production of T(h)1-type cytokines. These results demonstrate that
absence of IRF-1 in myelin-specific T cells results in protection from severe EAE
and is associated with a skewing of the T cell response towards T(h)2.

Differential regulation of interleukin-12 p40 and p35 induction via Erk
mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms and the
implications for bioactive IL-12 and IL-23 responses.

Goodridge HS(1), Harnett W, Liew FY, Harnett MM.

Glasgow, UK.

Bioactive interleukin (IL)-12 is a 70 000-molecular weight (MW) heterodimeric
cytokine comprising p40 and p35 chains. However, p40 can also form homodimers
that antagonize bioactive IL-12 or heterodimerize with p19 to form IL-23, which
exhibits overlapping yet distinct functions to that of IL-12. We now define
distinct signalling mechanisms that regulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated
induction of IL-12 p40 and p35 in macrophages and which may therefore provide
therapeutic targets for precise and specific fine-tuning of cytokine responses.
Thus, whilst LPS-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPkinase)
activation is required for the induction of both p40 and p35 subunits, Erk
MAPkinase signalling mediates negative feedback regulation of p40, but not p35,
production. Such Erk MAPkinase activation is downstream of calcium influx and
targets LPS-induced IL-12 p40 transcription by suppressing the synthesis of the
transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). In contrast,
negative regulation of the p35 subunit of IL-12 occurs via a calcium-dependent,
but Erk-independent, mechanism, which is likely to involve nuclear factor
(NF)-kappa B signalling. Finally, the importance of both Erk and p38 MAPkinases
in differentially regulating IL-12 p40 and p35 production is underscored by each 
being targeted by ES-62, a product secreted by parasitic filarial nematodes to
polarize the immune system towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype conducive to
their survival.

To investigate the intra-hepatic activation of the IFN system in patients
affected by chronic HCV-infection in comparison with that observed in a
non-infectious liver disease such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, we measured
the liver steady state mRNA levels of interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and
interferon-gamma as well as of IFN-related genes (IFNAR-1, STAT1alpha, PKR, 2-5
AS, IRF-1, ICE and IL-18). In HCV-infected subjects, possible correlations of
these parameters with viral load and liver injury were also analyzed. Twenty-four
chronic untreated HCV-infected subjects and seven patients with non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis were enrolled in the study. Liver biopsies were graded according 
to Knodell scores. Intra-hepatic mRNA levels of IFNs and related genes were
assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In comparison with non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis, in HCV-infected subjects IFN-alpha and -beta mRNA levels were
significantly lower, whereas IFN-gamma, IFNAR-1, STAT1alpha IRF-1, and IL-18 mRNA
were upregulated. Moreover, IFN-gamma mRNA steady state levels were correlated
positively with those of IFNAR-1, IRF-1, and IL-18, suggesting a coordinated
induction of these genes. Although plasma viral load was correlated inversely
with IL-18-specific mRNA, viral load was not related to liver injury. IFN-gamma
and IRF-1 mRNA levels were correlated positively with ALT, but not with the
grading or staging. Conversely, IFN-alpha and -beta mRNA levels were higher in
livers with lower staging scores. These findings support the hypothesis that in
chronic HCV infection there is an imbalance between an upregulated IFN-gamma
system and a downregulated IFN-alpha and -beta system, probably due to a mixed
effect exerted by HCV-specific and inflammatory non-specific factors.

Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy characterized by a Th1-type immune response
to the dietary gluten. The transcriptional mechanisms or factors that control Th1
cell development in this condition remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study
was to analyze in CD the expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor
(IRF)-1, a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation and function
of Th1 cells. Duodenal biopsies were taken from children with untreated CD and
control children, and analyzed for IRF-1 by Southern blotting of
reverse-transcriptase PCR products and Western blotting. IRF-1 DNA-binding
activity was assessed by electrophoretic shift mobility assay. The effect of
gliadin stimulation on IRF-1 induction was investigated in an ex vivo organ
culture of treated CD biopsies. Enhanced IRF-1 was seen in untreated CD in
comparison with controls. This was evident at both the RNA and protein level.
Furthermore, untreated CD samples exhibited stronger nuclear accumulation and
DNA-binding activity of IRF-1 than controls. In contrast, IRF-2, a
transcriptional repressor that binds the same DNA element and competes with
IRF-1, was expressed at the same level in nuclear proteins extracted from both
untreated CD and control patients. In explant cultures of treated CD biopsies,
gliadin enhanced both IRF-1 RNA and protein. This effect was prevented by a
neutralizing IFN-gamma antibody. Furthermore, stimulation of normal duodenal
biopsies with IFN-gamma enhanced IRF-1. These data indicate that IRF-1 is a
hallmark of the gliadin-mediated inflammation in CD and suggest that
IFN-gamma/IRF-1 signaling pathway can play a key role in maintaining and
expanding the local Th1 inflammatory response in this disease.

Inhibition of interferon-gamma-activated nuclear factor-kappa B by cyclosporin A:
A possible mechanism for synergistic induction of apoptosis by interferon-gamma
and cyclosporin A in gastric carcinoma cells.

We previously reported synergistic induction of apoptosis by IFN-gamma plus
either cyclosporin A (CsA) or tacrolimus (FK506) in gastric carcinoma cells. In
this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism for this synergistic induction of
apoptosis. IFN-gamma plus CsA synergistically induced caspase-3 mediated
apoptosis in gastric carcinoma cells. Although IFN-gamma induced activation of
signal transducer and activator of transcription1 (STAT1) and expression of
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) mRNA, IFN-gamma alone was not able to
induce caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. When gastric carcinoma cells were
treated with cyclohexamide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, following IFN-gamma
pretreatment, caspase-3 was activated, and apoptosis was markedly induced. These 
findings suggest the existence of IFN-gamma-induced anti-apoptotic pathway and we
evaluated the effect of IFN-gamma and CsA on calcium-sensitive nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. IFN-gamma increased intracellular calcium
ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) consisting of a spike and a sustained phase, and 
the latter was completely abrogated by CsA. Activation of NF-kappa B occurred in 
response to IFN-gamma, and which was markedly inhibited by either CsA or FK506.
NF-kappa B decoy also enhanced the cytotoxic effect of IFN-gamma. These results
suggest that IFN-gamma may simultaneously induce the STAT1-mediated apoptotic
pathway and the anti-apoptotic pathway through calcium-activated NF-kappa B and
that inhibition of the latter by CsA may result in dominance of the
apoptosis-inducing pathway.

Identification, structural characterization, and tissue distribution of Tsg-5: a 
new TNF-stimulated gene.

Abrantes EF(1), Pires EG, Carvalho AF, Costa FF, Savino W, Reis LF.

Author information: 
(1)Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, São Paulo, Brazil.

Using DDRT-PCR, we compared the mRNA content of untreated and TNF-treated mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Among differentially represented fragments, we
identified and cloned a novel TNF-stimulated gene named Tsg-5. This gene, mapped 
to mouse chromosome 14, has three exons that can be alternatively spliced giving 
rise to two mRNA species, one spanning three exons and another that skips the
second exon. Analysis of full-length Tsg-5 cDNA revealed a potential start codon 
within exon 2 encoding an ORF of 40 amino-acids. No homology with known mouse or 
human sequences, neither at the nucleotide nor at the amino-acid level could be
found in public databases. In MEFs, Tsg-5 is induced by tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF) and IL-1 beta, albeit with distinct kinetics. TNF-induced
Tsg-5 expression is NF-kappa B-dependent as it was inhibited by MG132,
lactacystin, Bay 11-7083, and Bay 11-7085. Analysis of Tsg-5 expression in vivo
revealed that the gene and its encoded polypeptide are constitutively expressed
in the thymus and ovary, whereas, in LPS-treated mice, Tsg-5 mRNA can be detected
in the spleen, lung, and brain. Our data suggest that Tsg-5 encodes a new, rare
transcript, with a very tight regulation of expression and differential splicing.

Involvement of beta interferon in enhancing inducible nitric oxide synthase

Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a
life-threatening disease that affects both humans and animals. This bacterium is 
able to survive and multiply inside both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells. We
recently reported that mouse macrophages infected with B. pseudomallei fail to
produce a significant level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a crucial 
enzyme needed for the cells to control the intracellular growth of this
bacterium. In the present study, we extended our investigation to demonstrate
that, unlike other gram-negative bacteria that have been investigated, B.
pseudomallei only minimally activates beta interferon (IFN-beta) production; this
minimal activation leads to a low level of interferon regulating factor 1 (IRF-1)
in the macrophages, in parallel with poor iNOS expression. Adding exogenous
IFN-beta to the system could upregulate IRF-1 production, which in turn could
enhance iNOS expression in the B. pseudomallei-infected macrophages and lead to
suppression of the intracellular growth of this bacterium. Taken together, these 
results imply that the failure of macrophages to successfully control the growth 
and survival of intracellular B. pseudomallei is related, at least in part, to
the defective production of IFN-beta, which modulates the ability of macrophages 
to synthesize iNOS.

Cytogenetic studies of patients with therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia
(t-AML) have demonstrated whole chromosome loss or q-arm deletion of chromosomes 
5 and/or 7 in a majority of cases. We have established two cell lines, SAML-1 and
SAML-2, from two patients who developed t-AML after radiation and chemotherapy
for Hodgkin disease. In both cases, the leukemia cells contained 5q deletions.
SAML-1 has 58 chromosomes and numerous abnormalities, including
der(1)(1qter-->1p22::5q31-->5qter), der(5)(5pter-->5q22::1p22-->1pter), +8,
der(13)i(13)(q10)del(13)(q11q14.1), and t(10;11). Fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) with unique sequence probes for the 5q31 region showed loss 
of IL4, IL5, IRF1, and IL3, and translocation of IL9, DS5S89, EGR1, and CSFIR to 
1p. SAML-2 has 45 chromosomes, del(5)(q11.2q31) with a t(12;13)ins(12;5), leading
to the proximity of IRF1 and RB1, and complex translocations of chromosomes 8 and
11, resulting in amplification of MYC and MLL. Comparative genomic hybridization 
and spectral karyotyping were consistent with the G-banding karyotype and FISH
analyses. Because a potential tumor suppressor(s) in the 5q31 region has yet to
be identified, these cell lines should prove useful in the study of the
mechanisms leading to the development of t-AML.

IFN regulatory factor-1 is required for the up-regulation of the CD40-NF-kappa B

Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

Recent studies show that NF-kappa B activator 1 (Act1) functions as an important 
adapter molecule for CD40-mediated signaling in epithelial cells. To explore the 
physiological function of the CD40-Act1 axis, we studied the regulation of gene
expression of CD40 and Act1 both in vivo and in cell culture models. Although
CD40 and Act1 are up-regulated in mouse lung upon LPS stimulation, IL-1 plus
IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma synergistically up-regulate both CD40 and Act1 gene
expression in human epithelial A549 cells. Cycloheximide superinduces the Act1
mRNA, whereas actinomycin D completely abolishes the Act1 mRNA, indicating that
the induction of Act1 mRNA is at the transcriptional level and does not require
protein synthesis. Promoter sequence analyses identified putative IFN regulatory 
factor (IRF)-1, C/EBP-beta, and AP-1 transcription factor binding sites in the
Act1 promoter. Although mutation of any of the three sites abolished the promoter
activity, Abs against IRF-1 and C/EBP-beta, but not AP-1, blocked the formation
of the DNA-binding complex induced by IL-1 plus IFN-beta stimulation, suggesting 
cooperative action between IRF-1 and C/EBP-beta in mediating Act1 promoter
activity. Importantly, LPS-induced gene expression of CD40 and Act1 in the mouse 
lung is abolished in IRF-1(-/-) mice, indicating an essential role of
transcription factor IRF-1 in the coordinated regulation of these two genes
during airway inflammation. The induced expression of the CD40-Act1 axis by
inflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells probably plays an important role in
priming these cells for their response to CD40 ligand during airway inflammation.

The effect of interleukin (IL)-17 on the activation of inducible nitric oxide
(NO) synthase (iNOS) and subsequent production of NO was investigated. IL-17
induced NO production in both mouse and rat endothelial cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. This was paralleled by the induction of mRNA for iNOS,
which was markedly down-regulated by specific antagonists of protein tyrosine
kinase, p38 MAP kinase or iNOS transcription factor NF-kappaB. The expression of 
iNOS transcription factor IRF-1 was also induced by IL-17 and blocked by all
three inhibitors, suggesting that the induction of iNOS by IL-17 might be partly 
exerted through IRF-1 activation. Neutralization with the specific antibody
showed that endogenous IL-17 is involved in T cell-mediated NO production in
endothelial cells and NO-dependent suppression of T cell growth. These data
indicate that IL-17-triggered iNOS activation in endothelial cells might
participate in regulation of the T cell-dependent inflammatory response.

The tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor 1 interferes with SP1
activation to repress the human CDK2 promoter.

Cell growth control by interferons (IFNs) involves up-regulation of the tumor
suppressor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). To exert its anti-proliferative
effects, this factor must ultimately control transcription of several key genes
that regulate cell cycle progression. Here we show that the G1/S phase-related
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) gene is a novel proliferation-related downstream
target of IRF1. We find that IRF1, but not IRF2, IRF3, or IRF7, selectively
represses CDK2 gene transcription in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We
delineate the IRF1-responsive repressor element between nt -68 to -31 of the CDK2
promoter. For comparison, the tumor suppressor p53 represses CDK2 promoter
activity independently of IRF1 through sequences upstream of nt -68, and the
CDP/cut/Cux1 homeodomain protein represses transcription down-stream of -31.
Thus, IRF1 repression represents one of three distinct mechanisms to attenuate
CDK2 levels. The -68/-31 segment lacks a canonical IRF responsive element but
contains a single SP1 binding site. Mutation of this element abrogates
SP1-dependent enhancement of CDK2 promoter activity as expected but also
abolishes IRF1-mediated repression. Forced elevation of SP1 levels increases
endogenous CDK2 levels, whereas IRF1 reduces both endogenous SP1 and CDK2 protein
levels. Hence, IRF1 represses CDK2 gene expression by interfering with
SP1-dependent transcriptional activation. Our findings establish a causal series 
of events that functionally connect the anti-proliferative effects of interferons
with the IRF1-dependent suppression of the CDK2 gene, which encodes a key
regulator of the G1/S phase transition.

Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 expression may be coupled to
redox-sensitive regulatory pathways, and iron may play a role in generation of
reactive oxygen species that participate in these signaling pathways. To
investigate the role of iron in TNF alpha-induced VCAM-1 gene expression, human
dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were stimulated with TNF alpha in 
the presence of iron chelators and examined for expression of VCAM-1. The iron
chelators dipyridyl (DP) and desferoxamine (DFO) inhibited VCAM-1 protein and
mRNA induction in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The induction of
VCAM-1 was not inhibited by nonmetal binding reactive oxygen species (ROS)
scavengers, implying a direct effect of iron in the expression of these adhesion 
molecules. The effect of iron was mediated at the level of gene transcription
since pretreatment with DP abrogated the TNF alpha-mediated up-regulation of
VCAM-1 heterogeneous nuclear RNA. Pretreatment of HDMEC with DP prior to TNFalpha
treatment had no effect on p65 nuclear localization, DNA binding, or serine
phosphorylation. DP pretreatment inhibited TNF alpha- and IFN gamma-mediated
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) protein expression, although restoration
of IRF-1 expression failed to reconstitute VCAM-1 expression. DP treatment also
blocked VCAM-1 induction in human umbilical vein endothelium and blocked
induction of a host of NF-kB activated genes in HDMEC including ICAM-1, IL-8, and
tissue factor. I kappa B alpha, an NF-kappa B inducible and constitutively
accessible gene not requiring chromatin remodeling for transcription, was not
affected by DP treatment. These data suggest that iron plays a critical role in
TNF alpha mediated VCAM-1 induction in HDMEC, and the target for iron effects may
be IRF-1, NF-kappa B, and potentially chromatin remodeling.

factor-1.

University, 98 Kunja-dong, Kwangjin-gu, Seoul 143-747, Republic of Korea.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a putative tumor suppressor protein, is a
transcriptional mediator of interferon-responsive signaling pathways that are
involved in antiviral defense, apoptosis, immune response, and cell growth
regulation. To delineate the IRF-1 domain responsible for transactivation, we
performed a detailed deletion analysis of IRF-1. We found that the amino acid
segment 217-260 was necessary and sufficient for transactivation. The structure
of this region was predicted to be loop-helix-loop-sheet using the program PHD.
Further studies indicated that casein kinase II and protein kinase C sites on
each of the two loops are not important for transactivation, and a region
containing amino acids 233-255 comprises the core activation domain. To verify
the physiological role of segment 233-255, we constructed an IRF-1 deletion
mutant lacking these amino acids and examined it using IRF-1 transactivation
assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and in situ beta-galactosidase
staining techniques. From the results of these studies, we conclude that the
amino acid segment 233-255 of IRF-1 comprises the core activation domain required
for the physiological functions of IRF-1.

Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.

Recent reports suggest that a novel mechanism of glucocorticoid (GC)
immunosuppressive action is inhibition of signaling by IL-2 and IL-12, cytokines 
that use the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway. We investigated whether GCs
could also block activation of Janus kinase-STAT signaling by IFN-gamma, a potent
proinflammatory cytokine. Addition of dexamethasone to PBMC cultures resulted in 
a dramatic inhibition of IFN-gamma activation of STAT1. Several days of exposure 
to GCs were required for inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling to become apparent,
and the underlying mechanism was down-regulation of STAT1 expression. GCs
suppressed the expression of STAT1 mRNA, but did not affect STAT1 protein
stability. STAT1 expression and IFN-gamma signaling were preferentially
suppressed in macrophages. GCs did not act directly on macrophages, but worked
indirectly by regulating macrophage-lymphocyte interactions that control STAT1
expression. GCs inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible gene expression, thus demonstrating
the physiological significance of inhibition of signal transduction. Our results 
identify a novel level of regulation of IFN-gamma signaling, whereby GCs control 
the amplitude of IFN-gamma signaling by regulating STAT1 expression. These
results suggest that inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling contributes to the
immunosuppressive action of GCs.

rodent fibroblasts.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug that acts as a selective
inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). MMF has recently been
shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and
subsequent production of the cytotoxic free radical nitric oxide (NO) in
endothelial cells. We here investigated the effect of bioactive MMF compound
mycophenolic acid (MPA) on iNOS-mediated NO synthesis in fibroblasts, which are
important source of NO in rheumatoid arthritis and during rejection of solid
organ transplants. MPA exerted dose-dependent inhibition of NO synthesis,
measured as nitrite accumulation, in IFN-gamma + LPS-stimulated L929 mouse
fibroblast cell line and rat primary fibroblasts. The effect of MPA was not
mediated through interference with IMPDH-dependent synthesis of iNOS co-factor
BH4 and subsequent suppression of iNOS enzymatic activity, as direct BH4
precursor sepiapterin failed to block the action of the drug. MPA suppressed the 
IFN-gamma + LPS-induced expression of fibroblast iNOS protein, as well as mRNA
for iNOS and its transcription factor IRF-1, as assessed by cell-based ELISA and 
semiquantitative RT-PCR, respectively. MPA suppression of fibroblast NO release, 
iNOS, and IRF-1 activation, was efficiently prevented by exogenous guanosine,
indicating that the drug acted through reduction of IMPDH-dependent synthesis of 
guanosine nucleotides. These results suggest that MPA inhibits NO production in
fibroblasts by blocking guanosine nucleotide-dependent expression of iNOS gene,
through mechanisms that might involve the interference with the induction of iNOS
transcription factor IRF-1.

squamous carcinoma cells.

SiHa cervical squamous carcinoma cells were resistant to ATRA-induced growth
inhibitory effect at a physiological dose (10(-6) M), but responsive at a
pharmacological dose (10(-4) M). The observed growth arrest was associated with
increased levels of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 is a known 
inhibitor of cell growth, and thus our aim was to identify the downstream target 
of this growth inhibitory function. We found that, as with the induction of
IRF-1, levels of p21WAF1 were similarly dose-dependently induced by ATRA.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, gel-shift analysis (EMSA), antisense
gene expression and application of a STAT1-knockout cell line demonstrated that
activation of the p21WAF1 gene was IRF-1 and STAT1-dependent. We concluded that
activation of STAT1 and IRF-1 is crucial for the growth inhibitory action of
ATRA, which is associated with the activation of p21WAF1. These results might be 
useful in chemoprevention of cervical cancers.

All-trans-retinoic acid activates caspase-1 in a dose-dependent manner in
cervical squamous carcinoma cells.

Earlier we observed that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) dose-dependently
suppressed the growth of cervical carcinoma cells. Suppression of growth required
sustained activation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), which was
achieved by high-dose (10(-4) M), but not low-dose (10(-6) M), ATRA treatment. In
this paper we examine the role of IRF-1 in cell death that accompanied the growth
suppression in high-dose ATRA-treated cells. We found that high-dose, but not
low-dose, ATRA treatment activated caspase-1 in those cervical carcinoma cells.
Transient transfection of an antisense-IRF-1 construct diminished high-dose
ATRA-mediated caspase-1 activation. On the other hand, ATRA was not able to
induce caspase-1 expression in a STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1) knockout cell line, but transient transfection of STAT1 restored
it. These results suggested the importance of both IRF-1 and STAT1 in high-dose
ATRA-induced activation of caspase-1. Our results might be useful in the
treatment of retinoid-resistant cervical neoplasias.

Toll-like receptor-4 activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the
expression of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) in a MyD88-independent manner. Here we
report that mice devoid of the JAK protein tyrosine kinase family member, Tyk2,
were resistant to shock induced by high doses of LPS. Basal and LPS-induced
expression of IFN-beta and IFN-alpha4 mRNA in Tyk2-null macrophages were
diminished. However, Tyk2-null mice showed normal systemic production of nitric
oxide and proinflammatory cytokines and the in vivo response to tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) was unperturbed. IFN-beta-null but not STAT1-null mice were also
resistant to high dose LPS treatment. Together, these data suggest that Tyk2 and 
IFN-beta are essential effectors in LPS induced lethality.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor that controls the 
expression of genes related to inflammation and injury, may be involved in the
mechanisms of cerebral ischemia. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to
determine whether IRF-1 protein is up-regulated after cerebral ischemia, and to
define the identity of the cells that express IRF-1 in the postischemic brain. In
mice, IRF-1 immunoreactivity was present in intravascular neutrophils 24 h after 
middle cerebral artery occlusion. At 96 h, immunoreactivity was observed in
neutrophils infiltrating the ischemic tissue and in neurons at the outer border
of the ischemic territory. IRF-1 immunoreactivity was also found in neurons and
inflammatory cells in the brain of patients who died 1-2 days after ischemic
stroke. The neuronal expression of IRF-1, in conjunction with the finding that
IRF-1 deletion is beneficial to the post-ischemic brain, suggests that expression
of IRF-1-dependent genes in neurons plays a role in ischemic neuronal death.

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved innate 
immune recognition molecules and recognizes double-stranded RNA, a molecular
pattern associated with viral infections. Earlier studies suggested a
differential expression pattern in men and mice; the molecular basis for this
observation, however, was unknown. Here we demonstrate that species-specific
differences in tissue expression and responses to lipopolysaccaride (LPS)
coincide with the presence of different, evolutionary non-conserved promoter
sequences in both species. Despite the overall unrelatedness of TLR3 promoter
sequences, mRNA expression of both TLR3 orthologues was induced by interferons,
particularly by interferon (IFN)-beta. The basal and IFN-beta-induced activation 
of promoters from both species largely depended on similar interferon regulatory 
factor (IRF) elements, which constitutively bound IRF-2 and recruited IRF-1 after
stimulation. In murine macrophages, IFN-beta-induced TLR3 up-regulation required 
IFNAR1, STAT1, and in part IRF-1, but not the Janus kinase (Jak) family member
Tyk2. We also show that LPS specifically up-regulates TLR3 expression in murine
cells through the induction of autocrine/paracrine IFN-beta. In humans, however, 
IFN-beta-induced up-regulation of TLR3 was blocked by pretreatment with LPS,
despite the efficient induction of IRF-1. Our findings reveal a mechanistic basis
for the observed differences as well as similarities in TLR3 expression in men
and mice. The IFN-beta-TLR3 link further suggests a role of TLR3 in innate and
adaptive immune responses to viral infections. It will be interesting and
important to clarify whether the observed differences in the transcriptional
regulation of TLR3 influence innate immune responses in a species-specific
manner.

Tuberculosis is the seventh leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
world, with eight million cases per year. Animal and human studies demonstrate an
enrichment of CD4 cells at sites of disease, with a more favorable clinical
course when there is a Th1 response with the presence of gamma interferon
(IFN-gamma). We previously treated patients who had multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis with recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) in aerosol form and were
able to convert smear-positive cases to smear negative with 12 treatments over 1 
month. We hypothesized that rIFN-gamma would induce signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding 
activity in alveolar macrophages (AM). AM treated in vitro showed clear
upregulation of STAT-1 and IRF-1 by rIFN-gamma. STAT-1 was not activated and
IRF-1 was only weakly induced after 1 day of infection by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis TN913. In bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells obtained from 10 of 10 
tuberculosis patients 10 +/- 2 days post-antituberculosis treatment, there was no
detectable STAT-1 or IRF-1 DNA-binding activity. After 4 weeks of treatment with 
rIFN-gamma aerosol in addition to the antituberculosis drugs, 10 of 10 patients
had increased STAT-1, IRF-1, and/or IRF-9 DNA-binding activity in BAL cells from 
lung segments shown radiographically to be involved and in those shown to be
uninvolved. Symptoms and chest radiographs improved, and amounts of macrophage
inflammatory cytokines and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral
loads (in five of five HIV-1-coinfected patients) declined in the second BAL
specimens. rIFN-gamma aerosol induces signal transduction and gene expression in 
BAL cells and should be evaluated for efficacy in a randomized, controlled
clinical trial.

DNA plasmid vectors were constructed with inducible rainbow trout promoters to
take the place of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in DNA vaccines
for fish. DNA fragments containing the promoter regions upstream of the rainbow
trout Mx1 and interferon regulatory factor 1A (IRF1A) genes were obtained and
their nucleotide sequences were determined. Vectors containing the G gene of IHNV
linked to the trout promoters were found to be very effective as vaccines in
rainbow trout. In addition, we demonstrated that the IRF1A promoter is
transcriptionally active in mouse cells NIH-3T3 suggesting that this fish
promoter might be used for mammalian DNA vaccine development as well.

Intracellular metal ion chelators inhibit TNFalpha-induced SP-1 activation and
adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells.

Zhang WJ(1), Frei B.

Author information: 
(1)Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.

Endothelial adhesion molecule expression and monocyte recruitment are causal
events in human atherosclerosis, and are believed to be caused, in part, by
oxidative stress. Because redox-active transition metal ions, such as iron and
copper, play an essential role in the generation of free radicals and the
initiation and propagation of lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that transition
metal ions may also be involved in endothelial activation. Therefore, we
investigated the effects of the intracellular iron-chelator, desferrioxamine
(DFO), and the intracellular copper-chelator, neocuproine (NC), on
TNFalpha-induced expression of adhesion molecules in human aortic endothelial
cells (HAEC). Treatment of HAEC with DFO (0.01-0.1 mM) or NC (0.1 and 0.5 mM)
time- and dose-dependently inhibited TNFalpha-induced protein expression of
E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). In contrast, iron-saturated DFO and the
extracellular copper chelator, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, had no effect on
adhesion molecule expression. DFO and NC also dose-dependently inhibited
TNFalpha-induced upregulation of adhesion molecule mRNA levels. Furthermore,
treatment of HAEC with 0.5 mM DFO or NC completely inhibited TNFalpha-induced
activation of the transcription factor, specificity protein-1 (SP-1), but only
partially inhibited or did not affect activation of other transcription factors
known to regulate adhesion molecule expression, i.e., nuclear factor kappaB
(NFkappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1). Finally, inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase with
N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (0.5 mM) did not attenuate the inhibitory effects 
of the metal ion chelators on adhesion molecule expression. Our data suggest that
intracellular, but not extracellular, transition metal ions mediate inflammatory 
cytokine-induced SP-1 activation and adhesion molecule expression in endothelial 
cells.

Angiotensin II has been shown to exert complex effects on proximal tubular cell
function and growth. To assess some of the direct effects on proximal tubular
cells, changes in gene expression of selected cellular pathways were determined
after exposure to angiotensin II. We used DNA microarrays to analyze multiple
gene expression responses to increasing angiotensin II concentrations. Human
proximal tubular cells were grown in flasks, and the presence of angiotensin type
1 receptor was confirmed by Western blot analysis. At passages 4-6, these cells
were exposed to angiotensin II and harvested 4 h later and mRNA of the cells was 
extracted; 2 microg of mRNA was fluorescently conjugated for cDNA microarray
hybridization. A custom-made DNA microarray was designed by selecting 300 human
genes from 10 different functional systems and amplifying clones using polymerase
chain reaction. Cells were subjected to 10 and 100 nM angiotensin II with paired 
untreated cells as controls. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, labeled and
hybridized to the arrays and the ratios calculated. Ratios of > or =2.0 and < or 
=0.5 were considered significant. Coordinated changes were observed in genes of
the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 family (NHF3; HNF3A, HNF3B and HNF3G), in the E2F
genes (E2F1, E2F3) and the interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF5. Induction
of the expression of transcription factors points towards complex regulation of
gene expression upon angiotensin II exposure. Three genes involved in the
dampening of oxidative stress were enhanced. Taken together, brief exposure of
human tubular epithelial cells to angiotensin II elicited a marked induction of
nuclear factors, antioxidant genes and hormones and hormone receptor genes. The
quick activation of transcription factors by angiotensin II indicates that
angiotensin II can directly initiate a cascade of expressional events in proximal
tubular cells.

(1)Institute for Hormone and Fertility Research University of Hamburg, 22529

The oxytocin receptor (OTR) is expressed in the cow uterus at high levels at
estrus and at term of pregnancy. This expression appears to be controlled mostly 
at the transcriptional level and correlates with increasing estrogen
concentration and progesterone withdrawal. Approximately 3200 base pairs of the
upstream region of the bovine OTR gene were cloned and analyzed using a
combination of bioinformatic, electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA), and
transfection analyses. Using nuclear proteins from high- and low-expressing
tissues, EMSA indicated no significant quantitative or qualitative changes in
specific DNA-protein binding, suggesting that transcription is probably
controlled by signalling systems targeting constitutive factors. Using various
cell types, including primary and immortalized ruminant endometrial epithelial
cells, as hosts for transfection of promoter-reporter constructs showed that
endogenous activity resided only in the longest, i.e., 3.2-kb, construct but not 
in those shorter than 1.0 kb. While estrogen appears to be important in vivo, no 
effect of estradiol was found on any construct directly; only when the longest
3.2-kb construct was used in combination with some cotransfected steroid receptor
cofactors, e.g., SRC1e, was an estradiol-dependent effect observed. A putative
interferon-responsive element (IRE) was found at approximately -2,400 from the
transcription start site. This element was shown to bind mouse IRF1 and IRF2 as
well as similar proteins from bovine endometrial and myometrial nuclear extracts.
This element also responded to these factors when cotransfected into various cell
types. The bovine equivalents to IRF1 and IRF2 were molecularly cloned from
endometrial tissue and shown to be expressed in a temporal fashion, supporting
the role of interferon-tau in maternal recognition of pregnancy. Of many factors 
tested or analyzed, these components of the IFN system are the only ones found to
significantly influence the transcription of the bovine OTR gene.

Role of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and kappaB cis-regulatory elements on the

nitric oxide.

Nitric oxide (NO(.)) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an
important host defense molecule against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mononuclear
phagocytes. The objective of this study was to determine the role of the
IkappaBalpha kinase-nuclear factor kappaB (IKK-NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in
the induction of iNOS and NO(.) by a mycobacterial cell wall lipoglycan known as 
mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) in mouse macrophages costimulated with 
gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). NF-kappaB was activated by ManLAM as shown by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay, by immunofluorescence of translocated
NF-kappaB in intact cells, and by a reporter gene driven by four
NF-kappaB-binding elements. Transduction of an IkappaBalpha mutant (Ser32/36Ala) 
significantly inhibited NO(.) expression induced by IFN-gamma plus ManLAM. An
activated SCF complex, a heterotetramer (Skp1, Cul-1, beta-TrCP [F-box protein], 
and ROC1) involved with ubiquitination, is also required for iNOS-NO(.)
induction. Two NF-kappaB-binding sites (kappaBI and kappaBII) present on the
5'-flanking region of the iNOS promoter bound ManLAM-induced NF-kappaB similarly.
By use of reporter constructs in which one or both sites are mutated, both
NF-kappaB-binding positions were essential in iNOS induction by IFN-gamma plus
ManLAM. IFN-gamma-induced activation of the IRF-1 transcriptional complex is a
necessary component in host defense against tuberculosis. Although the
5'-flanking region of the IRF-1 promoter contains an NF-kappaB-binding site and
ManLAM-induced NF-kappaB also binds to this site, ManLAM was unable to induce
IRF-1 expression. The influence of mitogen-activated protein kinases on IFN-gamma
plus ManLAM induction of iNOS-NO(.) is not due to any effects on ManLAM induction
of NF-kappaB.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 disrupts Stat1-mediated gamma
interferon signal transduction in epithelial cells.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a clinically important
bacterial enteropathogen that manipulates a variety of host cell signal
transduction cascades to establish infection. However, the effect of EHEC O157:H7
on Jak/Stat signaling is unknown. To define the effect of EHEC infection on
epithelial gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-Stat1 signaling, human T84 and HEp-2
epithelial cells were infected with EHEC O157:H7 and then stimulated with
recombinant human IFN-gamma. Cells were also infected with different EHEC
strains, heat-killed EHEC, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) O127:H6, and the
commensal strain E. coli HB101. Nuclear and whole-cell protein extracts were
prepared and were assayed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and
by Western blotting, respectively. Cells were also processed for
immunofluorescence to detect the subcellular localization of Stat1. The EMSA
revealed inducible, but not constitutive, Stat1 activation upon IFN-gamma
treatment of both cell lines. The EMSA also showed that 6 h of EHEC O157:H7
infection, but not 30 min of EHEC O157:H7 infection, prevented subsequent Stat1
DNA binding induced by IFN-gamma, whereas infection with EPEC did not.
Immunoblotting showed that infection with EHEC, but not infection with EPEC,
eliminated IFN-gamma-induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation in both dose- and
time-dependent fashions and disrupted inducible protein expression of the
Stat1-dependent gene interferon regulatory factor 1. Immunofluorescence revealed 
that EHEC infection did not prevent nuclear accumulation of Stat1 after IFN-gamma
treatment. Also, Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation was suppressed by different EHEC 
isolates, including intimin-, type III secretion- and plasmid-deficient strains, 
but not by HB101 and heat-killed EHEC. These findings indicate the novel
disruption of host cell signaling caused by EHEC infection but not by EPEC
infection.

The expression of the transcriptional activator and tumor suppressor IRF-1
induces multiple effects that counteract the growth of tumor cells in vitro and
in vivo. These include the inhibition of cell proliferation, the secretion of
interferon-beta (IFN-beta), the induction of apoptosis specifically in certain
cell types and the induction of a strong T-cell response. Here, we show that
apart from its immune-activating properties, IRF-1 expression leads to a
reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype of NIH3T3 cells transformed by different
oncogenes. This was analysed in detail in a cell line in which the expression of 
c-Ha-ras and c-myc is under the control of a doxycycline-regulated promoter
allowing to switch between the normal and oncogenic cell status. In the same
cells, a beta-estradiol activatable IRF-1 fusion protein is expressed. After
IRF-1 activation the oncogene-mediated acceleration of the cell cycle is
reverted. Further, a complete IRF-1-mediated reversion of the oncogenic phenotype
is observed in soft-agar growth assays. IRF-1 activation induces IFN-beta
secretion; however, the observed effects are not mediated by IFN-beta. Inhibition
of tumor growth is observed in nude mice as long as IRF-1 is active, indicating
that neither B- nor T-cells must become activated for tumor growth suppression.

Caspases exist as zymogens, and are activated by various extracellular stimuli,
leading to apoptosis. One such stimulus is Fas/CD95, a member of the tumor
necrosis factor receptor family, providing one means of cytotoxic T lymphocyte
(CTL)-mediated cell lysis. Clinical evidence has shown that administration of
cytokine leads to regression in selected patients with renal cell carcinomas
(RCCs). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) indicates its contribution to anti-tumor
activity of immune cells. IFN-gamma elicits its effect through the transcription 
factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1), and through
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), one of the target genes of STAT-1. Our
previous study demonstrated an increase in the susceptibility of ACHN cells,
established from RCC, to Fas-mediated apoptosis by IFN-gamma, and the inhibition 
of this effect by the caspase-3 and -7 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO. We demonstrated the
following phenomena in IFN-gamma-treated ACHN cells: 1) enhanced transcription of
caspase-1, 3 and 7 mRNAs without any change in cleavage of their substrates; 2)
increased cleavage DEVD (specific for caspase-3 and 7), but not YVAD (for
caspase-1) or DMQD (for caspase-3), after anti-Fas/CD95 MAb treatment; 3)
activation of the STAT-1 and IRF-1 pathway; and 4) partial abrogation of the
IFN-gamma-induced increase in Fas-mediated apoptosis by antisense IRF-1
oligodeoxynucleotide. These results suggest that IRF-1 plays a pivotal role in
the IFN-gamma-mediated-enhancement of Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis, through
regulation of DEVD-CHO-sensitive caspases, most likely caspase-7.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a mediator for interferon-gamma induced
attenuation of telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) expression.

Constitutive activation of the telomerase is a key step in the development of
human cancers. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling induces growth arrest in
many tumors through multiple regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we show that
IFN-gamma signaling represses telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT) transcription, and suggest that this signaling is mediated 
by IRF-1. Ectopic expression of IRF-1 attenuated hTERT promoter activity. Murine 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in IRF-1 (IRF-1(-/-)) showed
an elevated level (>15 times) of hTERT promoter activity as compared to the hTERT
promoter activity of wild-type MEFs. The telomerase activity and hTERT expression
in IRF-1(-/-) MEFs were downregulated by IRF-1 transfection. Interestingly, less 
extent of telomerase repression was observed in HPV E6 and E7 negative, p53
mutant HT-3 cells than in HPV 18 E6 and E7 positive HeLa cells (intact p53).
These findings provide evidence that IRF-1 is a potential mediator of
IFN-gamma-induced attenuation of telomerase activity and hTERT expression.

The role of the interferon regulatory factors, IRF-1 and IRF-2, in LPS-induced
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in vivo and in vitro.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) exists as two isoforms: COX-1, which is constitutively
expressed in most cell types; and COX-2, which is inducible by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and cytokines in a variety of cell types. Although previous studies have
implicated two DNA binding proteins, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and
IRF-2, in the regulation of LPS- and IFN-gamma-induced COX-2, their effects in
vivo and in vitro are not well-defined. Using real-time PCR, COX-2 gene
expression in the livers and lungs of mice challenged in vivo and in macrophages 
stimulated with LPS in vitro was investigated in wild-type and in IRF-1 and IRF-2
knockout mice. In response to 35 mg/kg LPS, IRF-1-, but not IRF-2-deficient mice,
exhibited much poorer induction of COX-2 gene expression in both the livers and
lungs. In vitro, COX-2 mRNA levels were also poorly induced in IRF-1-deficient
macrophages, while IRF-2- deficient macrophages exhibited higher levels than in
normal macrophages. IRF-1 and IRF-2 were confirmed to activate and repress
expression of the COX-2 promoter, respectively, in a transient transfection
system and the role of specific DNA binding sites confirmed by site-specific
mutagenesis. Collectively, these data provide evidence for an important role for 
IRF-1 in vivo and in vitro and for IRF-2 in vitro in the regulation of COX-2
expression by LPS.

Negative association of melanoma differentiation-associated gene (mda-7) and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in human melanoma: MDA-7 regulates iNOS
expression in melanoma cells.

Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

The melanoma differentiation association gene-7 (mda-7) is a novel tumor
suppressor gene of which the protein expression decreases to nearly undetectable 
levels in metastatic melanoma. In contrast, expression of inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) is increased in advanced stages of melanoma, and iNOS expression 
has been proposed as a potential prognostic marker in this disease. Thus,
expression of these molecules in the same tumor appears to exhibit reciprocal
characteristics. We hypothesize that the relative ratios of these melanoma
progression molecules may define either tumor progression or tumor suppression in
human melanoma. The first goal of this study was to determine whether MDA-7
expression in melanoma negatively correlates with iNOS expression. The second
goal was to determine whether iNOS expression could be regulated by MDA-7
expression in melanoma cells. Expression of MDA-7 and iNOS proteins were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a total of 81 tumor samples: 38 primary
melanomas and 43 metastatic melanomas. Evaluation of these melanoma patient
samples showed that expression of MDA-7 and iNOS exhibits a significant negative 
correlation (P = 0.03). In vitro studies revealed that iNOS expression in
melanoma cell lines is lost in a dose-dependent fashion after treatment with an
adenoviral vector encoding the mda-7 gene (Ad-mda7) or with rhMDA-7 protein,
demonstrating that MDA-7 down-regulates iNOS expression. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the STAT-3-modulated expression of IFN regulatory factors 1 and 
2 is regulated by MDA-7, which may alter iNOS gene expression. These studies
demonstrate that expression of the MDA-7 tumor suppressor can negatively regulate
iNOS expression in malignant melanoma cell lines.

promoter.

IL-12 is a heterodimer composed of p40 and p35 and is a key cytokine that
functions to protect the host from viral and microbial infections. IL-12 links
the innate immune system with the acquired immune system during infection, and
induces differentiation of type 1 T cells that play an important role in the
eradication of microbes. The induction of the IL-12 p40 gene is regulated by
NF-kappaB in the presence of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma induces IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1), which in turn induces the transcription of the IL-12 p40 gene. However, 
the IRF-1 binding site in the promoter region of the IL-12 p40 gene has not yet
been formally determined. In the present study, we demonstrated that IRF-1
directly binds to the IL-12 p40 gene promoter and identified its binding site.
The IRF-1 binding site in the promoter region of the IL-12 p40 gene is shown to
be in the -72 to -58 area of the 5'-upstream region. The -63 to -61 position is
the critical site within this region for the binding of IRF-1 to the IL-12 p40
gene promoter. While IFN-gamma must be present for IL-12 p40 gene induction, the 
p35 gene is strongly induced by LPS, even in the absence of IFN-gamma, and
therefore the induction of the p35 gene is IRF-1 independent.

Kiyose, Tokyo 204-0022, Japan.

In order to understand the role of IRF-1 in the development of murine
tuberculosis in vivo, IRF-1 knockout mice were infected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis by placing them in the exposure chamber of an airborne infection
apparatus. These knockout mice developed multifocal necrotic lesions in the lung,
liver and spleen tissues and died of disseminated tuberculosis within 43 days of 
infection. Compared with the levels in wild-type mice, the pulmonary inducible NO
synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression level was significantly lower, but IL-18 and IL-6
mRNA levels were higher. There was no statistically significant difference in the
expression of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA between the IRF-1 knockout and
wild-type mice. IRF-1 is indirectly responsible for iNOS mRNA expression and
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of murine tuberculosis.

Neointima formation, the leading cause of restenosis after catheter angioplasty, 
is a paradigm for vascular proliferative responses. Neointima formation is
self-limiting after a variable degree of tissue growth, causing significant
renarrowing in a substantial number of patients. To investigate the mechanisms
that limit neointima formation we studied the role of the transcription factor
IRF-1, which is a regulator of interferons and a tumor suppressor. We demonstrate
that IRF-1 is highly regulated in human vascular lesions and exhibits a growth
inhibitory function in coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC). IRF-1
deficient mice display a high grade of susceptibility towards neointima formation
following vessel injury. IRF-1 leads to G(1) cell cycle arrest in CASMC and
induces the CDK inhibitor p21. In addition, IRF-1 induces NO production, which is
known to attenuate endothelial dysfunction. Mitogen-mediated cellular migration
is abrogated by IRF-1. In conclusion, IRF-1 displays pleiotropic anti-restenotic 
activities in vascular restenosis through transcriptional activation of several
relevant mechanisms that limit neointima formation. These findings suggest an
important role of this transcription factor as an endogenous inhibitor of
neointimal growth following vessel injury and it is likely that IRF-1 regulation 
also plays a role in the pathophysiology of primary atherosclerosis. In addition,
IRF-1 may be an interesting target for interventions to prevent neointimal
hyperplasia.

The IRF-2 DNA binding domain facilitates the activation of the class II
transactivator (CIITA) type IV promoter by IRF-1.

IFN-gamma induced transcription of class II transactivator (CIITA), a major
regulator of MHC class II gene expression, is directed by the CIITA type IV
promoter. The IFN-gamma activation of the CIITA type IV promoter is mediated by
STAT1 and IRF-1, which bind to the GAS and IRF-E of the promoter, respectively.
We and others have determined that IRF-2, another member of the IRF family, also 
activates the CIITA type IV promoter, by binding to the IRF-E. Also, IRF-2
cooperates with IRF-1 to activate the promoter. DNA binding analyses determined
that IRF-1 and IRF-2 can co-occupy the IRF-E of the CIITA type IV promoter. To
further understand the mechanism of IRF-1 and IRF-2 cooperativity in the
activation of CIITA type IV promoter, we characterized the binding of IRF-1 and
IRF-2 to the CIITA IRF-E and mapped the domains of IRF-2 required for the
cooperative transactivation. Off-rate experiments revealed that the IRF-2/IRF-E
complex was more stable than the IRF-1/IRF-E complex and that the affinity of
IRF-1 for the IRF-E was increased when IRF-1 co-occupied the IRF-E with IRF-2.
Deletion analysis of functional domains of IRF-2 revealed that a previously
described latent activation domain of IRF-2 was essential for IRF-2
transactivation and participated in cooperative activation of the CIITA promoter 
by IRF-1 and IRF-2. However, the DNA binding domain of IRF-2 was sufficient for
cooperativity with IRF-1 in the activation of the CIITA type IV promoter. DNA
binding assay demonstrated that, like the full-length IRF-2, the IRF-2 DNA
binding domain could co-occupy the CIITA IRF-E with IRF-1.

The promoter of IL-18 binding protein: activation by an IFN-gamma -induced
complex of IFN regulatory factor 1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta.

The IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a circulating inhibitor of the
proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. It is constitutively expressed in mononuclear
cells, and elevated expression is induced by IFN-gamma. In this study, we
characterized the IL-18BP promoter. We first showed that induction is at the
transcriptional level and requires de novo protein synthesis. The IL-18BP
promoter resides within 1.6 kb DNA upstream of the first exon and includes at
least six regulatory elements. We identified in the basal promoter a
gamma-activated sequence (GAS) proximal to the transcription start site (base 1),
followed by an IFN regulatory factor 1 response element (IRF-E) and two
CCAATenhancer binding protein beta (CEBPbeta) sites, all of which are essential
for basal promoter activity. Furthermore, GAS and IRF-E were essential for
IFN-gamma-induced transcription. Indeed, sera of IRF-1-deficient mice lacked
basal and IFN-gamma-induced IL-18BP. We found that after induction of IRF-1 by
IFN-gamma, it formed a complex with CEBPbeta, which bound to the IRF-E and
GAS-containing proximal DNA. In contrast, the IFN-gamma-induced signal transducer
and activator of transcription 1 dimer did not associate with this GAS. In
addition, we identified a silencer element and a distal enhancer at bases -1081
to -1272, which was also physically associated with IRF-1. The IRF-1-CEBPbeta
complex described here probably plays a fundamental role in regulating additional
IFN-gamma-responsive genes.

Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

beta(2)-Microglobulin (beta(2)m) is a chaperone of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I (-like) molecules that play a central role in antigen
presentation, immunoglobulin transport, and iron metabolism. It is therefore of
importance that beta(2)m is adequately expressed in cells that perform these
functions, such as hematopoietic cells. In this study, we investigated the
transcriptional regulation of beta(2)m in lymphoid and myeloid cell lines through
a promoter containing a putative E box, Ets/interferon-stimulated response
element (ISRE), and kappa B site. Here we show that upstream stimulatory factor 1
(USF1) and USF2 bind to the E box and regulate beta(2)m transactivation. The
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) subunits p50 and p65 bind to the kappa B box 
and p65 transactivates beta(2)m. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), IRF2,
IRF4, and IRF8, but not PU.1, bind to the Ets/ISRE, and IRF1 and IRF3 are strong 
transactivators of beta(2)m. Together, all 3 boxes are important for the
constitutive and cytokine-induced levels of beta(2)m expression in lymphoid and
myeloid cell types. As such, beta(2)m transactivation is under the control of
important transcriptional pathways, which are activated during injury, infection,
and inflammation.

Polarization of CD4(+) T helper cells toward either a Th1 or Th2 response can
significantly influence host immunity to pathogens. IL-4 and IFN-gamma are the
signature cytokines of Th2 and Th1 cells, respectively. IFN-gamma was shown to
assist Th1 development by promoting IL-12 and IL-12 receptor expression. So far, 
direct influence of Th2 cytokine expression by IFN-gamma has not been described. 
We show here that IFN-gamma directly suppresses IL-4 gene expression. IRF-1 and
IRF-2 induced by IFN-gamma bind to three distinct IL-4 promoter sites and
function as transcriptional repressors. Our data demonstrate a direct negative
feedback of IFN-gamma on expression of the Th2 cytokine gene IL-4 and, thus,
provide evidence for another important mechanism by which IFNgamma assists Th1
and attenuates Th2 responses.

Psoriatic lesional skin exhibits an aberrant expression pattern of interferon
regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2).

Psoriasis is a T-cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. A Th1 cytokine profile 
with increased levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is predominant in skin and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from psoriasis patients. Furthermore, 
psoriatic keratinocytes exhibit an aberrant sensitivity and response to
IFN-gamma. The transcriptional activator interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
plays a crucial role in the activation of IFN-gamma-induced gene expression.
Recently it was shown that mice deficient in IRF-2, a transcriptional repressor
of IFN signalling and thereby acting as an IRF-1 antagonist, display
psoriasis-like skin abnormalities. It was therefore hypothesized that a
dysbalance between IRF-1 and IRF-2, the activator and repressor of IFN responses,
respectively, contributes to the altered IFN-gamma signalling observed in
patients with psoriasis. In the epidermis of patients with psoriasis and healthy 
controls, similar IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA expression levels were observed.
Furthermore, it was not possible to detect any differences in IRF-1 and IRF-2
protein levels in nuclear extracts from the epidermis of controls and psoriasis
patients by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and western blot analysis. Using
double immunofluorescence labelling, it was observed that in normal skin IRF-1
was expressed in keratinocytes throughout the epidermis, whereas IRF-2 was
restricted to the basal cell layer. In psoriatic skin, IRF-1 expression was
comparable to normal skin, whereas IRF-2 was expressed in both basal and
suprabasal cell layers. This altered IRF-2 expression in suprabasal cell layers
may therefore result in a dysbalance between the activator and repressor of IFN
responses in these cell layers, putatively contributing to aberrant responses to 
IFN-gamma and eventually to the psoriatic skin phenotype.

Gamma irradiation-reduced IFN-gamma expression, STAT1 signals, and cell-mediated 
immunity.

The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 is a
cytoplasmic-transcription factor that is phosphorylated by Janus kinases (Jak) in
response to interferon gamma(IFN-gamma). The phosphorylated STAT1 translocates to
the nucleus, where it turns on specific sets of IFN-gamma-inducible genes, such
as the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1. We show here that gamma irradiation 
reduces the IFN-gamma mRNA expression. The inhibition of the STAT1
phosphorylation and the IRF-1 expression by gamma irradiation was also observed. 
In contrast, the mRNA levels of IL-5 and transcription factor GATA-3 were
slightly induced by gamma irradiation when compared to the non-irradiated sample.
Furthermore, we detected the inhibition of cell-mediated immunity by gamma
irradiation in the allogenic-mixed lymphocytes' reaction (MLR). These results
postulate that gamma irradiation induces the polarized-Th2 response and
interferes with STAT1 signals, thereby causing the immunosuppression of the Th1
response.

Molecules that are essential to natural killer (NK) cell development have been
identified mostly through characterizing knock-out mice that exhibit NK
deficiencies. Such studies have shown that the interaction of membrane
lymphotoxin (LT) on NK cells with its receptor on stromal elements is necessary
for inducing a permissive microenvironment for NK development. Also,
transcription factors such as Id2, interferon regulatory factors-1 (IRF-1),
IRF-2, and Ets-1 are indispensable while PU.1 has a somewhat selective role. In
addition, recent studies have identified T/NK progenitors (T/NKPs) in the fetal
liver that precede migration to the fetal thymus as well as the earliest
committed NK precursors in the bone marrow.

OBJECTIVE: Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a critical regulator of
interferon-gamma(IFNgamma)-mediated immune responses. To determine whether IRF-1 
is involved in the pathogenesis of thyroiditis in animal models, we evaluated the
incidence of iodide-induced lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) in non-obese diabetic
(NOD) mice lacking IRF-1 as well as IRF-1 +/+ and +/- mice.
DESIGN: IRF-1 +/+, +/- and -/- NOD mice at 6 weeks of age were fed water (group
1) or iodide water (group 2) for 8 weeks.
METHODS: Thyroids were examined histopathologically and intrathyroidal
lymphocytic infiltration was arbitrarily graded. Serum thyroxine (T(4)) and
anti-mouse thyroglobulin antibody (anti-mTgAb) levels were measured. Spleen cell 
population was analyzed by flow cytometry, and IFNgamma and interleukin-10
produced by splenocytes were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: In group 1, only 4.3% of NOD mice developed LT. In contrast, 67.6% of
mice in group 2 developed the disease. Iodide treatment induced LT in more than
80% of IRF-1 +/+ and +/- mice. However, no IRF-1 -/- mice in group 2 developed
LT. There was no difference in both serum anti-mTgAb and T(4) levels among the
three IRF-1 genotypes of NOD mice. Numbers of splenic CD8(+) T cells and IFNgamma
production by Concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes were markedly decreased in
IRF-1-deficient NOD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF-1 is involved in the development of iodide-induced LT in NOD
mice.

STAT1 is required for IFN-gamma-mediated gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor
expression.

Gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF/KLF4), a member of the Krüppel-like factor
family of transcription factors, has recently been shown to be associated with
growth arrest in the colonic mucosa. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated
that GKLF is one of the down-stream targets of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in
colon cancer cells, but the signaling pathway regulating GKLF expression is not
known. In this report, we showed that IFN-gamma increased GKLF and interferon
regulatory factor-1 mRNA levels in a parallel fashion and these effects were
abolished in STAT1 knockout mouse fibroblast cell lines, indicating that STAT1
mediated IFN-gamma-stimulated GKLF gene expression. IFN-gamma treatment induced
phosphorylation of STAT1 and IFN-gamma-induced GKLF mRNA expression was
attenuated by tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting that phosphorylation
of STAT1 played an essential role in this process. To further evaluate the effect
of STAT1 on GKLF gene expression, a 2622-bp mouse GKLF promoter was isolated from
a liver genomic library. In a transient transfection system, IFN-gamma treatment 
increased GKLF promoter activity by 3.5-fold. Sequential deletion and mutation
analysis of the GKLF promoter has identified the sequence between -1675 and
-1580, a region containing a GAS element, to be essential for IFN-gamma function.
By electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay, nuclear extracts from
IFN-gamma-stimulated HT-29 cells were found to bind to the GAS motif on the GKLF 
promoter and this protein-DNA complex was supershifted by the STAT1 antiserum.
These results indicate that IFN-gamma-induced GKLF expression required
phosphorylated STAT1 and that these effects were mediated, in part, through
interaction of STAT1 with the GAS element on the GKLF promoter.

Virulence criteria for Brucella abortus strains as determined by interferon
regulatory factor 1-deficient mice.

and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706, USA.

Interferon regulatory factor 1-deficient (IRF-1(-/-)) mice infected with virulent
Brucella abortus 2308 at 5 x 10(5) CFU developed acute hepatitis similar to many 
natural hosts but, unlike natural hosts, IRF-1(-/-) mice were unable to resolve
infection and died. In contrast, IRF-1(-/-) mice survived when infected at 5 x
10(5) CFU with several attenuated Brucella strains (S19, RB51, cbp, and cyd). The
survival of infected IRF-1(-/-) mice is likely a function of the level of
virulence of each Brucella strain and the extent of retained immunity. Further,
these findings suggest that adaptive immunity may be important to the survival of
IRF-1(-/-) mice since attenuated Brucella strains can protect IRF-1(-/-) mice
against lethal challenge with virulent Brucella: Using the IRF-1(-/-) mouse
model, the following set of criteria were identified to define Brucella
virulence: (i) the day of death for 50% of mice infected with 5 x 10(5)CFU of
Brucella, (ii) the extent of liver toxicity, and (iii) the minimum immunizing
dose of Brucella to protect against challenge with virulent S2308. Thus,
IRF-1(-/-) mice are important to determining the level of Brucella virulence, to 
evaluating Brucella mutants for attenuation, and to investigating adaptive
immunity in brucellosis.

Complex formation of the interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein with
IRF-1 is essential for murine macrophage IFN-gamma-induced iNOS gene expression.

This study describes the role of the interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding 
protein (ICSBP or IRF-8) in iNOS gene expression by murine macrophages. An ICSBP 
binding site in the iNOS promoter region (-923 to -913) was identified using an
electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin co-immunoprecipitation.
Overexpression of ICSBP greatly enhanced IFN-gamma-induced iNOS promoter
activation in RAW264.7 cells, and IFN-gamma-induced iNOS promoter activation was 
abolished in ICSBP-/- macrophages. Furthermore, transduction of retrovirus-ICSBP 
in ICSBP-/- macrophages rescued IFN-gamma-induced iNOS gene expression. However, 
transduction of retrovirus-ICSBP in the absence of IFN-gamma activation did not
induce iNOS expression in either RAW264.7 cells or ICSBP-/- macrophages.
Interestingly, ICSBP alone transduced into ICSBP-/- macrophages did not bind to
IFN-stimulated response element site (-923 to -913) of the iNOS promoter region, 
although following activation with IFN-gamma, a DNA.protein complex was formed
that contains ICSBP and IRF-1. Co-transduction of ICSBP with IRF-1 clearly
induces nitric oxide production. In addition, interleukin-4 inhibits
IFN-gamma-induced iNOS gene expression by attenuating the physical interaction of
ICSBP with IRF-1. Complex formation of ICSBP with IRF-1 is essential for iNOS
expression, and interleukin-4 attenuates the physical interaction of ICSBP with
IRF-1 resulting in the inhibition of INOS gene expression.

Dysregulation of IFN-gamma signaling pathways in the absence of TGF-beta 1.

Deficiency of TGF-beta1 is associated with immune dysregulation and autoimmunity 
as exemplified by the multifocal inflammatory lesions and early demise of the
TGF-beta1 null mice. Elevated NO metabolites (nitrite and nitrate) in the plasma 
of these mice suggest a participatory role of NO in the pathogenic inflammatory
response. To determine the mechanism for this dysregulation, we examined upstream
elements that could contribute to the overexpression of NO, including inducible
NO synthase (iNOS) and transcription factors Stat1alpha and IFN-regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1). The coincident up-regulation of IFN-gamma, an iNOS inducer, and
iNOS, before the appearance of inflammatory lesions, suggests that failed
regulation of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway may underlie the immunological
disorder in TGF-beta1 null mice. In fact, IFN-gamma-driven transcription factors 
IRF-1 and Stat1alpha, both of which act as transcriptional activators of iNOS,
were elevated in the null mice. Treatment of mice with a polyclonal
anti-IFN-gamma Ab reduced expression and activity not only of transcription
factors Stat1alpha and IRF-1 but also of iNOS. Furthermore, anti-IFN-gamma
treatment delayed the cachexia normally seen in TGF-beta1 null mice and increased
their longevity. The global nature of immune dysregulation in TGF-beta1 null mice
documents TGF-beta1 as an essential immunoregulatory molecule.

Regulation of the IRF-1 tumour modifier during the response to genotoxic stress
involves an ATM-dependent signalling pathway.

The mechanism by which genotoxic stress induces IRF-1 and the signalling
components upstream of this anti-oncogenic transcription factor during the
response to DNA damage are not known. We demonstrate that IRF-1 and the tumour
suppressor protein p53 are coordinately up-regulated during the response to DNA
damage in an ATM-dependent manner. Induction of IRF-1 protein by either ionizing 
radiation (IR) or etoposide occurs through a concerted mechanism involving
increased IRF-1 expression/synthesis and an increase in the half-life of the
IRF-1 protein. A striking defect in the induction of both IRF-1 mRNA and IRF-1
protein was observed in ATM deficient cells. Although ATM deficient cells failed 
to increase IRF-1 in response to genotoxic stress, the induction of IRF-1 in
response to viral mimetics remained intact. Re-expression of the ATM kinase in AT
cells restored the DNA damage inducibility of IRF-1, whilst the PI-3 kinase
inhibitor wortmannin inhibited IRF-1 induction by DNA damage in ATM-positive
cells. The data highlight a role for the ATM kinase in orchestrating the
coordinated induction and transcriptional cooperation of IRF-1 and p53 to
regulate p21 expression. Thus, IRF-1 is controlled by two distinct signalling
pathways; a JAK/STAT-signalling pathway in viral infected cells and an
ATM-signalling pathway in DNA damaged cells.

IRF-8/ICSBP and IRF-1 cooperatively stimulate mouse IL-12 promoter activity in
macrophages.

Diseases, Gakuen 4-7-1, Musashimurayama-shi, Tokyo, Japan. amasumi@nih.go.jp

IRF-8/ICSBP and IRF-1 are IRF family members whose expression is induced in
response to IFN-gamma in macrophages. IL-12 is a cytokine produced in macrophages
that plays a critical role in host defense. IFN-gamma and bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce IL-12p40 transcription, which is necessary for
the production of IL-12. We have previously shown that IL-12p40 expression is
impaired in ICSBP-deficient mice and that transfection of ICSBP together with
IRF-1 can activate IL-12p40 expression in mouse macrophage cells. To further
study the role of ICSBP and IRF-1, we investigated murine IL-12p40 promoter
activity in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. We show here that co-transfection
of ICSBP and IRF-1 synergistically stimulates IL-12 promoter activity to a level 
comparable to that induced by IFN-gamma/LPS. Mutation of the Ets or NFkappaB site
previously shown to be important for IL-12p40 transcription did not abolish the
activation by ICSBP and IRF-1. However, mutation of the ISRE-like site found
downstream from the NFkappaB and C/EBP sites abrogated the activation by ICSBP
and IRF-1. Together, these results indicate that ICSBP and IRF-1 cooperatively
stimulate murine IL-12 transcription through a novel regulatory element in the
murine promoter.

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), a potent cytokine inducing a wide range of
immunologic activities, is increased in the airway secondary to viral infection
or during an inflammatory response. This increase in IFN-gamma concentration may 
alter the expression of specific airway epithelial cell genes that regulate
adaptation of airway inflammatory responses. One protein induced by IFN-gamma is 
Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), which may contribute to the attenuation of
airway inflammation. This study was done to investigate the molecular mechanism
by which IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of the CCSP gene in mouse
transformed Clara cells and transgenic mice. Deletion mapping and linker-scanning
mutations demonstrated that IFN-gamma-induced expression of CCSP was regulated,
in part, at the level of transcription. In vitro and in vivo studies verified
that the minimal IFN-gamma-responsive segment was localized to the proximal 166
bp of the 5'-flanking region. Additionally, IFN-gamma-induced expression of CCSP 
was mediated indirectly through an interferon regulatory factor-1-mediated
increase in hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta.

PIAS3 induces SUMO-1 modification and transcriptional repression of IRF-1.

Nakagawa K(1), Yokosawa H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator that is
involved in interferon response, regulation of cell growth and oncogenesis. To
try to identify the molecules that regulate the function of IRF-1, we performed
yeast two-hybrid screening and isolated protein inhibitor of activated STAT3
(PIAS3) as an IRF-1-binding protein. This protein was also found to bind with
small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9,
an E2 in the SUMO-1-conjugating system. Co-expression of PIAS3 induced SUMO-1
modification of IRF-1 in a RING finger domain-dependent manner and also repressed
transcriptional activity of IRF-1. Thus, PIAS3 functions as a SUMO-1 ligase for
IRF-1 and also as a repressor of IRF-1 transcriptional activity.

Establishment of pregnancy initiates a dynamic and predictable series of changes 
in the uterus. In rodents, the trophectoderm of the blastocyst develops through
the stage of an ectoplacental cone to become the placenta. The inner cell mass
becomes the fetus and its associated extra-embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm.
Maternal changes support development of the conceptus. These begin in the uterine
stroma, which undergoes a process known as decidualization, and progress to
include dilation and elongation of the uteroplacental arteries and activation and
proliferation of specialized large granulated lymphocytes in the decidua basalis.
This review focuses on these pregnancy-associated lymphocytes, known as uterine
Natural Killer (uNK) cells and on their interactions with the other tissues that 
form the mesometrial aspect of the mouse maternal-fetal interface. Analogous
lymphocytes are present in the decidualized human uterus. Understanding of uNK
cell biology has advanced significantly through histological studies of
implantation sites in immune deficient mice. Here, we summarize the key studies
in lymphocyte-, cytokine- and cytokine receptor-deficient mice and in four
enhanced models of gestation in these mice that incorporate transplantation or
therapy with biologically active molecules.

Although biotherapy of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET)
provides excellent control for the hypersecretion syndrome, tumor regression is
rarely observed, implying the need for novel antiproliferative strategies. Here, 
we demonstrate that human pancreatic QGP-1 NET cells express functionally intact 
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptors and downstream effectors, including the
putative tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IFN-gamma
treatment profoundly inhibited anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent
growth of QGP-1 cells. Concomitant with the onset of growth inhibition, apoptotic
cells were detected in cell cycle analyses of IFN-gamma treated cultures.
Apoptosis was confirmed by evaluation of DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage.
Immunoblots of IFN-gamma treated QGP-1 cells revealed a substantial upregulation 
of caspase-1, followed by the appearance of active proteolytic fragments of
caspase-3, suggesting that autocatalytic activation of caspase-1 might initiate
the caspase cascade. Apoptosis induction by IFN-gamma was also observed in two of
four primary cultures established from tumors of patients with for- and midgut
NETs, respectively. Taken together our results characterize IFN-gamma as a potent
proapoptotic stimulus in a subset of gastrointestinal NETs and suggest an IRF-1
mediated induction of caspase-1 as a relevant underlying mechanism. Based on
these results, the potential of IFN-gamma in experimental biotherapeutic
treatment of NETs can be further explored.

Suppression of lipopolysaccharide-induced antiviral transcription factor (STAT-1

Subneutralizing concentrations of antibody may enhance virus infection by
bringing the virus-antibody complex into contact with the cell surface Fc
receptors; this interaction facilitates entry of virus into the cell and is
referred to as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Northern
analysis of macrophage RNA demonstrated that ADE infection by the indigenous
Australian alphavirus Ross River (RRV-ADE) ablated or diminished message for
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric-oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), and IFN 
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), as well as for IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and 
IFN-beta; the transcription of a control gene was unaffected. Additionally,
electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) studies showed that transcription
factor IFN-alpha-activated factor (AAF), IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3),
and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) complex formation in macrophage nuclear
extracts were specifically suppressed post-RRV-ADE infection, emphasizing the
capacity for ADE infections to compromise antiviral responses at the
transcriptional level. The suppression of antiviral transcription factor
complexes was shown to depend on replicating virus and was not simply a result of
general antibody-Fc-receptor interaction. Although only a minority of cells (
approximately 15%) were shown to be positive for RRV by immunostaining techniques
post ADE, molecular (RT-PCR) analysis showed that unstained cells carried
RRV-RNA, indicating a higher level of viral infectivity than previously
suspected. Electron microscopy studies confirmed this observation. Furthermore,
levels of cellular IL-10 protein were dramatically elevated in RRV-ADE cultures. 
This evidence demonstrates that RRV can potently disrupt the activation of
specific antiviral pathways via ADE infection pathways, and may suggest a
significant mechanism in the infection and pathogenesis of other ADE viruses.

Low expression of interferon regulatory factor-1 and identification of novel
exons skipping in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a malignant clonal disorder of the
haematopoietic stem cell. Treatment of CML patients with interferon alpha
(IFN-alpha) has induced haematological and cytogenetic remission. Interferons
transcriptionally activate target genes through the JAK-STAT and interferon
regulated factors (IRFs) family pathways. Interferon regulated factor-1 (IRF-1)
is a transcriptional activator of genes critical for cell growth, differentiation
and apoptosis. The skipping of exons 2 or 2 and 3 of IRF-1 in patients with
myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukaemia suggests that this
factor may have a critical role in leukaemogenesis. The role of IRF-1 in CML is
currently unknown. Therefore, mutational analysis of IRF-1 was performed and its 
expression pattern was also studied in CML patients. We studied IRF-1 in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 21 patients in chronic phase CML. No point 
mutations were identified at the cDNA level. Surprisingly, fourfold reduction of 
full-length IRF-1 mRNA expression was established in 17/21 patients compared with
normal individuals. Low expression of full-length IRF-1 was observed in
conjunction with high levels of aberrantly spliced mRNAs, reported for the first 
time. In three patients who were also analysed during blastic transformation,
further reduction of full-length IRF-1 mRNA was observed. These findings
demonstrate that, in CML patients, IRF-1 can produce high levels of aberrant
spliced mRNAs with subsequent reduction in the levels of full-length IRF-1 mRNA. 
This observation is consistent with the notion that exon skipping may constitute 
another mechanism of tumour suppressor gene inactivation in this disease.

Facial nerve lesions lead to a retrograde response characterized by activation of
glia surrounding axotomized motoneurons and up-regulation of immunological cell
surface molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens.
Cytokines, in particular interferon-gamma, are potent inducers of MHC expression 
and glial activation. We have here tested whether axotomy-induced activation is
changed in transgenic mouse strains lacking components of the IFN-gamma signaling
pathway, STAT4 or STAT6. No differences regarding astrocyte activation,
ss2-microglobulin or MHC class I expression were discernible as compared to wild 
type controls. In contrast, there were conspicuous differences in the reaction
between the examined wild type strains (C57BL/6J, BALB/c and 129/SvJ), suggesting
considerable polymorphisms in the genetic regulation of these events, however,
not involving IFN-gamma, STAT4 or STAT6.

IL-21 up-regulates the expression of genes associated with innate immunity and

IL-21 is a recently characterized T cell-derived cytokine that regulates NK and T
cell function. IL-21R shares the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)) with the receptors
for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Despite the same gamma(c), these cytokines
have different effects on diverse cells. In this study, we have studied IL-15-
and IL-21-induced gene expression in human primary NK and T cells and the NK-92
cell line. Both IL-15 and IL-21 rapidly induced mRNA synthesis for IFN-gamma,
T-bet, IL-2Ralpha, IL-12Rbeta2, IL-18R, and myeloid differentiation factor 88
(MyD88), the genes that are important in activating innate immunity and Th1
response. IL-15 induced STAT5 DNA binding to the IL-2Ralpha IFN-gamma-activated
sequence (GAS), MyD88 GAS, and c-cis-inducible elements, whereas IL-21 induced
STAT3 DNA binding to MyD88 GAS and c-sis-inducible elements. IL-21-induced STAT3 
activation was verified by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with
anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. In addition, pretreatment of NK-92 cells with IL-15 or
IL-21 strongly enhanced IL-12-induced STAT4 DNA binding to IL-2Ralpha GAS. The
induction of IFN-gamma, T-bet, IL-12Rbeta2, and IL-18R gene expression in NK
cells, along with STAT3 activation, suggests that IL-21 is involved in the
activation of innate immune responses. Moreover, the enhanced transcription of
these genes in T cells establishes a significant role for IL-21 also in the Th1
response.

p38 MAPK enhances STAT1-dependent transcription independently of Ser-727
phosphorylation.

The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
(STAT1) requires phosphorylation at both Tyr-701 and Ser-727 for full activation.
IFN-gamma induces phosphorylation of both residues, whereas stress signals like
UV or lipopolysaccharide stimulate phosphorylation of Ser-727 only. Using
p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-deficient cells, we show that
the stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 requires p38alpha MAPK activity,
whereas IFN-gamma-stimulated Ser-727 phosphorylation occurs independently of the 
p38alpha pathway. Consistently, IFN-gamma stimulated expression of the STAT1
target gene IRF1 to a similar extent in both wild-type and p38alpha-deficient
cells. However, stress-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway considerably
enhanced the IFN-gamma-induced expression of both the endogenous IRF1 gene and a 
reporter driven by the IFN-gamma-activated sequence element of the IRF1 promoter.
This enhancement occurred independently of increased phosphorylation of Ser-727
by the p38 pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrate an interaction
between IFN-gamma signaling and the p38 pathway that leads to increased
transcriptional activation by STAT1 independently of phosphorylation at Ser-727.

Suppression of growth by all-trans retinoic acid requires prolonged induction of

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) suppresses growth of cervical dysplasias in vivo, 
although the sensitivity to retinoids is frequently lost during cervical
carcinogenesis. It has been suggested that prolonged treatment or use of higher
doses of retinoids might offer favorable response rates. We found SiHa cervical
squamous carcinoma cells that were virtually resistant to ATRA-induced
growth-inhibitory effects at physiological doses (10(-7 to) 10(-6) M) to be more 
responsive at pharmacological doses (10(-5 to) 10(-4) M). The growth inhibition
by high-dose (10(-4) M) ATRA was associated with a sustained activation of
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), while a low dose (10(-6) M) of ATRA
activated IRF-1 only transiently. Antisense IRF-1 inhibited the high-dose (10(-4)
M), ATRA-mediated growth arrest; forced expression of IRF-1 caused a significant 
reduction in cell growth. High-dose (10(-4) M) ATRA increased binding of
NF-kappaB and STAT1 proteins to sequences that originated from the IRF-1 promoter
region, while low-dose (10(-6) M) ATRA induced only NF-kappaB binding. A delayed 
tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1 (STAT1) was observed after high-dose (10(-4) M) but not low-dose 
(10(-6) M) ATRA treatment. In agreement with this, induction of IRF-1 mRNA by
ATRA was only modest and transient in a STAT1 knockout cell line, suggesting the 
importance of STAT1 in sustained IRF-1 expression. Our data showed that ATRA is
capable of inducing dose-dependent cellular changes, which might be appropriate
to overcome resistance to retinoids that frequently develops during cervical
carcinogenesis.

Type I-interferon signalling in fish.

Author information:

AB24 2TZ, U.K.

Type I interferon (IFN) signalling uses a dual mechanism of action. A Jak-Stat
pathway extensively described in mammals involves a cascade of reactions from the
interaction of the IFN molecule with its membrane receptor to the stimulation of 
IFN-induced gene promoters leading in turn to an antiviral state. Regulation of
IFN activity is also mediated by two DNA-binding transcription factors called
interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and -2, that respectively stimulate and
repress the promoter of IFN-induced genes. By gene walking with trout genomic DNA
the regulatory sequence of the IRF-1 gene was cloned and sequenced. Sequence
analysis showed that this 1 Kb 5' flanking region has a structure which is
typical for an IFN-induced gene promoter. It contains a TATA box between -28 to
-31, and a NF kappa B site between -41 and -52. No complete interferon
stimulatory response element (ISRE) could be found, but ten GAAA motifs, which
are characteristic of IFN-induced gene promoters, were found. In rainbow trout
gonad (RTG) cells, IRF-1 is expressed constitutively and up-regulated by poly I:C
but not by LPS. Transient transfections of RTG cells with a reporter construct
based on the luciferase gene show that the IRF1 5' flanking region described
above, is sufficient to allow the expression of luciferase and is capable of

When cells were incubated in the presence of both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the concentration of IFN-gamma required to
induce apoptosis of B-cell lymphoma cells was much lower than that required for
myeloid or erythroid cell lines. The concentration of IFN-gamma that effectively 
inhibited the proliferation of BALM-3 cells was 1/40 of that required for BALM-1 
cells. STAT-1 phosphorylation, IRF-1 mRNA and protein expression and RAR-beta
expression were enhanced to a greater degree in BALM-3 cells treated with
IFN-gamma and ATRA than in BALM-1 cells treated with IFN-gamma and ATRA,
suggesting that these IFN-gamma related genes were involved in the induction of
apoptosis of BALM-3 cells.

HLA-G transactivation by cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). An
alternative transactivation pathway to the conserved major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I regulatory routes.

The expression of HLA-G in extravillous cytotrophoblast cells coincides with a
general lack of classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
expression in this tissue. This differential expression of HLA-G and classical
HLA class I molecules in trophoblasts suggests a tight transcriptional control of
MHC class I genes. Transactivation of the classical MHC class I genes is mediated
by two groups of juxtaposed cis-acting elements that can be viewed as regulatory 
modules. Both modules are divergent in HLA-G, rendering this gene unresponsive to
NF-kappaB, IRF1, and class II transactivator (CIITA)-mediated induction pathways.
In this study, we searched for alternative regulatory elements in the 1438-bp
HLA-G promoter region. HLA-G was not responsive to interferon-alpha (IFNalpha),
IFNbeta, or IFNgamma, despite the presence of an upstream ISRE binding IRF1 in
vitro. However, the HLA-G promoter contains three CRE/TRE elements with binding
affinity for CREB/ATF and Fos/Jun proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In
transient transfection assays, it was shown that HLA-G transactivation is
regulated by CREB, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and p300. Moreover,
immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that HLA-G is co-expressed with CREB
and CBP in extravillous cytotrophoblasts, revealing the in vivo relevance of this
transactivation pathway. This implies a unique regulation of HLA-G transcription 
among the MHC class I genes.

We have previously shown that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), the active
metabolite of vitamin A, enhances the activation of the inducible nitric oxide
synthase (NOS II) pathway, a component of innate immunity, in rats in vivo. We
investigated the relative contribution of retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha)
and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to NOS II activation triggered by LPS. Five-day
supplementation with 10 mg/kg of either atRA or the RARalpha selective agonist
Ro-40-6055, but not with 10 mg/kg of the pan-RXR agonist Ro-25-7386, enhanced the
LPS-induced NOS II mRNA, protein expression in liver, and plasma nitrite/nitrate 
concentration. Both atRA and the RARalpha agonist (but not the RXR agonist)
increased the number of peripheral T helper lymphocytes and plasma
interferon-gamma concentration. Synergism between retinoids and LPS on NOS II
activation within an organ coincided with synergism on interferon regulatory
factor-1 mRNA expression but not with the level of expression of the RARalpha
protein. These results suggest that, in vivo, atRA activates NOS II through
RARalpha and contributes to characterizing the complex effect of retinoids on the
host inflammatory/immune response.

IL-17 enhances the TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in human colonic
subepithelial myofibroblasts. In this study, we investigated how IL-17 modulates 
RANTES secretion in these cells. TNF-alpha potently induced RANTES secretion, but
IL-17 dose-dependently inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced RANTES secretion. This was
also observed at the mRNA level. Even after pretreatment with TNF-alpha for 12 h,
the inhibitory effect of IL-17 was detectable. IL-17 did not affect the
TNF-alpha-induced stability of the RANTES gene. IL-17 significantly decreased the
TNF-alpha-induced increase in RANTES promoter activity, and IL-17 actually
blocked the TNF-alpha-induced RANTES gene transcription. EMSAs demonstrated that 
IL-17 did not modulate the TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, but 
markedly decreased TNF-alpha-induced IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) DNA-binding 
activity. Because cooperation between NF-kappaB and IRF-1 is important in the
TNF-alpha-induced RANTES gene expression, the major mechanism mediating the
inhibitory effect of IL-17 may be achieved by the inhibition of IRF-1 DNA-binding
activity.

We described the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) promoter single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the clinical and immunologic implications of
these SNPs have been investigated. We successfully determined the mutation at
-300 of the IRF-1 promoter by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and this mutation linked with other mutations in 
the promoter region. In our Japanese population, the frequency of the type
-300*A/A was 11.9%, type A/G was 54.2%, and type G/G was 33.9%. We found no
significant difference without IFN stimulation in the production levels of
IFN-gamma and interleukin-10 (IL-10) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) between subjects with -300*A/A and those with other types. IFN-alpha
stimulation, however, increased the levels of IFN-gamma significantly and
decreased the IL-10 production level significantly only in the subject with
-300*A/A type. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the Th1-type CD4(+) cell
population was significantly increased by IFN-beta administration only in the
patient with chronic hepatitis C with -300*A/A type. These results suggest that
the IRF-1 promoter SNP types are positively involved in Th1-type response and,
consequently, the -300*A/A type may be beneficial for viral elimination in
chronic hepatitis C and IFN therapy.

Low expression of interferon-stimulated genes in active multiple sclerosis is
linked to subnormal phosphorylation of STAT1.

Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated brain disease ameliorated by
interferon-beta therapy. Immune responses to IFN-alpha and IFN-beta are sometimes
subnormal in MS peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs), suggesting an
underlying defect in type I IFN signaling. We studied IFN-beta regulation of mRNA
and protein induction for IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2, which
control multiple IFN-stimulated genes, and for 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase
(2',5'-OAS) and MxA, which are antiviral proteins. First, mRNA levels in resting 
MNC from untreated patients with clinically active MS contained IRF-1 at 38% of
normal controls, 45% for IRF-2, 44% for 2',5'-OAS (all p<0.005), and 46% for MxA 
protein (p<0.007). Stable MS patients had intermediate levels of 2',5'-OAS and
MxA. IFN-beta-1b therapy increased IRF-1, IRF-2, and 2',5'-OAS mRNA in resting
MNC-but only up to levels seen in unstimulated control cells. In untreated
patients with active MS, serine phosphorylation of the STAT1 transcription factor
was markedly reduced, suggesting a mechanism for the low levels of IFN-induced
genes. Secondly, in untreated patients with stable MS, culture with IFN-beta
induced excessive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, and this correlated with low
SHP1 tyrosine phosphatase levels. Excessive P-Tyr-STAT1 responses could induce
inflammatory cytokines and demyelination in MS, as in motheaten mice, which have 
defects in SHP-1 function. Abnormal IFN signaling may predict the course of MS
and responses to therapy.

The rat provides valuable and sometimes unique models of human complex diseases. 
To fully exploit the rat models in biomedical research, it is important to have
access to detailed knowledge of the rat genome organization as well as its
relation to the human genome. Rat Chromosome 10 (RNO10) harbors several important
cancer-related genes. Deletions in the proximal part of RNO10 were repeatedly
found in a rat model for endometrial cancer. To identify functional and
positional candidate genes in the affected region, we used radiation hybrid (RH) 
mapping and single- and dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
techniques to construct a detailed chromosomal map of the proximal part of RNO10.
The regional localization of 14 genes, most of them cancer-related ( Grin2a,
Gspt1, Crebbp, Gfer, Tsc2, Tpsb1, Il9r, Il4, Irf1, Csf2, Sparc, Tp53, Thra1,
Gh1), and of five microsatellite markers ( D10Mit10, D10Rat42, D10Rat50,
D10Rat72, and D10Rat165) was determined on RNO10. For a fifteenth gene, Ppm1b,
which had previously been assigned to RNO10, the map position was corrected to
RNO6q12-q13.

Interferons inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated matrix
metalloproteinase-9 activation via interferon regulatory factor-1 binding
competition with NF-kappa B.

Enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) correlates with
invasion during tumor progression. Interferons (IFNs) inhibit MMP-9 activation in
response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the latter activates the
MMP-9 gene through NF-kappaB. Understanding the molecular basis for MMP-9
inhibition may provide tools to control cell invasion. The data reported here
show the critical role of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) in the inhibition
of MMP-9. (i) IFN treatment suppresses TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 reporter activity 
in STAT1(+/+) cells but not in STAT1(-/-) cells. (ii) IRF1 transfection blocks
TNF-alpha-mediated MMP-9 activation. (iii) IFNs phosphorylate STAT1 and induce
IRF1 but do not affect Ikappa-B degradation nor NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. 
(iv) Nuclear NF-kappaB (p50/p65) and IRF1, but not STAT1, bind to the MMP-9
promoter region containing an IFN-responsive-like element overlapping the
NF-kappaB-binding site. (v) Recombinant IRF1, although unable to bind to an
NF-kappaB consensus sequence, competes with NF-kappaB proteins for binding to the
MMP-9 promoter. (vi) Conversely recombinant p50/p65 proteins reduce IRF1-DNA
binding. (vii) In cells cotransfected with IRF1 and/or p65 expression vectors, an
excess of IRF1 reduces MMP-9 reporter activity, whereas an excess of p65 blocks
the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma. Thus, in contrast to the known synergism
between IRF1 and NF-kappaB, our data identify a novel role for IRF1 as a
competitive inhibitor of NF-kappaB binding to the particular MMP-9 promoter
context.

Many features of the interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling pathway would suggest
that it is anti-tumorigenic. The IFN-gamma signaling pathway leads to apoptosis
and to the expression of immune function proteins that could cooperate with T
cells in the destruction of tumor. Various lines of experimental approach have,
in general, supported the hypothesis that the IFN-gamma signaling pathway is
anti-tumorigenic. However, data also indicate that the idea that the IFN-gamma
signaling pathway is exclusively anti-tumorigenic is too simplistic. Also, to
date, very little of the knowledge regarding the anti-tumor effects of the
IFN-gamma pathway has been useful in the prognosis or therapy of cancer. This
review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the IFN-gamma
signaling pathway in tumorigenesis, with an emphasis on MHC class II induction in
tumor cells and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. The review also
indicates some future areas of investigation that offer hope for applying this
knowledge in reducing cancer mortality.

cytokines.

The expression of antigen presenting MHC class I molecules can be enhanced
through cytokines, e.g. upon infection with bacteria or viruses, either directly 
by enhancing class I gene transcription or by increasing the amounts of accessory
proteins of the loading complex. Tapasin plays a significant role in the peptide 
loading of class I molecules. Here, we describe recognition motifs of cytokine
inducible transcription factors in the promoter region of the mouse tapasin gene,
most of them clustered within the 140 base pairs upstream of the start codon.
Tapasin mRNA was strongly induced in vivo after infection with the facultatively 
intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes in an IFN-gamma-dependent fashion.
Accordingly, both tapasin mRNA and protein were strongly induced in a time and
dose dependent manner in embryonic fibroblasts treated with the cytokines
IFN-gamma and IFN-beta, and weakly induced after treatment with TNF-alpha.
Co-stimulation of tapasin by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma resulted in a weak
synergistic effect. Using fibroblasts either lacking IRF-1 or inhibited in
protein synthesis we show that secondary transcription factors are necessary for 
a maximal stimulation of tapasin expression upon IFN-gamma stimulation. The
sequential induction of TAP1, LMP2, and tapasin before the stimulated expression 
of class I heavy chain is discussed.

Interferon regulatory factor-1, interferon-beta, and reovirus-induced
myocarditis.

State University, Raleigh 27606, USA.

Viral myocarditis is an important human disease, and reovirus-induced myocarditis
in mice provides an excellent model to study direct viral damage to the heart.
Previously, we showed that reovirus induction of and sensitivity to
interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is an important determinant of viral pathogenicity in 
the heart and that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-3
(IRF-3) is required for reovirus induction of IFN-beta in primary cardiac myocyte
cultures. Given several lines of evidence suggesting a possible distinctive
environment for IRFs in the heart, we have now focused on IRF-1. Previous studies
demonstrated that viruses, double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA), and IFN-alpha/beta can
each induce IRF-1 and that IRF-1 plays a role in dsRNA, but perhaps not viral,
induction of IFN-alpha/beta. Importantly, none of these studies used a virus with
a dsRNA genome (such as reovirus), none of them used a highly differentiated
nonlymphoid cell type, and none of them addressed whether viral induction of
IRF-1 is direct or is mediated through viral induction of IFN-beta. Indeed, as
recently as this year it has been assumed that viral induction of IRF-1 is
direct. Here, we found that reovirus induced IRF-1 in primary cardiac myocyte
cultures, but that IRF-1 was not required for reovirus induction of IFN-beta.
Surprisingly, we found that reovirus failed to induce IRF-1 in the absence of the
IFN-alpha/beta response. This provides the first evidence that viruses may not
induce IRF-1 directly. Finally, nonmyocarditic reovirus strains induced more
cardiac lesions in mice deficient for IRF-1 than they did in wildtype mice,
directly demonstrating a protective role for IRF-1. Together, the results
indicate that while IRF-1 is downstream of the IFN-beta response, it plays an
important protective role against viral myocarditis.

Type I IFN regulates different aspects of the immune response, inducing a
cell-mediated immunity. We have recently shown that the infection of dendritic
cells (DC) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induces IFN-alpha. In this work 
we have monitored a rapid induction of IFN-beta followed by the delayed
production of the IFN-alpha1 and/or -alpha13 subtypes. The Mtb infection rapidly 
activates the NF-kappaB complex and stimulates the phosphorylation of IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)-3, events known to induce IFN-beta expression in viral
infection. In turn, the autocrine production of IFN-beta induces the
IFN-stimulated genes that contain binding sites for activated STATs in their
promoters. Among the IFN-stimulated genes induced in DC through STAT activation
are IRF-1 and IRF-7. The expression of IRF-1 appears to be dependent on the
sequential activation of NF-kappaB and STAT-1. Once expressed, IRF-1 may further 
stimulate the transcription of IFN-beta. Induction of IRF-7 is also regulated at 
the transcriptional level through the binding of phosphorylated STAT-1 and
STAT-2, forming the IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 complex. In turn, the IRF-1 and 
IRF-7 expression appears to be required for the delayed induction of the
IFN-alpha1/13 genes. Although correlative, our results strongly support the
existence of a cascade of molecular events in Mtb-infected DC. Upon infection,
constitutively expressed NF-kappaB and IRF-3 are activated and likely contribute 
to the rapid IFN-beta expression. In turn, IFN-beta-induced IRF-1 and IRF-7 may
cooperate toward induction of IFN-alpha1/13 if infection persists and these
factors are activated.

To identify genes associated with survival from antiestrogens, both serial
analysis of geneexpression and gene expression microarrays were used to explore
the transcriptomes of antiestrogen-responsive (MCF7/LCC1) and -resistant
variants(MCF7/LCC9) of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Structure of the 
gene microarray expression data was visualized at the top level using a novel
algorithm that derives the first three principal components,fitted to the
antiestrogen-resistant and -responsive gene expression data, from Fisher's
information matrix. The differential regulation of several candidate genes was
confirmed. Functional studies of the basal expression and endocrine regulation of
transcriptional activation of implicated transcription factors were studied using
promoter-reporter assays. The putative tumor suppressor interferon regulatory
factor-1 is down-regulated in resistant cells, whereas its nucleolar
phosphoprotein inhibitor nucleophosmin is up-regulated. Resistant cells also
up-regulate the transcriptional activation of cyclic AMP response element (CRE)
binding and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) while down-regulating epidermal
growth factor receptor protein expression. Inhibition of NFkappaB activity by ICI
182,780 is lost in resistant cells, but CRE activity is not regulated by ICI
182,780 in either responsive or resistant cells. Parthenolide, a potent and
specific inhibitor of NFkappaB, inhibits the anchorage-dependent proliferation of
antiestrogen-resistant but not antiestrogen-responsive cells. This observation
implies a greater reliance on their increased NFkappaB signaling for
proliferation in cells that have survived prolonged exposure to ICI 182,780.
These data from serial analysis of gene expression and gene microarray studies
implicate changes in a novel signaling pathway, involving interferon regulatory
factor-1, nucleophosmin, NFkappaB, and CRE binding in cell survival after
antiestrogen exposure. Cells can up-regulate some estrogen-responsive genes while
concurrently losing the ability of antiestrogens to regulate their expression.
Signaling pathways that are not regulated by estrogens also can be up-regulated. 
Thus, some breast cancer cells may survive antiestrogen treatment by bypassing
specific growth inhibitory signals induced by antagonist-occupied estrogen
receptors.

In this study, the role of IL-15 and its regulation by the transcription factor
IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in murine V gamma 3 T cell development and
activity is assessed. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, reduced numbers of
mature V gamma 3 cells were found in the fetal thymus of IL-15(-/-) mice, while
IRF-1(-/-) mice displayed normal frequencies. V gamma 3(+) dendritic epidermal T 
cells (DETCs) were absent in IL-15(-/-) mice but present in IRF-1(-/-) mice.
DETCs from IRF-1(-/-) mice displayed morphologically a less mature phenotype and 
showed different emergence kinetics during ontogeny. This corresponded with lower
IL-15 mRNA levels in the skin epidermis. Comparable levels of IL-7 were found in 
the skin of WT and IL-15(-/-) mice. Adoptive transfer experiments of WT fetal
thymocytes into IL-15(-/-) mice did not result in the development of V gamma 3(+)
DETCs, confirming the nonredundant role of IL-15 in the skin during DETC
development. In vitro, cytolytic activity of IL-15(-/-) V gamma 3 cells was
normal after stimulation with IL-15 and was further enhanced by addition of
IL-12. In contrast, cytolytic activity of IRF-1(-/-) V gamma 3 cells remained
defective after stimulation with IL-15 in combination with IL-12. These data
suggest that IL-15 is redundant for the development and/or survival of mature V
gamma 3 cells in the fetal thymus, whereas it is essential for the localization
of V gamma 3 cells in the skin. Furthermore, a possible role for IRF-1 in
inducing morphological maturation of DETCs and cytolytic capacity of V gamma 3
cells is suggested.

IFN-stimulated gene 15 is synergistically activated through interactions between

Type I IFNs cause the induction of a subset of genes termed IFN-stimulated genes 
(ISGs), which harbor a specific DNA element, IFN-stimulated response element
(ISRE). This ISRE confers the responsiveness to the IFN signal through the
binding of a family of transcription factors designated IFN regulatory factors
(IRFs). Some IRFs can bind to the DNA alone, such as IRF-1, which elicits
transcriptional activation, or IRF-2, which leads to transcriptional repression. 
In addition, these factors associate with IRF-8/IFN consensus sequence binding
protein (ICSBP), an immune cell-restricted IRF, and the assembled heterocomplexes
lead to synergistic repression of ISRE elements. ISG15 is a prototype ISG that
contains a well-characterized ISRE. Here we show that PU.1, an ETS member
essential for myeloid/lymphoid cell differentiation, forms heterocomplexes with
the immune-restricted IRFs, IRF-8\/ICSBP and IRF-4, which lead to transcriptional
activation of ISG15. These data allowed the characterization of a subset of ISREs
designated ETS/IRF response element (EIRE), which are differentially regulated in
immune cells. EIREs are unique in their ability to recruit different factors to
an assembled enhanceosomes. In nonimmune cells the factors will mainly include
IRF members, while cell type-restricted factors, such as PU.1, IRF-8\/ICSBP, and 
IRF-4, will be recruited in immune cells. IRF heterocomplex formation leads to
transcriptional repression, and conversely, PU.1/IRFs heterocomplex formation
leads to transcriptional activation. The fact that IRF-8\/ICSBP is an
IFN-gamma-induced factor explains why some of the EIREs are also induced by type 
II IFN. Our results lay the molecular basis for the unique regulation of ISGs,

Kinetics of a gamma interferon response: expression and assembly of CIITA
promoter IV and inhibition by methylation.

Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were employed to assess the kinetics of
transcription factor assembly and histone modifications that occur during gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) induction of CIITA gene expression. CIITA is the master
regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II transcription. Promoter IV
(PIV), the major IFN-gamma responsive promoter for CIITA expression, requires
both STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) for induction by IFN-gamma. STAT1 
binding to PIV was detected first and was accompanied by a modest acetylation of 
histones H3 and H4 that were associated with the region. Despite these changes,
which occurred within 30 min of IFN-gamma treatment, CIITA mRNA was not detected 
until IRF-1 protein was synthesized and bound to its site, a process that
required >120 min. In contrast to these events, fetal trophoblast-like cell
lines, which are refractory to CIITA induction by IFN-gamma, failed to assemble
the above factors or modify their chromatin, suggesting that accessibility to the
promoter is blocked. Bisulfite sequencing of PIV showed strong hypermethylation
of PIV, providing a link between methylation, chromatin structure, and factor
binding. Together, this analysis provides a kinetic view of the activation of the
CIITA gene in response to IFN-gamma and shows that regulatory factor assembly,
chromatin modification, and gene expression proceed in discrete steps.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), IRF-3, and IRF-7 have been tested as
genetic adjuvants for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein
vaccine DNAs. Cotransfection of HA with IRF-3 and IRF-7 increased CD4 T-cell
responses by 2- to 4-fold and CD8 T-cell responses by more than 10-fold.
Following intramuscular deliveries of DNA, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were biased
towards type 1 immune responses and the production of gamma interferon. Following
gene gun bombardments of DNA, both were biased towards type 2 immune responses
and the production of interleukin-4. The biases of the T-cell responses towards
type 1 or type 2 were stronger for immunizations with IRF-3 as an adjuvant than
for immunizations with IRF-7 as an adjuvant. Moderate adjuvant effects for
antibody were observed. The isotypes of the antibody responses reflected the
method of DNA delivery; intramuscular deliveries of DNA predominantly raised
immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a), whereas gene gun deliveries of DNA predominantly
raised IgG1. These biases were enhanced by the codelivered IRFs. Overall, under
the conditions of our experiments, IRF-3 had good activity for T cells, IRF-7 had
good activity for both antibody and T cells, and IRF-1 had good activity for
antibody.

Ascorbate inhibits iNOS expression in endotoxin- and IFN gamma-stimulated rat
skeletal muscle endothelial cells.

Lipopolysaccharide endotoxin and interferon-gamma induced inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) protein expression and nitrite/nitrate formation in microvascular
endothelial cell cultures (ECs) derived from rat skeletal muscle. Pretreatment of
ECs with ascorbate accumulated a large amount of ascorbate inside the cells and
consequently decreased both intracellular oxidant level and iNOS induction. These
effects of ascorbate were abolished in the presence of exogenous superoxide
generated by xanthine oxidase/xanthine plus catalase but were not altered when
N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was applied to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis.
Ascorbate also attenuated the activation of transcription factor IRF-1 but not NF
kappa B. These results indicate that ascorbate inhibits iNOS expression in ECs by
an antioxidant mechanism independent of both NF kappa B activation and the
reported negative feedback effect of nitric oxide.

Direct signal transduction via functional interferon-alphabeta receptors in CD34+
hematopoietic stem cells.

Affinity purified, freshly isolated CD34+ progenitors were shown to express low
levels of type I interferon (IFN) receptors (740 +/- 60 binding sites/cell, K(d) 
0.7 +/- 0.04 nM) determined by Scatchard's analysis using a radiolabelled,
neutralizing, monoclonal antibody directed against the IFNAR1 chain of the human 
type I IFN receptor. Treatment of freshly isolated (day 0), highly purified (>95%
pure) CD34+ cells with recombinant IFN-alpha resulted in rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation and activation of STAT1, Tyk2 and JAK1 as shown by Western
immunoblotting. Similarly, IFN treatment was shown by confocal microscopy to
result in rapid nuclear localization of the transcription factors IRF1 and STAT2,
demonstrating the presence of functional IFN receptors on freshly isolated (day
0) CD34+ cells. The number of specific type I IFN receptor binding sites
expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells increased to some 1440 +/- 40 per
cell after 11 days of cultivation of CD34+ cells in vitrosuggesting that receptor
expression increases with cell differentiation. IFN-mediated signal transduction 
and the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha on 7 or 14 days CFU-GM and BFU-E colony
formation was abrogated in the presence of the anti-IFNAR1 mAb, indicating that
IFN-alpha acts directly on the proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitor
cells via receptor activated signal transduction without excluding the induction 
of other cytokines or growth factors by residual accessory cells.

Prolactin (PRL), a pituitary peptide hormone, is known to regulate diverse
physiological functions via its effects on cellular processes such as
proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. All these activities are
mediated by the PRL receptor (PRL-R), a member of the hematopoietin cytokine
receptor superfamily. To understand PRL-dependent mitogenic signaling in T cells,
we cloned PRL. PRL-R, one mediator of PRL signaling, signal transducer and
activator of transcription (Stat) 5b, and a panel of PRL-inducible immediate
early-response genes from T cells. We are employing one of these PRL-inducible
genes, the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a
multifunctional immune regulator gene, as a tool to understand how PRL modulates 
T-cell proliferative responses. In investigating regulatory events along the
PRL-R/Janus activating kinase (JAK)/Stat/IRF-1 signaling pathway, we show that
Stat factors can activate as well as inhibit IRF-1 promoter activity and that
cross talk between Stat and nuclear factor (NF)kappaB signaling pathways also
regulates IRF-1 expression. In understanding how signaling pathways cross talk at
the IRF-1 promoter, we obtained insights into how PRL can modulate immune and
inflammatory responses. These findings have much broader implications, not only
for cells in the immune system but also for other PRL-responsive cells and
tissues.

Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is controlled by the
cooperation of virally encoded and host regulatory proteins. The Tat protein is
essential for viral replication, however, expression of Tat after virus entry
requires HIV-1 promoter activation. A sequence in the 5' HIV-1 LTR, containing a 
binding site for transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF)
family has been suggested to be critical for HIV-1 transcription and replication.
Here we show that IRF-1 activates HIV-1 LTR transcription in a dose-dependent
fashion and in the absence of Tat. This has biological significance since IRF-1
is produced early upon virus entry, both in cell lines and in primary CD4+ T
cells, and before expression of Tat. IRF-1 also cooperates with Tat in amplifying
virus gene transcription and replication. This cooperation depends upon a
physical interaction that is blocked by overexpression of IRF-8, the natural
repressor of IRF-1, and, in turn is released by overexpression of IRF-1. These
data suggest a key role of IRF-1 in the early phase of viral replication and/or
during viral reactivation from latency, when viral transactivators are absent or 
present at very low levels, and suggest that the interplay between IRF-1 and
IRF-8 may play a key role in virus latency.

The IFN-gamma-induced HLA class II expression in human macrophages was
drastically reduced after phagocytosis of Escherichia coli. HLA class II
down-modulation depended on phagocytosis of bacteria and could not be reproduced 
by phagocytosis of inert particles or by treatment with lipopolysaccharide. Study
of the kinetics and molecular analysis showed that class II molecules and
corresponding mRNA were up-regulated at 6 h after phagocytosis of bacteria.
Subsequently, a progressive reduction of mRNA occurred, and, at 72 h, as little
as 25% of the class II mRNA level of IFN-gamma-treated control cells was found.
This was due to reduced transcription of the class II transcriptional activator
CIITA, as a consequence of reduced immediate-early inducible factor (IRF-1) and
particularly of reduced phosphorylated Stat-1 homodimers, nuclear factors both
necessary for optimal triggering of the CIITA promoter. Failure to sustain
IFN-gamma-induced CIITA up-modulation during phagocytosis of bacteria had
functional implications, as human macrophages could not adequately process and
present antigenic peptides to HLA-DR-restricted antigen-specific T cells. This is
the first evidence that phagocytosis of bacteria can down-modulate HLA class II
expression in normal human macrophages by acting at the level of expression of
CIITA.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), associated with bronchiolitis and asthma, is
resistant to the antiviral effects of type-I interferons (IFN), but not
IFN-gamma. However, the antiviral mechanism of IFN-gamma action against RSV
infection is unknown. The molecular mechanism of IFN-gamma-induced antiviral
activity was examined in this study using human epithelial cell lines HEp-2 and
A549. Exposure of these cells to 100-1000 units/ml of IFN-gamma, either before or
after RSV infection, results in a significant decrease in RSV infection. After 1 
h of exposure, IFN-gamma induces protein expression of IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) but not IRF-2, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, and
inducible nitric-oxide synthase in these cells. The mRNA for IRF-1, p40, and p69 
isoforms of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 AS) are detectable,
respectively, at 1 and 4 h of IFN-gamma exposure. Studies using cycloheximide and
antisense oligonucleotides to IRF-1 indicate a direct role of IRF-1 in activating
2-5 AS. Cells transfected with 2-5 AS antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the
antiviral effect of IFN-gamma. A stable cell line of HEp-2 overexpressing RNase L
inhibitor, RLI-14, which exhibits an IFN-gamma-induced gene expression pattern
similar to that of the parent cell line, shows a significant reduction in RNase L
activity and IFN-gamma-mediated antiviral effect, compared with HEp-2 cells.
These results provide direct evidence of the involvement of 2-5 AS in
IFN-gamma-mediated antiviral activity in these cells.

The class II tumour suppressor gene H-REV107-1 is a target of
interferon-regulatory factor-1 and is involved in IFNgamma-induced cell death in 
human ovarian carcinoma cells.

H-rev107-1 is a growth inhibitory RAS target gene capable of suppressing
anchorage independent growth in vitro and in vivo. Using a tumour tissue array
with 241 matched tumour and normal tissue cDNA pools, we found down-regulation of
H-REV107-1 in 7 out of 14 ovary-derived cDNAs. RT-PCR analysis and
immunohistochemical investigation confirmed expression of H-REV107-1 in normal
ovarian epithelial cells but down-regulation in high grade ovarian carcinomas.
H-REV107-1 is also strongly expressed in immortalized rat and human ovarian
epithelial cells in vitro, but suppressed in transformed cells by two different
mechanisms. KRAS-transformed rat ovarian cells and PA1 teratocarcinoma cells,
reversibly repress H-REV107-1 via MAP/ERK signaling. In contrast, treatment of
A27/80 and OVCAR-3 epithelial ovarian cancer cells with IFNgamma stimulated
H-REV107-1 expression. In NIH3T3 cells harbouring an estrogen-inducible IRF-1,
H-rev107-1 is directly induced after activation of IRF-1, indicating that
H-rev107-1 is a target of IRF-1. Stimulation of H-REV107-1 expression was also
observed in ovarian epithelial cells suggesting that IRF-1 is involved in
H-REV107-1 regulation in human ovarian epithelium. In the IFNgamma-sensitive cell
line A27/80, H-REV107-1 suppresses colony formation. A27/80 and OVCAR-3 cells
overexpressing H-REV107-1 protein underwent apoptosis. These results demonstrate 
down-regulation of the class II tumour suppressor H-REV107-1 in human ovarian
carcinomas and suggest an involvement of H-REV107-1 in interferon-dependent cell 
death.

An interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)/interferon regulatory element
(IRE) spanning nucleotide coordinates 1091-1100 is present in the enhancer 1/X
gene promoter region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome. In the context of a
minimal promoter element, the enhancer 1/X gene promoter ISRE/IRE was shown to be
a functional regulatory site capable of mediating interferon alpha- (IFNalpha)
and interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-specific transcriptional
activation in transient transfection analysis. The enhancer 1/X gene promoter
ISRE/IRE was also shown to mediate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 and IRF7 
activation of transcription from a minimal promoter construct. In contrast,
IFNalpha and the IRFs had minimal effect on HBV transcription and replication in 
the context of the viral genome in cell culture.

In the past few years, many nuclear receptor coactivators have been identified
and shown to be an integral part of receptor action. The most frequently studied 
of these coactivators are members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)
family, SRC-1, TIF2/GRIP1/SRC-2, and pCIP/ACTR/AIB-1/RAC-3/TRAM-1/SRC-3. In this 
report, we describe the biochemical purification of SRC-1 and SRC-3 protein
complexes and the subsequent identification of their associated proteins by mass 
spectrometry. Surprisingly, we found association of SRC-3, but not SRC-1, with
the I kappa B kinase (IKK). IKK is known to be responsible for the degradation of
I kappa B and the subsequent activation of NF-kappa B. Since NF-kappa B plays a
key role in host immunity and inflammatory responses, we therefore investigated
the significance of the SRC-3-IKK complex. We demonstrated that SRC-3 was able to
enhance NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression in concert with IKK. In addition, we 
showed that SRC-3 was phosphorylated by the IKK complex in vitro. Furthermore,
elevated SRC-3 phosphorylation in vivo and translocation of SRC-3 from cytoplasm 
to nucleus in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha occurred in cells,
suggesting control of subcellular localization of SRC-3 by phosphorylation.
Finally, the hypothesis that SRC-3 is involved in NF-kappa B-mediated gene
expression is further supported by the reduced expression of interferon
regulatory factor 1, a well-known NF-kappa B target gene, in the spleens of SRC-3
null mutant mice. Taken together, our results not only reveal the IKK-mediated
phosphorylation of SRC-3 to be a regulated event that plays an important role but
also substantiate the role of SRC-3 in multiple signaling pathways.

IFN regulatory factor-1 regulates IFN-gamma-dependent cathepsin S expression.

Santambrogio L, Silverman ES, Riese RJ.

School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Cathepsin S is a cysteine protease with potent endoproteolytic activity and a
broad pH profile. Cathepsin S activity is essential for complete processing of
the MHC class II-associated invariant chain within B cells and dendritic cells,
and may also be important in extracellular matrix degradation in atherosclerosis 
and emphysema. Unique among cysteine proteases, cathepsin S activity is
up-regulated by IFN-gamma. Given its importance, we sought to elucidate the
pathway by which IFN-gamma increases cathepsin S expression. Our data demonstrate
that the cathepsin S promoter contains an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) 
that is critical for IFN-gamma-induced gene transcription in a cell line derived 
from type II alveolar epithelial (A549) cells. IFN response factor (IRF)-2
derived from A549 nuclear extracts associates with the ISRE oligonucleotide in
gel shift assays, but is quickly replaced by IRF-1 following stimulation with
IFN-gamma. The time course of IRF-1/ISRE complex formation correlates with
increased levels of IRF-1 protein and cathepsin S mRNA. Overexpression of IRF-1, 
but not IRF-2, markedly augments cathepsin S promoter activity in A549 cells.
Furthermore, overexpression of IRF-1 increases endogenous cathepsin S mRNA levels
in 293T epithelial cells. Finally, freshly isolated bone marrow cells from
IRF-1(-/-) mice fail to up-regulate cathepsin S activity in response to
IFN-gamma. Thus, IRF-1 is the critical transcriptional mediator of
IFN-gamma-dependent cathepsin S activation. These data elucidate a new pathway by
which IRF-1 may affect MHC class II processing and presentation.

Transcription factor IRF-1 in kidney transplants mediates resistance to graft
necrosis during rejection.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Immunology, and Department 
of Surgery, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

In many circumstances kidney transplants remain viable despite extensive
inflammation, permitting rejection episodes to be reversed. The mechanisms by
which the kidney resists host effector mechanisms are not known. In mouse kidney 
transplants, resistance requires interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which acts on the 
graft to protect the graft from necrosis during the first days of rejection as
well as inducing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression. Because some 
effects of IFN-gamma are mediated by transcription factor IRF-1, the role of
IRF-1 in the donor tissue early phases of rejection of mouse kidney allografts
was studied. H-2(b) kidneys were transplanted from mice with wild-type IRF-1
genes (WT) or mice with disrupted IRF-1 genes (IRF-1KO) into CBA (H-2(k))
recipients. At day 5 and day 7, IRF-1KO and WT kidneys were functioning despite
typical rejection pathology: interstitial infiltration and tubulitis. However,
function deteriorated rapidly in rejecting IRF-1KO allografts, associated with
widespread epithelial necrosis, peritubular capillary congestion, glomerulitis,
and fibrin thrombi in small veins by day 7. At day 21, WT kidneys were viable
despite severe tubulitis and arteritis, whereas IRF-1KO kidneys showed massive
necrosis of the epithelium despite patent large vessels. Compared with WT
kidneys, rejecting IRF-1KO kidneys showed less induction of donor MHC yet had
similar mRNA levels of perforin, granzyme B, and Fas ligand and evoked host
alloantibody responses. Thus in rejecting kidney transplants, IRF-1 in the graft 
mediates MHC induction, but it also mediates resistance to necrosis, an effect
that could be crucial to permit success in interventions against rejection.

In this study we examined the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication
on the innate antiviral response of the host cell. Replication of an HCV
subgenomic replicon stimulated the activation of the interferon (IFN)-beta
promoter and the production of IFN in human hepatoma cells. Using a variety of
functional assays, we found that HCV RNA replication induced the activation and
DNA-binding activity of NFkappaB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1. In
addition, microscopy experiments revealed a higher frequency of cells containing 
the nuclear-localized, active form of IRF-3 in HCV replicon cultures versus
control cultures. Consistent with these observations, cells harboring the HCV
replicon exhibited high basal level expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated
antiviral genes. Our results indicate that HCV RNA replication can stimulate
cellular antiviral programs that contribute to the assembly and activation of the
IFN-beta enhanceosome complex and initiation of the antiviral state. Stable HCV
RNA replication in the face of the host antiviral response suggests that HCV may 
encode one or more proteins capable of overcoming specific antiviral processes,
thereby supporting persistent infection.

Reovirus-induced murine myocarditis provides an excellent model for the human
disease. Cardiac tissue damage varies between reovirus strains, and is caused by 
a direct viral cytopathogenic effect. One determinant of virus-induced cardiac
tissue damage is the cardiac interferon-beta (IFN-beta) response to viral
infection. Nonmyocarditic reoviruses induce more IFN-beta and/or are more
sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-beta in cardiac cells than myocarditis 
reoviruses. The roles of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) in the cardiac
response to viral infection are reviewed, and results suggest possible
cardiac-specific variations in IRF-3 and IRF-1 function. In addition, data are
presented indicating that the role of IRF-2 in regulation of IFN-beta expression 
is cell type-specific and differs between skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.
Together, results suggest that the heart may provide a unique environment for IRF
function, critical for protection against virus-induced cardiac damage.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 mediates interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis in
ovarian carcinoma cells.

Kim EJ(1), Lee JM, Namkoong SE, Um SJ, Park JS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Bioscience, Graduate School, Catholic University, Seoul,
Korea.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as one of interferon family that regulates
antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory responses, has been implicated
for the growth regulation of ovarian cancer cells. However, the molecular
mechanisms are not yet fully defined. To analyze detailed mechanisms, the ovarian
cancer cell lines (2774, PA-1, OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3) were treated with IFN-gamma. 
The growth of 2774 was most effectively suppressed than that of other cells in
both time-course and dose-dependent experiments. The order of sensitivity in
other cells was PA-1 >> OVCAR-3 > SKOV-3 (not responded at all). The DNA
fragmentation and DAPI staining assays suggested that the IFN-gamma-mediated
cytotoxicity could be triggered by apoptosis. The treatment induced IFN
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in two IFN-gamma-sensitive cells (2774, PA-1),
whereas IRF-1 was not induced in two IFN-gamma-resistant cells (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3).
The levels of p53 and p21WAF1 were not strikingly changed in all four cells.
Interestingly, the expression of interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE, or
caspase-1) was increased by the treatment in a kinetically consistent manner to
the induction of IRF-1. However, CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was not changed. Apoptosis was 
greatly induced, when IRF-1 was transiently expressed in PA-1 without the
treatment of IFN-gamma. However, it was repressed when IRF-1 together with IRF-2,
an antagonist of IRF-1, were coexpressed. In addition, the effect of IFN-gamma
was reduced in the 2774 and PA-1 cells stably expressing either IRF-1 antisense
or IRF-2 sense, as shown by the cytotoxicity and FACS analysis. Furthermore, the 
IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis was greatly reduced, when inhibitors of ICE were
treated into PA-1 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that IRF-1
directly mediates the IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis via the activation of caspase-1
gene expression in IFN-gamma-sensitive ovarian cancer cells.

Resistance of tumors to cytotoxic therapy may be due to disrupted apoptosis
programs and remains a major obstacle in cancer treatment. Here, we report that
IFNgamma sensitizes resistant tumor cells with absent or low caspase-8 expression
for apoptosis induced by death-inducing ligands or cytotoxic drugs by
upregulating caspase-8 through a Stat1/IRF1 dependent pathway. Combined treatment
using IFNgamma with TRAIL, APO1, TNFalpha or cytotoxic drugs cooperated to
trigger apoptosis in various resistant tumor cell lines derived from Ewing tumor,
neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma, while single agents exerted only a minimal
effect. Importantly, IFNgamma induced caspase-8 expression also in cells with
inactivation of the caspase-8 gene by hypermethylation, although no direct effect
of IFNgamma on the methylation status of regulatory sequences of the caspase-8
gene was found. IFNgamma-mediated facilitation of apoptosis was inhibited by the 
caspase-8 specific inhibitor zIETD.fmk or in caspase-8 mutant Jurkat cells
implying a prominent role of caspase-8 in mediating sensitization by IFNgamma.
Upregulation of caspase-8 and sensitization for apoptosis by IFNgamma was blocked
by overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of Stat1 or in Stat1-deficient U3A
cells, while complementation of Stat1-deficient U3A cells with wild-type Stat1
restored the IFNgamma effect. Moreover, ectopic expression of IRF1 induced
caspase-8 expression thereby sensitizing cells for TRAIL-, APO1- or
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These findings provide evidence that the
Stat1/IRF1 pathway is involved in induction of caspase-8 expression and apoptosis
initiated by IFNgamma and indicate that IFNgamma might be an effective strategy
to sensitize various resistant tumor cells with deficient caspase-8 expression
for chemotherapy- or death receptor-induced apoptosis.

Host defense responses to infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Induction of
IRF-1 and a serine protease inhibitor.

Alveolar macrophages and newly recruited monocytes are targets of infection by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, we examined the expression of interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), which plays an important role in host defense
against M. tuberculosis, in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Infection 
induced IRF-1 in both. IRF-1 from undifferentiated, uninfected monocytic cell
lines was modified during extraction to produce specific species that were
apparently smaller than intact IRF-1. After infection by M. tuberculosis or
differentiation, intact IRF-1 was recovered. Subcellular fractions were assayed
for the ability to modify IRF-1 or inhibit its modification. A serine protease on
the cytoplasmic surface of an organelle or vesicle in the
"lysosomal/mitochondrial" fraction from undifferentiated cells was responsible
for the modification of IRF-1. Thus, the simplest explanation of the modification
is cleavage of IRF-1 by the serine protease. Recovery of intact IRF-1 correlated 
with induction of a serine protease inhibitor that was able to significantly
reduce the modification of IRF-1. The inhibitor was present in the cytoplasm of
M. tuberculosis-infected or -differentiated cells. It is likely that induction of
both IRF-1 and the serine protease inhibitor in response to infection by M.
tuberculosis represent host defense mechanisms.

Angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor is developmentally regulated and exerts
antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions. Genetic ablation of this receptor in 
mice affects regulation of blood pressure, but the involvement of the AT2
receptor in the pathogenesis of hypertension remains unknown. In the present
study, we examined developmental changes of angiotensin receptor subtypes in the 
kidney of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), and compared them
with those in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We also investigated the
regulation and functional role of the AT2 receptor in cultured mesangial cells.
Receptor binding and Northern blot analyses revealed that AT2 receptor expression
is significantly lower in the SHRSP kidney than in the WKY kidney during the
perinatal period, while AT1 receptor expression is not different between them. In
WKY mesangial cells, AT2 receptor stimulation exerted a potent antiproliferative 
effect; this effect was not observed in SHRSP cells lacking the AT2 receptor
expression. The expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 paralleled the
growth-dependent induction of AT2 receptor in WKY mesangial cells, and
transfection of IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide significantly suppressed AT2
receptor expression, indicating IRF-1-dependent regulation of AT2 receptor
expression in mesangial cells. However, this induction was inefficient in SHRSP
cells. Thus, we found impaired AT2 receptor expression in the SHRSP kidney in
vivo and in mesangial cells in vitro. The unbalanced expression of renal
angiotensin receptor subtypes with exaggerated AT1 receptor signaling during
early life in SHRSP may play a role in the programming for hypertension and
related renal injury.

The transcription factor STAT1 plays a pivotal role in signal transduction of
type I and II interferons (IFNs). STAT1 activation leads to changes in expression
of key regulatory genes encoding caspases and cell cycle inhibitors. Deficient
STAT1 expression in human cancer cells and virally mediated inhibition of STAT1
function have been associated with cellular resistance to IFNs and mycobacterial 
infection in humans. Thus, given the relative importance of STAT1, we isolated
and characterized a human STAT1 intronic enhancer region displaying IFN-regulated
activity. Functional analyses by transient expression identified a repressor
region and type I and II IFN-inducible elements within the STAT1 enhancer
sequence. A candidate IRF-E/GAS/IRF-E (IGI) sequence containing GAAANN nucleotide
repeats was shown by gel shift assay to bind to IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), 
but not to IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) or STAT1-3. An additional larger
IGI-binding complex containing IRF-1 was identified. Mutation of the GAAANN
repeats within the IGI DNA element eliminated IRF-1 binding and the IFN-regulated
activity of the STAT1 intronic enhancer region. Transfection of the IFN-resistant
MM96 cell line to express increased levels of IRF-1 protein also elevated STAT1, 
STAT2, and p48/IRF-9 expression and enhanced cellular responsiveness to IFN-beta.
Reciprocating regulation between IRF-1 and STAT1 genes and encoded proteins
indicates that an intracellular amplifier circuit exists controlling cellular
responsiveness to the IFNs.

University, Seoul, South Korea

We have previously reported that human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 interacts with
IRF-1, a key regulator of cellular immune response, and abrogates its
transactivation function at the molecular level in vitro. To confirm our previous
data, we investigated in vivo the E7-mediated down-regulation of IRF-1 using HPV 
E7-inducible cells and transgenic mice expressing HPV-18 E6/E7. When E7 was
induced in the absence of tetracycline, the expression of target genes of IRF-1
(TAP-1, IFN-beta, MCP-1 that are important for cellular immunity) was clearly
reduced as determined by RT-PCR. In addition, the IRF-1 activity was
down-regulated in E7-expressing cells into which IFN-beta-CAT reporter plasmid
was transfected. To further investigate the E7-mediated immune regulation in
vivo, we constructed transgenic mice expressing E6 and E7 genes of HPV-18 under
the control of HPV-18 promoter (URR). From several rounds of breeding, we
obtained from a transgenic line that developed a cervical dysplasia and expressed
E6/E7 as determined by histological examination and RT-PCR, respectively.
Subsequent RT-PCR analysis indicated that TAP-1, IFN-beta, and MCP-1 genes were
less expressed in a cervical tissue derived from transgenic mouse, when compared 
with a cervix derived from normal mouse. From these results, we conclude that the
E7 transgene expression inactivates the transactivation function of IRF-1 in
vivo, which might be important for the elucidation of the E7-mediated immune
evading mechanism that is frequently found in cervical cancer.

Activation of type II alveolar epithelial cells during acute endotoxemia.

Lung injury induced by acute endotoxemia is associated with increased generation 
of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and eicosanoids, which have been
implicated in the pathophysiological process. Although production of these
mediators by alveolar macrophages (AM) has been characterized, the response of
type II cells is unknown and was assessed in the present studies. Acute
endotoxemia caused a rapid (within 1 h) and prolonged (up to 48 h) induction of
nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) in type II cells but a delayed response in AM
(12-24 h). In both cell types, this was associated with increased nitric oxide
production. Although type II cells, and to a lesser extent AM, constitutively
expressed cyclooxygenase-2, acute endotoxemia did not alter this activity.
Endotoxin administration had no effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase or
protein kinase B-alpha (PKB-alpha) expression. However, increases in
phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phospho-PKB-alpha were observed in type II cells.
The finding that this was delayed for 12-24 h suggests that these proteins do not
play a significant role in the regulation of NOS-2 in this model. After endotoxin
administration to rats, a rapid (within 1-2 h) activation of nuclear
factor-kappaB was observed. This response was transient in type II cells but was 
sustained in AM. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was also activated
rapidly in type II cells. In contrast, IRF-1 activation was delayed in AM. These 
data demonstrate that type II cells, like AM, are highly responsive during acute 
endotoxemia and may contribute to pulmonary inflammation.

Low responsiveness to IFN-gamma, after pretreatment of mouse macrophages with
lipopolysaccharides, develops via diverse regulatory pathways.

Crespo A(1), Filla MB, Murphy WJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto
(IPATIMUP), Porto, Portugal.

We have investigated the mechanisms by which prior exposure of mouse macrophages 
to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induces a state of low responsiveness to subsequent 
exposure to IFN-gamma. We demonstrate that induction of this state requires both 
de novo gene expression and the suppression of phosphorylation events that lead
to activation of transcription factor Stat1 alpha. These observations are
mechanistically consistent with the known induction of suppressors of cytokine
signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 proteins by LPS. In this regard, we demonstrate
that overexpression of either SOCS protein suppresses induction of the mouse
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene promoter: apparently by suppressing
interactions between Stat1 alpha and IFN-gamma activated sites present in both
the iNOS, and interferon regulatory factor-1, gene promoters. The induction of
SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 by LPS or IFN-beta (an autocrine/paracrine mediator of
LPS-induced SOCS-1 mRNA synthesis)occurs by way of multiple protein kinase
pathways that include protein tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, and
mitogen-activated protein kinases. These results provide insight that may allow
discrimination between LPS-induced inhibition of macrophage functions that are
detrimental to the host (e.g. continued exposure to LPS) versus those that might 
potentially be beneficial (e.g. exposure to subsequent agonists that induce more 
specific macrophage functions).

Four transacting genes, CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP, control coordinate MHC II
expression. In humans, defects in these genes result in the absence of MHC II
expression and thus a combined immunodeficiency. CIITA is considered to be a
master MHC II regulator and is responsible for the defect in complementation
group A. Eight such affected families have been reported. We investigated the
molecular basis of the defect in three patients in these families, all presenting
a severe immunodeficiency. CIITA transcripts were detected in all three patients 
but in one at an abnormally low level. Three novel heterozygous mutations of
CIITA were found in patients SP and RC. One SP CIITA allele contained a nonsense 
mutation, G2178A, leading to a premature stop codon and the other allele in SP
was found not to be expressed. In patient RC, two in-frame deletions were
detected: one of the nucleotides 3003-3084 corresponding to the exon coding from 
Leu(964)to Asp(991), in the paternal allele, and a CATdel3193-5 of the isoleucine
codon at position 1027, in the maternal allele. Transfection of a CIITA-deficient
cell line with the recombinant CATdel3193-5-CIITA cDNA revealed a loss of
function for this mutant and retention of the protein in the cytoplasm. No
mutations were detected in the 4.5-kb cDNA from patient OK but the level of CIITA
transcript was found to be profoundly decreased. However, promoters III and IV
were not affected. This last case represents the first described CIITA
dysfunction due to putative mutation(s) in cis regulatory sequences of CIITA.

We previously showed that the intrahepatic induction of cytokines such as
alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) inhibits 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication noncytopathically in the livers of transgenic
mice. The intracellular pathway(s) responsible for this effect is still poorly
understood. To identify interferon (IFN)-inducible intracellular genes that could
play a role in our system, we crossed HBV transgenic mice with mice deficient in 
IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase
(PKR), or RNase L (RNase L) (IRF-1(-/-), PKR(-/-), or RNase L(-/-) mice,
respectively), three well-characterized IFN-inducible genes that mediate
antiviral activity. We showed that unmanipulated IRF-1(-/-) or PKR(-/-)
transgenic mice replicate HBV in the liver at slightly higher levels than the
respective controls, suggesting that both IRF-1 and PKR individually appear to
mediate signals that modulate HBV replication under basal conditions. These same 
animals were responsive to the antiviral effects of the IFN-alpha/beta inducer
poly(I-C) or recombinant murine IFN-gamma, suggesting that under these
conditions, either the IRF-1 or the PKR genes can mediate the antiviral activity 
of the IFNs or other IFN-inducible genes mediate the antiviral effects. Finally, 
RNase L(-/-) transgenic mice were undistinguishable from controls under basal
conditions and after poly(I-C) or IFN-gamma administration, suggesting that RNase
L does not modulate HBV replication in this model.

Susceptibility of IFN regulatory factor-1 and IFN consensus sequence binding
protein-deficient mice to brucellosis.

Ko J(1), Gendron-Fitzpatrick A, Splitter GA.

and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

IFN-gamma is a key cytokine controlling Brucella infection, and the diverse
functions of this cytokine are mediated by IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) such as 
IRF-1, IRF-2, and IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP). However, the
roles of these three IRFs in Brucella infection have not been investigated. The
infection of each IRF-deficient mouse strain provides an opportunity to determine
not only the significance of each IRF molecule but also the crucial immune
components necessary for host defense during in vivo infection, because
respective IRF-deficient mouse strains contain unique immunodeficient phenotypes.
Brucella abortus S2308-infected IRF-1-/- mice were dead within 2 wk
postinfection, while IRF-2-/- mice contained less splenic Brucella CFU than
wild-type mice at the early stage of infection. Infected ICSBP-/- mice maintained
a plateau of splenic Brucella CFU throughout the infection. Additional infection 
of IL-12p40-, NO synthase 2-, and gp91(phox)-deficient mice indicates that these 
immune components are crucial for Brucella immunity and may contribute to the
susceptibility of IRF-1-/- and ICSBP-/- mice. Immunologic and histopathological
analyses of infected IRF-1-/- mice indicate that the absence of IL-12p40
induction and serious hepatic damage are involved in the death of IRF-1-/- mice. 
These results indicate that 1) IRF-1 and ICSBP are essential transcriptional
factors for IFN-gamma-mediated protection against Brucella; 2) IL-12, reactive
nitrogen intermediates, and reactive oxygen intermediates are crucial immune
components against Brucella, and their absence may contribute to the
susceptibility of IRF-1-/- and ICSBP-/- mice; and 3) hepatic damage caused by
Brucella virulence contributes to the death of IRF-1-/- mice.

Chronic pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common in cystic
fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phosholipase C
(PLC), and exotoxin A (ETA) were evaluated for their ability to induce pulmonary 
inflammation in mice following intranasal inoculation. Both LPS and PLC induced
high levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 
beta-6, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), MIP-1 alpha MIP-2 in the lungs but did not 
affect IL-18 levels. ETA did not induce TNF-alpha and was a weak inducer of IL-1 
beta, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), and MIP-2.
Remarkably, ETA reduced constitutive lung IL-18 levels. LPS was the only factor
inducing IFN-gamma. LPS, PLC, and ETA all induced cell infiltration in the lungs.
The role of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in pulmonary inflammation
induced by LPS, PLC, and ETA was evaluated. When inoculated with LPS, IRF-1 gene 
knockout (IRF-1 KO) mice produced lower levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and
IFN-gamma than did wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, a milder effect of ETA on IL-1
beta and IL-18 was observed for IRF-1 KO than for WT mice. In contrast, the
cytokine response to PLC did not differ between WT and IRF-1 KO mice.
Accordingly, LPS and ETA, but not PLC, induced expression of IRF-1 mRNA. IRF-1
deficiency had no effect on MIP-1 alpha and MIP-2 levels and on cell infiltration
induced by LPS, PLC, or ETA. Flow cytometric evaluation of lung mononuclear cells
revealed strongly reduced percentages of CD8(+) and NK cells in IRF-1 KO mice
compared to percentages observed for WT mice. These data indicate that different 
virulence factors from P. aeruginosa induce pulmonary inflammation in vivo and
that IRF-1 is involved in some of the cytokine responses to LPS and ETA.

Numerous evidence has demonstrated the involvement in growth control of
interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which shows tumor suppressor
activity. IRF-1 is a well-studied member of the IRF transcription factors that
reveals functional diversity in the regulation of cellular response by activating
expression of a diverse set of target genes, depending on the cell type and on
the specific stimuli. IRF-1 gene rearrangements may be a crucial point in the
pathogenesis of some cancer types. Furthermore, different aspects of the tumor
suppressor function of IRF-1 may be explained, at least in part, by the
observations that IRF-1 is a regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis and that its
inactivation accelerates cell transformation. Studies on gene knockout mice
contributed greatly to the clarification of these multiple IRF-1 functions. We
summarize our current knowledge of the antigrowth effect of IRF-1, focusing also 
on a more general involvement of IRF-1 in mediating negative regulation of cell
growth induced by numerous cytokines and other biologic response modifiers.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF) constitute a family of transcriptional 
activators and repressors implicated in multiple biologic processes, including
regulation of immune responses and host defense, cytokine signalling, cell growth
regulation, and hematopoietic development. All members are characterized by
well-conserved DNA binding domains at the N-terminal region that recognize
similar DNA sequences termed IRF-binding element/IFN-stimulated response element 
(IRF-E/ISRE) present on the promoter of the IFN-alpha/beta genes and of some
IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). Recently, a sequence homologous to the ISRE has been 
identified downstream of the 5' human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long 
terminal repeat (LTR). This sequence is a binding site for IRF-1 and IRF-2.
Deletion of the LTR-ISRE results in impaired LTR promoter activity and decreased 
synthesis of viral RNA and proteins. Here, we briefly summarize characteristics
of IRF-1 and IRF-2 binding to the HIV-1 LTR-ISRE and the data obtained to date on
the functionality of this cis-element and on the role of IRF in the regulation of
HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity.

IRF and tuberculosis.

Pine R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY 10016, USA. rpine@phri.org

Tuberculosis is the most prevalent infectious disease and causes more deaths than
any other, yet only 5%-10% of people infected by the causative agent,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, will develop the disease. Thus, natural resistance
among humans is the norm. Fundamental immune responses to M. tuberculosis are
being elucidated, including induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). 
Moreover, IRF-1 has been found necessary for normal resistance to infection by
mycobacteria in mice. Roles for IRF-1 in a plethora of immune system functions
have been described. This review considers molecular responses to infection by M.
tuberculosis that might account for induction of IRF-1 and highlights putative
connections between immunomodulatory functions of IRF-1 and immune responses
relevant to infection by M. tuberculosis. However, the complexity inherent in
pleiotropy and redundancy limits the ability to draw firm conclusions. In many
cases, it remains to be demonstrated that a particular function of IRF-1 is the
basis for a known response to infection. For example, although IRF-1 is required 
for a Th1 cell-mediated, adaptive immune response in some circumstances, it is
not known if the Th1 response to infection by M. tuberculosis requires IRF-1.
Conversely, some known contributions by IRF-1 to fundamental aspects of the
immune system are not yet proven relevant in the host response to infection. For 
example, it is not known if control of T cell subset development by IRF-1 is
significant for host defense against M. tuberculosis. Functions of other IRF that
overlap with or are distinct from the functions of IRF-1 also could be important 
for the immune response to M. tuberculosis.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was isolated by virtue of its
affinity to specific DNA sequences in the IFN-beta promoter that mediate virus
responsiveness. IRF-1 was the first factor identified of the IRF family and was
most extensively characterized at the molecular level. Also, its physiologic role
in host defense against pathogens, tumor prevention, and development of the
immune system was investigated in detail. Even though some of the functions first
associated with IRF-1 were later found to be mediated in part or predominantly by
other activators of the IRF family of transcription factors, IRF-1 has remained a
central paradigm in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response.

[Article in Chinese]

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if infection of human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV8) exists 
in Chinese patients with multiple myeloma (MM), and to identify the relationship 
between clinical manifestation and the viral load in bone marrow biopsy samples.
METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was conducted to define the viral load of
HHV8 in bone marrow biopsy samples from 23 patients with MM. Nested PCR was
conducted to amplify the KS330(233)Bam fragment of HHV8 from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow biopsy samples. RT-PCR
was used to study the expression of suspected oncogenes: vIL-6 and vIRF-1 genes. 
Bone marrow biopsy samples of 5 patients with blood diseases other than MM and 5 
patients with non-blood system diseases were used as controls. PCR product of
BCBL-1 cell line was used as positive control.
RESULTS: (1) The positive rate of HHV8 in bone marrow biopsy samples from
patients with MM was 69.6% (16/23) by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR,
and 82.6% (19/23) by nested-PCR. 16 bone marrow samples positive by fluorescence 
quantitative were positive too by nested-PCR. However, 3 bone marrow samples
positive by nested-PCR were negative by fluorescence quantative. HHV8 was
positive in only one of the 25 bone marrow aspirates from patients with MM (4%)
and in none of the 20 peripharal blood samples from patients with MM. PCR showed 
negative result in 7 bone marrow aspirates taken form 13 MM patients with
positive result by fluorescence quantative PCR. HHV8 was negative in bone marrow 
biopsy samples from patients with other diseases. HHV8 was negative in the
peripheral blood samples from 16 MM patients, among which 9 out of the 11 cases
with bone marrow biopsy samples taken showed HHV8 positive by fluorescence
quatative PCR. Bone marrow biopsy samples of all patients with other blood
diseases and non-blood system diseases were HHV8 negative. RT-PCR showed that
among 12 MM patients the expression rate of vIRF-1 was 83.3% (10/12), and
expression rate of vIL-6 was 0. The PCR positive products tallied with the
sequence of HHV8 DNA. Clinical analysis showed that all of the patients with
negative results had had chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: There is a certain association between multiple myeloma pathogenesis 
and HHV8. In detection of HHVb, nested-PCR is more sensitive than fluorescence
quantitaative PCR. The viral gene vILR-1 plays a certain role in the pathogenesis
of MM.

activity.

The mechanisms that regulate the transcription of the tumour suppressor genes p53
and IRF-1 are poorly understood. We have characterized a 68-kDa transcription
factor, GAAP-1 (gatekeeper of apoptosis activating proteins), encoded by an
alternative splice product of the PRDII-BF1 gene, that recognizes a novel
regulatory element within the p53 and IRF-1 promoters. Transfection of U937 cells
with GAAP-1 activates p53 and IRF-1 expression and leads to apoptosis, whereas
over-expression of GAAP-1 in K562 cells that lack p53 and IRF-1 induces cell
differentiation. Alterations in the 6p24 locus containing the GAAP-1 gene are
frequent in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and AML-derived cell lines display 
reduced GAAP-1 mRNA levels. Together, these results suggest that GAAP-1 acts as a
gatekeeper at a critical point in the tumour suppressor gene pathway.

tau regulation of IRF-1.

Interferon tau (IFNtau) is the pregnancy recognition signal produced by the
conceptus trophectoderm and acts in a paracine manner on the ovine endometrium to
increase expression of IFN-stimulated genes primarily in the stroma and deep
glandular epithelium, including IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). The roles of
Stat1, Stat2, and IRF-9 in IFNtau regulation of IRF-1 expression were determined 
using human stromal fibroblasts lacking specific IFN signaling components or
complemented with specific Stat1 mutants. In parental (2fTGH) cells treated with 
IFNtau, Stat1alpha/beta was tyrosine phosphorylated by 15 min, and IRF-1 mRNA and
protein increased from 0 to 6 h, was maximal at 6 h, and decreased to 24 h. In
contrast, IFNtau did not affect IRF-1 expression in Stat1- and Stat2-deficient
cells or in Stat1-deficient cells complemented with Stat1 Y701Q or Stat1 R602L
mutants. In Stat1-deficient cells complemented with the Stat1 S727A mutant,
Stat1alpha, or Stat1beta and treated with IFNtau, IRF-1 increased from 0 to 6 h, 
was maximal at 6 h, and decreased thereafter. In IRF-9-deficient cells stimulated
with IFNtau, IRF-1 increased from 0 to 6 h but did not exhibit the sharp decline 
from 6 to 12 h observed in other cells. Collectively, results indicate that
IFNtau effect on IRF-1 expression is primarily regulated by
tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1alpha or Stat1beta dimers, whereas the decline of
IRF-1 after 6 h of IFNtau treatment is regulated by IRF-9.

Viral IFN-regulatory factors inhibit activation-induced cell death via two
positive regulatory IFN-regulatory factor 1-dependent domains in the CD95 ligand 
promoter.

The CD95 (also called APO-1/Fas) system plays a major role in the induction of
apoptosis in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. The CD95 ligand (CD95L) is induced
in response to a variety of signals, including IFN-gamma and TCR/CD3 stimulation.
Here we report the identification of two positive regulatory IFN-regulatory
factor-dependent domains (PRIDDs) in the CD95L promoter and its 5' untranslated
region, respectively. EMSAs demonstrate specific binding of IFN-gamma-induced
IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) to the PRIDD sequences. Ectopic IRF-1 expression 
induces CD95L promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRIDDs play an 
important role in TCR/CD3-mediated CD95L induction. Most interestingly, viral
IRFs of human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) totally abolish IRF-1-mediated and strongly
reduce TCR/CD3-mediated CD95L induction. We demonstrate here for the first time
that viral IRFs inhibit activation-induced cell death. Thus, these results
demonstrate an important mechanism of HHV8 to modulate the immune response by
down-regulation of CD95L expression. Inhibition of CD95-dependent T cell function
might contribute to the immune escape of HHV8.

HLA-G unique promoter region: functional implications.

In contrast to the highly polymorphic HLA class Ia genes that exhibit a broad
somatic tissue distribution, the restricted constitutive expression of HLA-G to
trophoblast and a subset of thymic epithelial cells suggests tight
transcriptional control of this MHC class Ib gene. Transactivation of MHC class I
genes is mediated by three major regulatory modules present in their promoter
region namely enhancer A, ISRE, and SXY. The 220-bp promoter sequence of HLA-G
comprises modified enhancer A and SXY modules and lacks the ISRE which renders
this gene unresponsive to NK-kappaB, IRF1, and class II transactivator
DNA-binding factors. A number of other HLA-G upstream regulatory elements have
recently been described. Using different transgenic HLA-G mouse models under the 
control of the HLA-G promoter, several groups have shown by in situ hybridization
and/or qualitative or quantitative RT-PCR that constitutive HLA-G transcriptional
expression in placental tissue decreased with gestational time. This suggests
that once the placenta is fully formed, the functions of HLA-G might not be so
crucial.

The induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO) expression and the tryptophan
(Trp)-kynurenine (Kyn) metabolic pathway during in vivo infection with Toxoplasma
gondii was investigated. Decreased levels of Trp and increased formation of Kyn
were observed in the lungs, brain, and serum from mice infected with T. gondii.
Maximal INDO mRNA expression and enzyme activity were detected in the lungs at 10
to 20 days postinfection. Further, the induction of INDO mRNA expression, Trp
degradation and Kyn formation were completely absent in tissues from mice
deficient in IFN-gamma (IFN-gamma(-/-)) or IFN regulatory factor -1 (IRF-1(-/-)).
These findings indicate the important role of endogenous IFN-gamma and IRF-1 in
the in vivo induction of the Trp-Kyn metabolic pathway during acute infection
with T. gondii. In contrast, expression of INDO mRNA and its activity was
preserved in the tissues of TNF-receptor p55- or inducible nitric oxide
synthase-deficient mice infected with T. gondii. Together with the results
showing the extreme susceptibility of the IFN-gamma(-/-) and the IRF-1(-/-) mice 
to infection with T. gondii, our results indicate a possible involvement of INDO 
and Trp degradation in host resistance to early infection with this parasite.

Interferon (IFN)-gamma induces the expression of the gp91(phox) gene both during 
myeloid differentiation and also in mature phagocytes through several
cis-elements and their binding proteins. To find new cis-elements for this
induction, transient expression assays were performed using a reporter gene
driven by serially truncated gp91(phox) promoters in U937 cells. The results
suggest that a critical cis-element for induction exists in the region from bp
-115 to -96 of the promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that a
gamma-activated sequence (GAS) element at bp -100 (-100GAS) of the gp91(phox)
promoter plays a pivotal role for the IFN-gamma-dependent activity of the bp -115
to +12 region of the gp91(phox) promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
using several GAS competitors and specific antibodies indicated that
phosphorylated STAT-1alpha specifically binds to the -100GAS. Site-directed
mutagenesis showed that an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) at bp
-88 (-88ISRE) mediates the induction of the gene by IFN-gamma in cooperation with
-100GAS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that IRF-1 dominantly binds 
to -88ISRE in an IFN-gamma-dependent fashion. These results demonstrate a new
mechanism for IFN-gamma-induced transcription of the gp91(phox) gene by the
cooperation of STAT-1alpha and IRF-1 binding to -100GAS and -88ISRE,
respectively.

Cytokine-inducible CD40 expression in human endothelial cells is mediated by
interferon regulatory factor-1.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cardiovascular Physiology, University of Goettingen, Germany.

Given the significance of CD40-CD40 ligand interactions in chronic inflammatory
diseases including atherosclerosis, the transcriptional regulation of CD40
expression as a potential therapeutic target was investigated in human umbilical 
vein cultured endothelial cells. Exposure to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plus
tumor necrosis factor-alpha resulted in a marked synergistic de novo expression
of CD40, which, according to electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, was
attributable to activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-kappaB), signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1), and
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Subsequent time-course studies revealed
that de novo synthesis of IRF-1 preceded that of CD40. Decoy oligodeoxynucleotide
(ODN) neutralization of STAT-1 or IRF-1, but not of NF-kappaB, inhibited
cytokine-stimulated CD40 expression by 60% at both the mRNA and protein levels,
and this effect was mimicked by antisense ODN blockade of IRF-1 synthesis. In
contrast, CD40 expression in response to IFN-gamma stimulation was sensitive to
neutralization of STAT-1 only. These findings suggest that depending on the
cytokine composition, CD40 expression in human endothelial cells under
proinflammatory conditions is governed by STAT-1 either directly or indirectly
through de novo synthesis of IRF-1. Moreover, decoy ODN neutralization of these
transcription factors may provide a novel therapeutic option for interfering with
CD40-CD40 ligand-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo.

Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is not
sufficient for the induction of STAT1-dependent genes in endothelial cells.
Comparison of interferon-gamma and oncostatin M.

We compared human endothelial cell (EC) responses to interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)
and oncostatin M (OnM), cytokines that utilize Janus kinase/signal transducer and
activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Both cytokines cause
phosphorylation of Tyr residue 701 and Ser residue 727 of STAT1, as shown by
immunoblotting. Both activate DNA binding of STAT1 homodimers, shown by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, only IFN gamma increases
expression of three STAT1-dependent gene products examined, namely transporter
associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP1), interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF1), and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein, as
demonstrated by immunoblotting. Only IFN gamma increases TAP1 transcription
assessed by reporter gene assay. OnM pretreatment or co-treatment does not
inhibit IFN gamma responses. Interestingly, IFN gamma activation of STAT1 is
considerably more long-lived than that produced by OnM. To determine whether
duration is functionally significant, we transduced EC with a chimeric receptor
containing extracellular domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta 
and intracellular regions of gp130, the signaling subunit of the OnM receptor,
mutated to prevent binding of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Addition of
platelet-derived growth factor to such transduced cells produces STAT1 activation
that is comparable in magnitude and duration to that caused by IFN gamma, but
still fails to induce TAP1, IRF1, or class I MHC molecules. OnM also activates
STAT1 but not transcription of STAT1-dependent genes in HepG2 cells. Transient
transfection of HepG2 cells with a STAT-defective mouse IFN gamma receptor failed
to complement the OnM STAT signal. We conclude that STAT1 activation is necessary
but not sufficient for induction of transcription of IFN gamma-responsive genes. 
However, signals provided by IFN gamma other than STAT1 activation cannot be
provided in trans to complement the response to OnM.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 is required for interferon-gamma-induced MHC class
I genes in astrocytes.

Recent studies have shown that the role of the transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in the expression of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I molecules is tissue-specific. Our previous studies indicated a role
for IRF-1 in expression of MHC class I genes in cultured astrocytes in response
to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). However, the requirement for IRF-1 in MHC class 
I expression has not been directly analyzed in neural tissue. To further
ascertain the importance of IRF-1 in the induction of MHC class I genes in
astrocytes in response to IFN-gamma, we analyzed astrocytes from mice with a
targeted disruption of the IRF-1 gene (IRF-1(-/-) mice). As expected, astrocytes 
from wild type (IRF-1(+/+)) mice showed a coordinate increase in both IRF-1 and
MHC class I gene expression in response to IFN-gamma. To the contrary, astrocytes
from IRF-1(-/-) mice had greatly reduced MHC class I mRNA expression. MHC class I
gene promoter activity in astrocytes was controlled entirely through a single
enhancer, the MHC-IRF-E, to which IRF-1 bound in response to IFN-gamma in wild
type but not in IRF-1(-/-) mouse astrocytes. In vivo, astrocytes in brains of
wild type mice readily responded to IFN-gamma to express MHC class I molecules.
This correlated with increased MHC class I mRNA in the brain. In contrast, brains
of IRF-1(-/-) mice showed no MHC class I gene induction following exposure to
IFN-gamma indicating that all cells in the central nervous system (CNS) including
astrocytes with the potential to express MHC class I molecules were dependent on 
IRF-1. These studies conclusively demonstrate a major role for IRF-1/MHC-IRF-E
interactions in controlling MHC class I gene expression in astrocytes in response
to IFN-gamma.

A soluble factor(s) secreted from CD8(+) T lymphocytes inhibits human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication through STAT1 activation.

CD8(+) T lymphocytes can suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
replication by secreting a soluble factor(s) known as CD8(+) T-lymphocyte
antiviral factor (CAF). One site of CAF action is inhibition of HIV-1 RNA
transcription, particularly at the step of long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene
expression. However, the mechanism by which CAF inhibits LTR activation is not
understood. Here, we show that conditioned media from several herpesvirus
saimari-transformed CD8(+) T lymphocytes inhibit, in a time- and dose-dependent
manner, the replication of HIV-1 pseudotype viruses that express the envelope
glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (HIV-1(VSV)). The same conditioned
media also inhibit phorbol myristate acetate-induced activation of the HIV-1 LTR 
and activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
protein. We have obtained direct evidence that STAT1 is necessary for
CAF-mediated inhibition of LTR activation and HIV-1 replication. Thus, the
inhibitory effect of CAF on HIV-1(VSV) replication was abolished in
STAT1-deficient cells. Moreover, CAF inhibition of LTR activation was diminished 
both in STAT1-deficient cells and in cells expressing a STAT1 dominant negative
mutant but was restored when STAT1 was reintroduced into the STAT1-deficient
cells. We also observed that CAF induced the expression of interferon regulatory 
factor 1 (IRF-1), and that IRF-1 gene induction was STAT-1 dependent. Taken
together, our results suggest that CAF activates STAT1, leading to IRF-1
induction and inhibition of gene expression regulated by the HIV-1 LTR. This
study therefore helps clarify one molecular mechanism of host defense against
HIV-1.

Clinical studies have suggested a causal or contributory role of Chlamydia
pneumoniae infection in asthma and atherosclerosis. The activation of synthetic
functions of smooth muscle cells (SMC) including the production of cytokines and 
growth factors plays a major role in the formation of fibrous atherosclerotic
plaques as well as in structural remodelling of the airway wall in chronic
asthma. In this study we demonstrated that C. pneumoniae induced the production
of low levels of interferon (IFN)-beta in bronchial and vascular SMC when
infected cells were treated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
IFN-beta production was analysed by reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. The upregulation of IFN-beta was paralleled by an increase
in mRNA levels of interferon regulatory factor-1 and interferon-stimulated gene
factor 3gamma, two transcription factors activating the expression of the
IFN-beta gene. In addition, C. pneumoniae infection enhanced the mRNA level of
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, an IFN-inducible factor mediating the restriction of
intracellular chlamydial growth, in TNF-alpha-stimulated SMC. C.
pneumoniae-induced IFN-beta production by SMC may modulate inflammation and
tissue remodelling during respiratory and vascular infection.

Characterization of IFN-gamma regulation of the complement factor B gene in
macrophages.

Huang Y(1), Krein PM, Winston BW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Division of Critical Care Medicine and Immunology
Research Group, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.

Complement factor B (Bf) is involved in the activation of the alternative
complement cascade. Bf is induced by IFN-gamma; however, the mechanisms of Bf
gene regulation have not been well characterized in general, and not in
macrophages specifically. Northern analysis reveals that IFN-gamma induces a
dose- and time-dependent increase in Bf mRNA expression in primary macrophages
and macrophage cell lines. MH-S cells transfected with reporter constructs
containing truncated regions of the Bf promoter reveal that IFN-gamma
responsiveness lies between -154 and -53 bp on the Bf promoter. This region of
the Bf promoter contains both an IFN-gamma-activation site (GAS) and an
interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). Site-directed mutagenesis of the
GAS binding site or the ISRE binding site in this region of the Bf promoter
partially inhibits IFN-gamma responsiveness. Mutagenesis of both the GAS and ISRE
cis elements totally abrogates IFN-gamma responsiveness of the Bf promoter.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal nuclear binding complexes involving 
both Bf-GAS and Bf-ISRE oligonucleotide sequences upon IFN-gamma stimulation. In 
competition assays, both Bf-GAS and Bf-ISRE oligonucleotides, but not mutant
Bf-GAS nor mutant Bf-ISRE oligonucleotides, compete for the DNA binding.
Supershift analysis reveals that Stat1-GAS and IRF-1-ISRE nuclear binding
complexes contribute to induction of Bf by IFN-gamma. Western analysis confirms
an IFN-gamma-stimulated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. These
findings suggest that both GAS and ISRE cis binding sites have an additive effect
on IFN-gamma-stimulated Bf gene expression and that both are required for full
expression of Bf by IFN-gamma. Stat1 and IRF-1 take part in IFN-gamma-stimulated 
Bf gene induction in macrophages through their respective cis binding elements.

Molecular mechanisms of iNOS induction by IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma in rat aortic
smooth muscle cells.

Author information:

College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912-2500, USA.

In rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC), interferon (IFN)-gamma enhanced
nitrite accumulation and type II nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression 
induced by interleukin (IL)-1 beta. IFN-gamma alone had no effect on nitrite
accumulation or iNOS protein. IL-1 beta, but not IFN-gamma, induced nuclear
factor (NF)-kappa B and CCAAT box/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) nuclear
binding. Conversely, IFN-gamma, but not IL-1 beta, induced signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1
binding. In a -1.4-kb rat iNOS promoter segment, deletion of an
IFN-gamma-activated site (GAS) increased IL-1 beta-induced activity but inhibited
IFN-gamma-enhanced activity, suggesting a two-way effect of the GAS site on iNOS 
induction: enhancing induction through STAT1 activation and inhibiting induction 
through a non-IFN-gamma-mediated mechanism. Deletion of both an IRF and a C/EBP
site reduced the IL-1 beta-induced and the IFN-gamma-enhanced activities.
However, IRF site mutations decreased the IFN-gamma-enhanced activity without
affecting the IL-1 beta-induced activity. Insertion of two IRF sites increased
the IFN-gamma-enhanced, but not the IL-1 beta-induced, activity. Mutations of a
reverse NF-kappa B site did not significantly change IFN-gamma-enhanced activity.
We conclude that in RASMC, NF-kappa B and C/EBP mediate the IL-1 beta-induced
iNOS expression, whereas IRF-1 and STAT1 mediate the IFN-gamma-enhanced iNOS
induction.

The heterodimeric interferon (IFN)-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) is formed of two
chains. Here we show that the binding chain (IFN-gammaR1) was highly expressed on
the membranes of T, B, and myeloid cells. Conversely, the transducing chain
(IFN-gammaR2) was highly expressed on the surfaces of myeloid cells, moderately
expressed on B cells, and poorly expressed on the surfaces of T cells.
Differential cell membrane expression of IFN-gammaR2 determined the number of
receptor complexes that transduced the IFN-gamma signal and resulted in a
different response to IFN-gamma. After IFN-gamma stimulation, high IFN-gammaR2
membrane expression induced rapid activation of signal transducer and activator
of transcription-1 (STAT-1) and high levels of interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1), which then triggered the apoptotic program. By contrast, low cell
membrane expression resulted in slow activation of STAT-1, lower levels of IRF-1,
and induction of proliferation. Because the forced expression of IFN-gammaR2 on T
cells switched their response to IFN-gamma from proliferative to apoptotic, we
concluded that the surface expression of IFN-gammaR2 determines whether a cell
stimulated by IFN-gamma undergoes proliferation or apoptosis.

1. In this study we examined the signalling events that regulate
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated induction of interferon regulatory factor
(IRF)-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). 2. LPS stimulated a
time- and concentration-dependent increase in IRF-1 protein expression, an effect
that was mimicked by the cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. 3. LPS
stimulated a rapid increase in nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) DNA-binding
activity. Pre-incubation with the NFkappaB pathway inhibitors,
N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate 
(PDTC), or infection with adenovirus encoding IkappaBalpha, blocked both IRF-1
induction and NFkappaB DNA-binding activity. 4. LPS and TNFalpha also stimulated 
a rapid activation of gamma interferon activation site/gamma interferon
activation factor (GAS/GAF) DNA-binding in HUVECs. Preincubation with the Janus
kinase (JAK)-2 inhibitor, AG490 blocked LPS-stimulated IRF-1 induction but did
not affect GAS/GAF DNA-binding. 5. Preincubation with TLCK, PDTC or infection
with IkappaBalpha adenovirus abolished LPS-stimulated GAS/GAF DNA-binding. 6.
Incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies to RelA/p50 supershifted GAS/GAF
DNA-binding demonstrating the involvement of NFkappaB isoforms in the formation
of the GAS/GAF complex. 7. These studies show that NFkappaB plays an important
role in the regulation of IRF-1 induction in HUVECs. This is in part due to the
interaction of NFkappaB isoforms with the GAS/GAF complex either directly or via 
an intermediate protein.

Interferons exert their biological function mainly through the activation of

a family of small, interferon alpha inducible genes of unknown function. We have

AMA by RACE. Comparing this sequence to ISG12 sequences in the expressed sequence
tag (EST) database revealed the presence of two alternative splice variants of
ISG12 in human cells exhibiting the same open reading frame. We have sequenced
the promoter region of the ISG12 gene and found ISRE, IRF1/IRF2, and STAT
elements correlating to the interferon alpha inducibility of the gene.
Subsequently, we have expressed human ISG12, a 12-kDa hydrophobic protein in the 
baculovirus expression system and with a C-terminal FLAG-tag in the human cell
line 293. Recombinant ISG12 sediments in the nuclear envelope in both cell types.
Finally, we have been able to demonstrate the prevalence of the ISG12 gene
product in the nuclear envelope of HeLa cells treated with interferon alpha by
immunocytochemical analyses. ISG12 is the first interferon induced protein found 
localizing to the nuclear envelope.

Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. yulee@bcm.tmc.edu

Prolactin (PRL), a pituitary peptide hormone, is known to regulate diverse
cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and
protection against apoptosis and inflammation. To understand the mechanism of PRL
signaling in T cells, we have cloned both PRL and its receptor (PRL-R), one
potent mediator of PRL signaling, Stat5b, and a panel of PRL-inducible immediate 
early genes from T cells. We are employing these genes as tools with which to
understand how PRL regulates the expression of one target gene, the transcription
factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which is a multifunctional immune 
regulator gene. In investigating regulatory events along the PRL-R/JAK/Stat/IRF-1
signaling pathway, we show that Stat factors can activate as well as inhibit
IRF-1 promoter activity and that cross-talk between Stat and NFkappaB signaling
pathways also regulates IRF-1 promoter activity. These findings have much broader
implications not only for T lymphocytes but also for other PRL responsive target 
cells and tissues.

Numerous transcription factors allow haematopoietic cells to respond to lineage- 
and stage-specific cytokines and to act as their effectors. It is increasingly
evident that the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) transcription factor can 
selectively regulate different sets of genes depending on the cell type and/or
the nature of cellular stimuli, evoking distinct responses in each. In the
present study, we investigated mechanisms underlying the differentiation-inducing
properties of granulocytic colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and whether IRF
transcription factors are functionally relevant in myeloid differentiation. Both 
normal human progenitors and murine 32Dcl3 myeloblasts induced to differentiate
along the granulocytic pathway showed an up-regulation of IRF-1 expression.
Ectopic expression of IRF-1 did not abrogate the growth factor requirement of
32Dcl3 cells, although a small percentage of cells that survived cytokine
deprivation differentiated fully to neutrophils. Moreover, in the presence of
G-CSF, granulocytic differentiation of IRF-1-expressing cells was accelerated, as
assessed by morphology and expression of specific differentiation markers.
Down-modulation of c-Myb protein and direct stimulation of lysozyme promoter
activity by IRF-1 were also observed. Conversely, constitutive expression of
IRF-2, a repressor of IRF-1 transcriptional activity, completely abrogated the
G-CSF-induced neutrophilic maturation. We conclude that IRF-1 exerts a pivotal
role in granulocytic differentiation and that its induction by G-CSF represents a
limiting step in the early events of differentiation.

IRF-1-mediated CAS expression enhances interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis of
HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells.

China.

The expression of CAS is reported to be upregulated in a variety of human tumor
cells, and such expression correlates with the development of tumors. CAS also
plays a role in apoptosis. We investigated whether CAS expression affects the
susceptibility of tumor cells to IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis. Our data show that 
IFN-gamma treatment induces CAS expression in HT-29 tumor cells.
IFN-gamma-induced gene expression is primarily mediated by the transcriptional
factor, IRF-1. Our data show that IRF-1 mediates IFN-gamma-induced CAS
expression. Transfection of HT-29 cells with CAS expression vector did not induce
apoptosis of cells; nevertheless, CAS overexpression greatly enhanced
IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis of cells. CPP32 is regarded as one of the central
apoptosis executioner molecules. CAS overexpression enhances IFN-gamma-induced
CPP32 expression. These results indicate that tumor cells highly expressing CAS
may be more susceptible to apoptosis induced by reagents that are capable of
inducing CAS expression. Thus, CAS may be a target for the elimination of tumors.

Deletional analysis of the murine IL-12 p35 promoter comparing IFN-gamma and
lipopolysaccharide stimulation.

IL-12, pivotal to the development of Th1 cells and formed by association of p35
and p40 subunits, is made by macrophages and the macrophage cell line RAW264.7.
In this study, the promoter for p35 was cloned and analyzed. The murine IL-12 p35
gene has promoters upstream from each of the first two exons. The exon 1 and exon
2 promoters, cloned into a reporter vector, were responsive to LPS or
IFN-gamma/CD40 ligation in transfected RAW264.7 cells. The exon 2 promoter
containing bp -809 to +1 has significant homology to the human p35 promoter.
Thus, deletion analysis was performed to determine the regions required for
responsiveness to LPS, CD40, and/or IFN-gamma. Base pairs -809 to -740 influenced
responsiveness to LPS. In contrast, bp -740to -444 and bp -122 to -100 were
required for responses to IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma/LPS, or IFN-gamma/CD40 ligation.
Removal of bp -444 to -392 increased the response of the exon 2 promoter to each 
stimulant. IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is involved in the activity of this
promoter at bp -108 to -103 because levels of nuclear IRF-1 correlated with exon 
2 promoter activity in response to IFN-gamma and IRF-1 overexpression stimulated 
and enhanced exon 2 promoter activity. Also, site or deletion mutation of the
IRF-1 element at bp -108 to -103 reduced the responsiveness of the promoter and
IRF-1 bound to an oligonucleotide containing bp -108 to -103. The data suggest
that the response of the p35 promoter to IFN-gamma requires a distinct IRF-1
positive regulatory element at bp -108 to -103.

Role of interferon regulatory factor-1 in double-stranded RNA-induced iNOS
expression by mouse islets.

Environmental factors, such as viral infection, have been implicated as potential
triggering events leading to the initial destruction of pancreatic beta cells
during the development of autoimmune diabetes. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the
active component of a viral infection that stimulates antiviral responses in
infected cells, has been shown in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
to stimulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide
production and to inhibit beta cell function. Interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1), the activation of which is induced by dsRNA, viral infection, and
IFN-gamma, regulates the expression of many antiviral proteins, including PKR,
type I IFN, and iNOS. In this study, we show that IRF-1 is not required for dsRNA
+ IFN-gamma-stimulated iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse
islets. In contrast to islets, dsRNA + IFN-gamma fails to induce iNOS expression 
or nitric oxide production by macrophages isolated from IRF-1(-/-) mice; however,
dsRNA + IFN-gamma induces similar levels of IL-1 release by macrophages isolated 
from both IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-1(+/+) mice. Importantly, we show that dsRNA- or
dsRNA + IFN-gamma-stimulated IRF-1 expression by mouse islets and peritoneal
macrophages is independent of PKR. These results indicate that IRF-1 is required 
for dsRNA + IFN-gamma-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by
mouse peritoneal macrophages but not by mouse islets. These findings suggest that
dsRNA + IFN-gamma stimulates iNOS expression by two distinct PKR-independent
mechanisms; one that is IRF-1-dependent in macrophages and another that is
IRF-1-independent in islets.

Sp1 is required for prolactin activation of the interferon regulatory factor-1
gene.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, One 
Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Transcription of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene (IRF-1) is induced in a 
biphasic manner (G1 and G1/S phase) in Nb2 T cells in response to prolactin (PRL)
stimulation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) is
required for PRL activation of the IRF-1 promoter. Mutation of a -200 bp Sp1 site
in the IRF-1 promoter results in a loss of G1 but not G1/S IRF-1 transcriptional 
activity in response to PRL. These studies illustrate that the temporal
transcription of the IRF-1 gene is mediated by not only Stat1 but also Sp1 in
response to PRL stimulation.

Double-stranded RNA-induced interferon regulatory factor-1 gene expression in
FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) plays a role in the regulation of cell growth and
apoptosis as well as in the cellular antiviral responses. However, it remains
unknown if dsRNA-activated signaling systems are functional in the thyroid. Here 
we report the presence of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) in FRTL-5 rat 
thyroid cells. In poly(I)-poly(C) (pIC)-stimulated cells, activation of nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF kappa B) binding was clearly induced. Incubation of FRTL-5
cells with pIC resulted in a marked increase in interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) mRNA and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1 (STAT1) levels. Addition of pIC to cells led to type I interferon
(IFN) gene expression, especially IFN beta, which can induce STAT1
phosphorylation, suggesting that dsRNA indirectly induced STAT1 phosphorylation
through expression of type I IFN. Thus, our results suggest that the
dsRNA-activated signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of
IFN-inducible genes in the thyroid.

Cytokine-like effects of prolactin in human mononuclear and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes.

Some biochemical events following the binding of prolactin (PRL) to its receptor 
in normal human leukocytes were investigated. PRL enhanced JAK2 phosphorylation
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but not in granulocytes. PRL also
induced phosphorylation of Stat-5 in PBMC and Stat-1 in granulocytes. Subsequent 
binding of Stat-5- and of Stat-1-like molecules to a GAS responsive element from 
the beta-casein promoter was detected by EMSA. p38 MAPK (but not p42/p44 MAPK)
was activated by PRL in both leukocyte populations. PRL induced iNOS and CIS mRNA
expression in granulocytes. Increased expression of IRF-1 and SOCS-2 was observed
in granulocytes and of SOCS-3 and iNOS in PBMC. Similar effects were obtained
with ovine and human PRL. Antiserum to PRL reduced iNOS and IRF-1 expression
induced by PRL in granulocytes and reduced iNOS expression in PBMC. Also,
pretreatment of granulocytes with a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) prevented in
part PRL-induced iNOS and IRF-1 expression. In PBMC, the p38 inhibitor decreased 
PRL-induced iNOS gene expression. These results indicate that PRL-induced gene
regulation in leukocytes requires the activation of at least two different
pathways: the Stat and the MAP kinase pathways. Moreover, although PRL activates 
Stat in both leukocyte types, signal transduction is different in granulocytes
and in PBMC. Most importantly, PRL modulates the expression of genes crucial to
leukocyte function. The present findings reinforce the concept that PRL has
"cytokine-like" activity in human leukocytes.

Increased binding of IFN regulating factor 1 mediates the synergistic induction
of CIITA by IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in human thyroid carcinoma 
cells.

Expression of MHC class II molecules is restricted to professional
antigen-presenting immune cells, but it can be induced by IFN-gamma in other cell
types. Thyroid cells have been shown to induce class II expression (mainly
HLA-DR) following stimulation with IFN-gamma and addition of tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-alpha synergistically enhanced this expression. Class II
transactivator (CIITA) has been implicated as the master regulator of MHC class
II molecules and its transcription has been shown to be regulated from four
different promoters, one of which is responsible for its induction by IFN-gamma. 
The aim of this study was to find whether CIITA is synergistically induced by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the human thyroid MRO-87-1 cell line, and to
investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this synergism. We have
demonstrated that IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha synergistically induce HLA-DRalpha and 
CIITA mRNAs, but prolonged incubation resulted in the inhibition of CIITA mRNA
accumulation. Several potential mechanisms that could explain the synergistic
effect were explored. NF-kappaB did not bind the CIITA inducible promoter and
addition of SN50, which inhibits NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus, did not 
change the synergistic effect. Furthermore, IFN-gamma did not induce IkappaBalpha
degradation. Synergistic activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT)-1 or IFN regulating factor (IRF)-1 was not observed, and
STAT-1 did not bind the CIITA inducible promoter. IRF-1, although not
synergistically induced or activated, bound synergistically to its specific cis
element on the CIITA type IV promoter. Thus we propose that IRF-1 binding
mediates the synergistic induction of HLA-DRalpha and CIITA in thyroid cells.

Monocytes/macrophages play a predominant role in the immunologic network by
secreting and reacting to a wide range of soluble factors. Human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection leads to deep immunologic dysfunctions, also as a
consequence of alterations in the pattern of cytokine release. Recent studies on 
in vivo models demonstrated that the expression of HIV Nef alone mimics many
pathogenetic effects of HIV infection. In particular, Nef expression in
monocytes/macrophages has been correlated with remarkable modifications in the
pattern of secreted soluble factors, suggesting that the interaction of Nef with 
monocytes/macrophages plays a role in the pathogenesis of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study sought to define possible
alterations in intracellular signaling induced by Nef in monocytes/macrophages.
Results demonstrate that HIV-1 Nef specifically activates both alpha and beta
isoforms of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). This 
was observed both by infecting human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with
HIV-1 deletion mutants, and by exploiting the ability of MDMs to internalize
soluble, recombinant Nef protein (rNef). STAT1-alpha activation occurs on
phosphorylation of both C-terminal Tyr701 and Ser727 and leads to a strong
binding activity. Nef-dependent STAT1 activation is followed by increased
expression of both STAT1 and interferon regulatory factor-1, a transcription
factor transcriptionally regulated by STAT1 activation. It was also established
that Nef-induced STAT1- alpha/beta activation occurs through the secretion of
soluble factors. Taken together, the results indicate that HIV-1 Nef could
interfere with STAT1-governed intracellular signaling in human
monocytes/macrophages.

Hepatitis C virus core protein modulates the interferon-induced transacting
factors of Jak/Stat signaling pathway but does not affect the activation of
downstream IRF-1 or 561 gene.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a propensity to cause chronic infection, with a low
proportion of patients exhibiting a sustained response to interferon-alpha
(IFNalpha) therapy. An earlier report suggested that HCV inhibits
IFNalpha-induced signal transduction through the Jak/Stat pathway by preventing
the formation of the transacting factor ISGF3 complex, although the effect on
downstream pathway and the specific viral protein responsible for inhibition of
IFNalpha-mediated signal transduction were not elucidated. HCV core protein
displays a number of intriguing functional properties and has been implicated in 
virus-mediated pathogenesis. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of core
protein upon IFNalpha- or IFNgamma-induced regulation of the Jak/Stat signaling
pathway. HCV core protein expression exhibited a reduced Stat1 expression in
IFN-treated mammalian cells. A gel retardation assay suggested a reduced level of
formation of the transacting factors, GAF and ISGF3, in IFN-treated cells.
Further studies from protein expression and RNase protection assay revealed that 
the reduced level of GAF or ISGF3 formation could be attributed to modulation of 
Stat1 protein expression, an important player for innate immunity in host defense
mechanism. However, these modulatory effects did not interfere with the
activation of the downstream effector genes, IRF-1 and 561, in IFN-treated cells.
Stable transfectants of cells after introduction of a plasmid DNA encoding both
the structural and the nonstructural proteins of HCV also exhibited a similar
effect. Taken together, these results suggest that although expression of the
core protein alone or with other HCV proteins modulate transacting factors of
Jak/Stat signaling pathway, expression of the downstream effector genes IRF-1 and
561 remains unaffected upon IFN treatment and may contribute to host defense
mechanism.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional factor, regulates type 
I interferon and interferon-induced genes. It was reported that IRF-1 regulates
important molecules required for inflammation and immune reactions. To
investigate the role of IRF-1 in the development of autoimmune diabetes, we
established IRF-1 deficient (IRF-1(-/-)) non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice.
IRF-1-deficient C57BL/6J mice were out-crossed to NOD mice, and F1 were
backcrossed to NOD mice. At the N8 generation, the heterozygote for IRF-1
mutation was intercrossed and N8F1 was obtained. Out of three NOD genotypes,
IRF-1(+/+) and IRF-1(+/-) developed spontaneous diabetes with an incidence of 47%
(9/19) and 50% (10/20) by 30 weeks of age, respectively; whereas IRF-1(-/-) did
not develop diabetes (0/18, P< 0.01 vs. (+/+) and (+/-)). Histologically,
IRF-1(+/+) and IRF-1(+/-) had various degrees of insulitis, but IRF-1(-/-) had no
insulitis. In comparison with IRF-1(+/+), the percentage of CD4(+) and Mac-1(+)
splenic cells significantly increased, whereas CD3(+), CD8(+) and B220(+) cells
decreased in IRF-1(-/-). Furthermore, spleen cell proliferation in response to
Con A or murine GAD65 peptide, a major autoantigen of the pancreatic beta-cell,
significantly increased, and the IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio in the culture supernatant
significantly decreased in IRF-1(-/-), suggesting Th2 deviation in cytokine
balance. These results indicate that IRF-1 plays a key role in developing
insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice.

Experimental allergic myositis in SJL/J mouse. Reappraisal of immune reaction
based on changes after single immunization.

SJL/J mice have been subjected to immunization with wide varieties of antigens to
produce models of autoimmune disorders including experimental myositis. They also
have a defect in dysferlin gene and spontaneously develop muscle fiber
degeneration, a condition akin to limb-girdle type muscular dystrophy and Miyoshi
myopathy. To know whether muscle inflammation of SJL mice after immunization with
muscle fractions really represents immune-mediated myositis or no more than an
epiphenomenon of muscle degeneration due to dysferlin defect, we studied
immunological parameters after immunization with rabbit myosin B fraction.
Initial infiltration of macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes on day 11 was followed
by increase in number of CD8+ cells. Such increase was not observed in the
nontreated and adjuvant controls. Some infiltrating cells were interferon gamma
(IFN-gamma) positive. Furthermore, increased expression of the signal transducers
and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) and interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF-1) mRNA was shown in the first 2 weeks. These results indicate Th1 system
activity in the muscle, rather than simple dysferlin deficiency, particularly 1-3
weeks after immunization. Thus it is concluded that an immune-mediated myositis
is taking place at this stage. This model can be helpful in understanding
pathomechanisms involved in the early stage of human myositides. It has also
important implications concerning immune reactions associated with
transplantation or gene therapy for muscular dystrophies.

The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II in 
the CNS has received considerable interest because of its importance in
neurodegenerative or inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).
However, at the moment nothing is known about the expression patterns of
transcription factors controlling MHC expression in MS lesions. Here, we
performed an extensive immunohistochemical analysis on MS affected postmortem
brain tissue to determine the cellular localization and distribution of different
MHC-controlling transcription factors. We show that phagocytic macrophages in
active demyelinating MS lesions displayed a moderate to strong immunostaining of 
the MHC-specific transcription factors RFX and CIITA, as well as the general
transcription factors NF-kappaB, IRF1, STAT1, USF, and CREB, which was congruent 
with a strongly enhanced expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP, and HLA class I.
In the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), clusters of activated microglial
cells forming preactive lesions displayed an overall stronger expression level of
these transcription factors, combined with a strong to intense level of MHC class
I and class II immunostaining. In general, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes either
did not express, or weakly expressed, these transcription factors, correlating
with a lack of MHC class II and weak MHC class I expression. Together, the
elevated expression level of transcription factors governing expression of MHC
class I and class II molecules in activated microglial cells and phagocytic
macrophages strongly suggests a general state of microglial cell activation in MS
lesions.

Strain-dependent difference in inducible nitric oxide synthesis (iNOS) expression
in rat pancreatic islets correlates with interferon regulating factor 1 (IRF-1)
and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression.

Nitric oxide (NO) may be a necessary but not sufficient mediator of
cytokine-mediated, selective beta-cell destruction. Previously, we have described
a difference in NO-dependent IL-1beta sensitivity in vivo and in vitro of
pancreatic islets from two rat strains, Brown Norway (BN) and Wistar Kyoto (WK), 
the latter being the more sensitive strain. Here we investigated whether
strain-dependent, differential islet iNOS expression was associated with
differences in islet expression of the IL-1 receptor type 1(IL-1RI) or interferon
regulating factor 1 (IRF-1), and/or caused differences in HSP70 expression, a
marker of cell defence against oxidative stress.METHODS: isolated islets from
both rat strains were exposed to increasing concentrations of IL-1beta (0-150
pg/ml) for 24 hours or for varying culture periods (4-48 hours) to 15 pg/ml of
IL-1beta.
MEASUREMENTS: accumulated insulin and nitrite release into incubation medium, and
islet mRNA and protein expression of iNOS, IL-1RI, IRF-1 and HSP70 by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Higher insulin and lower nitrite release into the incubation medium were
seen for BN compared to WK rats islets in both dose- and time-response
experiments. IRF-1 expression preceded iNOS expression and was more pronounced in
WK than in BN islets. No strain differences were observed for islet expression of
IL-1RI. A strain-dependent HSP70 expression in response to IL-1beta with the
highest levels in WK rat islets following iNOS expression was seen.
CONCLUSION: There was a strain-dependent difference in iNOS expression which was 
associated with IRF-1 and HSP70 expression.

The interferon response genes 1 and 2 have been shown to be involved in the
regulation of differentiation and proliferation of cells of the myeloid series,
with the former functioning as an anti-oncogene and the latter as an oncogene. In
the study described here, the levels of expression of these two genes and the
ratio of their expression were compared in AML and normal marrow. The ratio of
gene expression was significantly less in AML marrow cells as compared to normal 
marrow cells [med ratio = 1.33 vs. 2.97, P = 0.003]. While the expression ratio
was unaffected by the presence or absence of either ras or fms mutations, p53
mutations were associated with higher IRF1:IRF2 expression ratios that wt p53
genes [med = 1.701 vs. 1.135, P = 0.014]. Given the functional characteristics
and the competitive nature of these two genes, it is possible that leukemic
transformation is associated with a fall in IRF1:IRF2 ratios. Finally, the
administration of IL4 can result in the normalization of the IRF1:IRF2 ratio in
the marrow cells of some patients with AML.

The production of nitric oxide by the calcium-independent inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) in glial cells has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of
various diseases. It is well known that in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
and cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, glial cells are induced to synthesize large
amount of nitric oxide (NO) (Bolaños et al., 1996; Nicoletti et al., 1998). The
signaling transduction pathways for iNOS transcription in astroglial cells have
however not yet been established. Because IFN-gamma receptor chains are
associated with Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK1 and JAK2) (Darnell et al., 1994), we
analyzed the involvement of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway in iNOS
expression. Our study shows increased JAK2 and STAT1 alpha/beta tyrosine
phosphorylation in primary astroglial cell culture after treatment with IFN-gamma
and LPS. A temporal correlation was observed between JAK2 and STAT1 alpha/beta
tyrosine phosphorylation, the appearance of interferon-regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) mRNA and the iNOS expression. Inhibition experiments showed that JAK2 and
STAT1 alpha/beta tyrosine phosphorylation were necessary for IFN gamma-mediated
iNOS induction in astroglial cells. We conclude that JAK2 and STAT1 alpha/beta
tyrosine phosphorylation is an early event involved in the expression of iNOS in 
astroglial cells.

Differing effects of IFN beta vs IFN gamma in MS: gene expression in cultured
astrocytes.

Satoh J(1), Kuroda Y.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School,
Nabeshima, Japan. satoj1@post.saga-med.ac.jp

BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials indicate that interferon-beta (IFN beta) is
effective in reducing exacerbations in relapsing-remitting MS, whereas IFN gamma 
provokes acute relapses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of IFN beta and the detrimental effects of IFN gamma in MS
remain to be characterized. Previously, the authors showed that IFN beta
inhibited IFN gamma-induced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
expression on astrocytes.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the gene expression profile in cultured fetal human
astrocytes after exposure to IFN beta, IFN gamma, or IFN beta plus IFN gamma.
METHODS: Astrocytes were incubated for 24 hours in the culture medium with or
without inclusion of 50 ng/mL recombinant human IFN beta, IFN gamma, or both. The
gene expression profile was studied by analyzing a cDNA expression array
containing clones of various functional classes.
RESULTS: Among 1,185 clones examined, the expression of six distinct genes was
markedly induced after IFN treatment. Northern blot analysis verified a
significant up-regulation of mRNA for interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) and 
pleiotrophin predominantly in astrocytes treated with IFN beta, both IRF-1 and
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA mainly in astrocytes treated with IFN
gamma, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 alpha and MHC class
I HLA-C mRNA equally in astrocytes exposed to either type of IFN. In contrast,
the treatment of astrocytes with either IFN beta or IFN gamma did not alter the
levels of expression of mRNA for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 27-kd heat
shock protein, prion protein, or defender against apoptotic cell death-1. No
antagonistic action was observed between IFN beta and IFN gamma in the pattern of
gene induction in astrocytes.
CONCLUSION: A preferential induction of IRF-7 in IFN beta-treated astrocytes and 
a predominant expression of IRF-1 in IFN gamma-exposed astrocytes might
contribute to one of the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinically opposite 
effects of IFN beta and IFN gamma in MS.

Cyclooxygenase-2 downregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase in rat intestinal

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression
has been demonstrated in inflamed intestinal mucosa. Although regulation of COX-2
and iNOS expression has been studied extensively, the interplay between these two
enzymes remains unclear. Because they play crucial roles in inflammation and/or
carcinogenesis, we investigated whether COX-2 regulates iNOS expression and
evaluated the effects of COX-2 inhibitor and arachidonic acid (AA) on iNOS
induction. The COX-2 gene coding region was stably transfected into rat
intestinal epithelial cells (RIE sense cells). After interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, iNOS and COX-2 expression was
evaluated by Western blotting. PGE(2) was measured by the enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) method. Expression of IFN response factor-1, phosphorylated extracellular
signal-related kinase-1 and -2, and Ikappa-Balpha was evaluated. Activator
protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were examined by gel mobility
shift assay; a supershift assay was performed to identify the NF-kappaB complex
components. JTE-522 or AA was added before IFN-gamma and LPS administration, and 
effects on iNOS and PGE(2) induction were evaluated by Western blotting or EIA.
iNOS protein and mRNA expression was inhibited in RIE sense cells. Although
NF-kappaB activation was suppressed and Ikappa-Balpha protein was more stable,
respectively, in RIE sense cells, no difference was noted in other transcription 
factors. JTE-522 increased iNOS protein expression in RIE cells. We conclude that
COX-2 suppressed iNOS expression in RIE cells through suppression of NF-kappaB by
stabilizing Ikappa-Balpha.

Author information: 
(1)Arthritis Research Campaign's Epidemiology Unit, University of Manchester, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To test for linkage and association to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in
multiplex families for polymorphic markers in candidate gene loci. Loci including
the cytokine cluster on 5q31.1 and IL10, both previously investigated in RA, were
included along with several other genes including ICAM-1, cMYC, the cytokine
cluster on 17q11.2 and IL1RA.
METHODS: One hundred eighty-five multiplex RA families were genotyped for 11
microsatellite markers close to candidate genes. Markers showing evidence of
linkage and/or association to RA were tested in a further cohort of families (n =
99).
RESULTS: A single microsatellite marker in the GSTM4 gene showed some evidence of
linkage, LOD 1.6 (p = 0.006). However, there was no evidence of excess allele
sharing in the second cohort of families tested. There was also evidence of
association to RA, using the transmission disequilibrium test for a dinucleotide 
repeat in the IRF gene in the cytokine cluster on 5q31.1; this was not replicated
in a second cohort of families.
CONCLUSION: Our results do not provide evidence of a role for these genes in RA
susceptibility.

One of the distinctive features of multiple sclerosis (MS) attacks is homing to
the CNS of activated T cells able to orchestrate humoral and cell-based events,
resulting in immune-mediated injury to myelin and oligodendrocytes. Of the
complex interplay occurring between T cells and CNS constituents, we have
examined some aspects of T-cell interactions with astrocytes, the major
components of the glial cells. Specifically, we focused on the ability of T cells
to regulate the gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in astrocytes, based on
previous evidence showing the involvement of this cytokine in CNS disorders. We
found that T-cell adhesion and T-cell soluble factors induce IL-6 gene expression
in U251 astrocytes through distinct signaling pathways, respectively, resulting
in the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF-1 transcription factors. In a search for
effector molecules at the astrocyte surface, we found that alpha3beta1 integrins 
play a role in NF-kappaB activation induced by T-cell contact, whereas
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptors dominate in IRF-1 induction brought about 
by T-cell-derived soluble factors. Similar phenomena were observed also in normal
fetal astrocyte cultures. We therefore propose that through astrocyte induction, 
T cells may indirectly regulate the availability of a cytokine which is crucial
in modulating fate and behavior of cell populations involved in the pathogenesis 
of MS inflammatory lesions.

Amphotericin B potentiates the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and 
causes nitric oxide-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in cytokine-treated
rodent astrocytes.

Belgrade, Belgrade, Yugoslavia. vladtr@eunet.yu

Because the neurotoxic effects of the antifungal drug amphotericin B (AMB)
closely resemble those ascribed to the highly reactive gaseous free radical
nitric oxide (NO), we investigated the effect of AMB on NO production in rodent
astrocytes. AMB caused a dose-dependent increase of NO generation in
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-stimulated rat and mouse astrocytes, as well as in
IFN-gamma + tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated rat astrocytoma
cell line C6. Treatment of rat astrocytes with AMB markedly potentiated
IFN-gamma-triggered expression of mRNA for iNOS, but not for its transcription
factor IRF-1. The activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB was apparently
required for AMB-induced iNOS mRNA expression, as the latter was abolished by
NF-kappaB inhibitors: pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and MG132. AMB-mediated
enhancement of astrocyte NO production was partly dependent on endogenous IL-1,
as shown by partial inhibition of AMB effect with IL-1 receptor antagonist.
IFN-gamma + AMB treatment led to reduction of astrocyte mitochondrial respiration
(measured by MTT assay) that has been completely reverted by selective iNOS
inhibitor aminoguanidine. AMB toxicity toward IFN-gamma-stimulated astrocytes was
dependent on both AMB and NO action, since AMB and NO-releasing substance SNP
synergized in inducing astrocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest
that the enhancement of cytokine-induced iNOS activation in astrocytes and the
subsequent release of high amounts of NO might be at least partly responsible for
AMB neurotoxicity.

SHP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibits gp91PHOX and p67PHOX expression by
inhibiting interaction of PU.1, IRF1, interferon consensus sequence-binding
protein, and CREB-binding protein with homologous Cis elements in the CYBB and
NCF2 genes.

H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago Lakeside Veterans Administration
Hospital, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.

The CYBB and NCF2 genes encode the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase proteins, 
gp91PHOX and p67PHOX. Previously, we identified homologous CYBB and NCF2 cis
elements that are necessary for lineage-specific transcription during late
myeloid differentiation. We determined that these homologous cis elements are
activated by PU.1, IRF1, interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP),
and the CREB-binding protein (CBP). Since expression of PU.1 and ICSBP is
lineage-restricted, our investigations identified a mechanism of lineage-specific
CYBB and NCF2 transcription. Since PU.1, IRF1, ICSBP, and CBP are expressed in
undifferentiated myeloid cells, our investigations did not determine the
mechanism of differentiation stage-specific CYBB and NCF2 transcription. In the
current investigations, we determine that SHP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase
(SHP1-PTP) inhibits gp91PHOX and p67PHOX expression, in undifferentiated myeloid 
cell lines, by decreasing interaction of PU.1, IRF1, ICSBP, and CBP with the CYBB
and NCF2 genes. We also determine that IRF1 and ICSBP are tyrosine-phosphorylated
during interferon gamma differentiation of myeloid cell lines, and we identify
IRF1 and ICSBP tyrosine residues that are necessary for CYBB and NCF2
transcription. Therefore, these investigations identify a novel mechanism by
which SHP1-PTP antagonizes myeloid differentiation and determine that tyrosine
phosphorylation of IRF1 and ICSPB mediates stage-specific transcriptional
activation in differentiating myeloid cells.

Failure of MHC class II expression in neonatal alveolar macrophages: potential
role of class II transactivator.

Lee PT(1), Holt PG, McWilliam AS.

Author information: 
(1)TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, The University of Western
Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

Neonatal peritoneal and blood macrophages are known to be ineffective in
antigen-presentation functions, and this manifests as inefficient MHC class II
expression in response to IFN-gamma. The underlying mechanisms responsible for
this maturational deficiency have not been elucidated. We show here that MHC
class II expression in alveolar macrophages (AM) from neonates is also refractory
to IFN-gamma stimulation. Furthermore, by examining the intracellular pathway
leading to MHC class II expression, we demonstrate that the site of the
impairment is at the level of transcription. Thus, expression of mRNA encoding
the class II transactivator (CIITA), MHC class II (RT1.B) and invariant chain
(Ii) was low or undetectable in neonatal AM stimulated with concentrations of
IFN-gamma that induced adult AM to up-regulate MHC class II expression. The
failure of AM from young animals to express MHC class II was not due simply to
deficient IFN-gamma receptor function since IFN-gamma-responsive genes such as
IRF-1, IRF-2 and IP-10 were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner from animals 
of all ages investigated. Importantly, the responsiveness of neonatal AM to
IFN-gamma, as determined by MHC class II expression, could be modulated to adult 
levels when pre-cultured in vitro. This suggests that microenvironmental factors 
operative in vivo may play a role in suppressing the expression of MHC class II
in AM from young animals. We have investigated the role of type I interferons but
did not find them to be responsible for the inability of AM from young animals to
induce MHC class II in response to IFN-gamma.

The obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is able to
establish persistent infections within human and animal hosts. We have shown
recently that T. gondii down-regulates IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression 
in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM4). As shown in this study, the
capacity of IFN-gamma-activated murine BMMphi to present ovalbumin to CD4+ T cell
hybridomas was dose-dependently inhibited by T. gondii. IFN-gamma-induced
up-regulation of H2-Aa, H2-Ab, H2-Eb, H2-Ma, H2-Mb, H2-Oa and invariant chain
transcripts was prominently down-regulated by T. gondii. Furthermore, mRNA levels
of class II transactivator and interferon-regulatory factor-1 were significantly 
diminished. Electromobility shift assays demonstrated a decrease in the binding
activity of nuclear extracts to the IFN-gamma-activated site after infection with
T. gondii, indicating parasitic interference with IFN-gamma-induced signaling.
However, neither the expression of the IFN-gammaR nor the IFN-gamma-induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-gammaR alpha chain and signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) 1alpha was diminished by T. gondii.
IFN-gamma-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha was nevertheless inhibited 
after infection as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular 
fractionation analyses. In conclusion, this novel mechanism of microbial
interference with MHC class II gene expression may contribute to intracellular
survival and establishment of persistent infection with T. gondii.

Multiple promoters exist in the human GR gene, one of which is activated by
glucocorticoids.

A new human GR gene sequence (hGR 1Ap/e), which is distinct from the previously
identified human GR promoter and coding sequences, has been isolated and
characterized. The hGR 1Ap/e sequence is approximately 31 kbp upstream of the
human GR coding sequence. This sequence (2,056 bp) contains a novel promoter (the
hGR 1A promoter; 1,075 bp) and untranslated exon sequence (hGR exon 1A sequence; 
981 bp). Alternative splicing produces three different hGR 1A-containing
transcripts, 1A1, 1A2, and 1A3. GR transcripts containing exon 1A1, 1A2, 1B, and 
1C are expressed at various levels in many cancer cell lines, while the exon
1A3-containing GR transcript is expressed most abundantly in blood cell cancer
cell lines. Glucocorticoid hormone treatment causes an up-regulation of exon
1A3-containing GR transcripts in CEM-C7 T-lymphoblast cells and a down-regulation
of exon 1A3-containing transcripts in IM-9 B-lymphoma cells. Deoxyribonuclease I 
footprinting using CEM-C7 cell nuclear extract reveals four footprints in the
promoter region and two intraexonic footprints. Much of the basal
promoter-activating function is found in the +41/+269 sequence, which contains
two deoxyribonuclease I footprints (FP5 and FP6). When this sequence is cloned
into the pXP-1 luciferase reporter gene, hormone treatment causes a significant
increase in luciferase activity in Jurkat T cells that are cotransfected with a
GR expression vector. FP5 is an interferon regulatory factor-binding element, and
it contributes significantly to basal transcription rate, but it is not activated
by steroid. FP6 resembles a glucocorticoid response element and can bind GRbeta. 
This novel hGR 1Ap/e sequence may have future applications for the diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of T-cell leukemia and lymphoma.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 promoter polymorphism and response to type 1
interferon.

The clinical success of interferon-treatment has been found to vary in different 
individuals. To explain this, we hypothesized that responses to type 1
interferons could be partly determined by interferon regulatory factor-1 gene
transcription, because the latter is an important transcription factor in the
interferon system. We demonstrated that the antiproliferative effect of type 1
interferons on human liver cancer cells correlates with levels of transcription
of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene in parallel with those of p21(WAF-1)
expression. Here, we investigated whether mutations in the interferon regulatory 
factor-1 gene cause different responses to type 1 interferons. DNA from several
human liver cancer cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
investigated. Nucleotide sequences of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene and
polymerase chain reaction products of its upstream region were determined
directly and after cloning. The promoter activity of the upstream region of this 
gene was measured by the luciferase reporter assay. We found 4 point mutations in
the upstream (- 1 approximately - 495) region, and the luciferase promoter assay 
demonstrated that these mutations did modify promoter activity. Analysis of DNA
from healthy volunteers showed that these mutations are single nucleotide
polymorphisms. These results suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms of the 
interferon regulatory factor-1 promoter contribute, at least in part, to
determining responses to type 1 interferons. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 36:

Con A administration results in dose-dependent immune-mediated liver injury.
Cytokines are important to determine the outcome of liver failure in this model, 
and especially TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma directly contribute to hepatocyte damage. 
The intracellular pathways of these two cytokines, which eventually result in
tissue destruction, are not well defined. Here we used anti-IFN-gamma Abs and
adenoviral vectors that express molecules inhibiting distinct TNF-alpha-dependent
pathways in hepatocytes to better understand the relevance of specific
intracellular signaling cascades for Con A-induced liver failure. We show that
activation of TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-dependent intracellular pathways occurs
prior to the influx of immune-activated cells into the liver and that
anti-TNF-alpha and anti-IFN-gamma neutralizing Abs cannot block infiltration of
these cells. Blocking experiments with Abs and adenoviral vectors showed that
NF-kappaB activation and the Fas-associated death domain protein/caspase 8
cascade in hepatocytes during Con A-induced liver failure have no impact on
tissue injury. Additionally, STAT1 activation alone after Con A injection in
liver cells does not result in liver damage. In contrast, IFN-gamma-dependent
expression of IFN regulatory factor-1 and TNF-alpha-dependent activation of c-Jun
N-terminal kinase in liver cells correlates with liver cell damage after Con A
injection. Therefore, our experiments indicate that 11418690

The Smad3 protein is involved in TGF-beta inhibition of class II transactivator
and class II MHC expression.

Dong Y(1), Tang L, Letterio JJ, Benveniste EN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.

TGF-beta is a immunoregulatory cytokine that inhibits class II MHC expression in 
a variety of cell types. Previous studies have shown that the class II MHC
transactivator (CIITA), a master regulator that controls class II MHC expression,
is targeted by TGF-beta for repression of IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC
expression in astrocytes. The mechanism(s) underlying the TGF-beta inhibitory
effect is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that TGF-beta inhibition 
of CIITA expression occurs at the transcriptional level, and that both
constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced human CIITA type IV promoter activity is
inhibited by TGF-beta. TGF-beta does not affect the signaling events that mediate
IFN-gamma activation of CIITA expression; i.e, TGF-beta does not inhibit
IFN-gamma-induced STAT-1alpha phosphorylation and/or DNA binding ability, nor is 
IFN-gamma induction of IFN regulatory factor affected. The inhibitory effect of
TGF-beta on the type IV CIITA promoter is mediated through a promoter region
within 80 bp from the transcription start site. Elimination of TGF-beta
inhibition of class II MHC and CIITA expression in Smad3-deficient astrocytes, as
well as restoration of the inhibitory effect by overexpression of the Smad3
protein, demonstrates that Smad3 is essential in mediating TGF-beta inhibition of
CIITA and class II MHC expression.

Medicine, Ehime, Japan.

We analyzed the mechanism that causes suppression of IL-12 p40 gene induction
during Plasmodium berghei infection. Although IL-12 together with IFN-gamma plays
an important role in protection against pathogenic infection, the IL-12 p70
protein production of infected macrophages is lower than that by the uninfected
macrophages. We showed in the present study that the induction of IL-12 p40 gene 
but not IL-12 p35 gene in macrophages of P. berghei-infected mice was profoundly 
inhibited. The inhibition was induced by interaction with macrophages that had
contacted with P. berghei-infected erythrocytes and was mediated by a soluble
factor, IL-10. There was comparable activation of NF-kappaB in uninfected and
infected cells. The induction of IFN-regulatory factor-1 gene was comparable in
transcription level in uninfected and infected cells, while the unidentified
complex formation of IFN-regulatory factor-1 was observed in infected cells.
Therefore, the inhibition of the IL-12 p40 gene induction appeared to be
regulated at transcriptional regulation level of the gene.

Double-stranded rna dependence of nitric oxide synthase 2 expression in human
bronchial epithelial cell lines BET-1A and BEAS-2B.

Uetani K(1), Arroliga ME, Erzurum SC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care Medicine and Allergy, Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

The human airway epithelium expresses abundant nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in 
vivo. Although NOS2 is easily induced by cytokines in primary cultured human
airway epithelial cells and lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, the human
bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and BET-1A do not express NOS2 in
response to cytokines. Mechanisms regulating NOS2 expression in human respiratory
epithelial cells are complex, but we have recently shown that NOS2 expression in 
primary human airway epithelial cells occurs in response to double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) through activation of signaling proteins including nuclear factor
(NF)-kappaB and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)-1. In this context, we
hypothesized that BEAS-2B and BET-1A cells may express NOS2 in response to dsRNA.
Here, we show that although cytokines (IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and
interleukin-1beta) do not induce NOS2 expression in BEAS-2B or BET-1A cells,
addition of dsRNA to this cytokine mix enables BEAS-2B cells to express NOS2.
IFN-gamma and dsRNA induction of NOS2 in BET-1A cells occurs in a serum
concentration-dependent manner, with a minimum of 3 d of serum treatment
necessary for BET-1A cells to acquire the potential to induce NOS2. Importantly, 
dsRNA strongly activates NF-kappaB and IRF-1 in BEAS-2B cells, transcription
factors essential for NOS2 gene expression in other cell lines. On the basis of
these results, dsRNA-activated signaling pathways are clearly important for NOS2 
expression in human respiratory epithelial cells. With conditions for NOS2
expression characterized, these cell lines are a convenient in vitro system to
investigate the mechanisms regulating NOS2 expression in human respiratory
epithelial cells.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of KE-298 and KE-758 on lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) induced nitric oxide (NO) production by the RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell
line, and the effect of KE-758 on spontaneous NO production by peritoneal cells
from rats with adjuvant induced arthritis.
METHODS: The amount of NO was determined using Griess reagents. The proteins for 
inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were detected by
Western blot, then mRNA for interferon-beta (IFN)-beta, IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1), and iNOS were detected by RT-PCR. Degradation of iNOS mRNA was analyzed 
using Northern blot. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in nuclear extracts was 
determined by EMSA. Adjuvant arthritis in rats was induced by inoculating heat
killed Mycobacterium butyricum s.c. in the tail.
RESULTS: KE-298 and KE-758 suppressed NO production by LPS activated RAW264.7
cells by inhibiting iNOS gene expression. Neither LPS induced NF-kappa B
activation nor degradation of iNOS mRNA was affected by KE-758 treatment. LPS
induced IFN-beta and IRF-1 gene expression were markedly suppressed by KE-758. In
rats with adjuvant induced arthritis, enhanced NO and iNOS production by cultured
peritoneal cells and the development of arthritis were suppressed by KE-758.
CONCLUSION: KE-758 suppressed LPS induced iNOS gene expression by murine
macrophage cells by inhibiting IFN-beta/IRF-1 expression. The potential of KE-758
to inhibit iNOS production might partly explain its efficacy on adjuvant induced 
arthritis in rats.

Illinois, USA.

Interferon regulatory factors IRF-1 and IRF-2, the two mutually antagonistic
factors, fluctuate during the cell cycle and play an important role in normal and
neoplastic growth processes. The relative levels of these two transcripts were
analyzed in 5 normal and 43 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bone marrow (BM)
specimens by a semiquantitative RT-PCR method. IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNA sequences
were coamplified using primers that were designed to span regions of high
homology between the genes. Each primer can anneal equally to both IRF-1 and
IRF-2 sequences. Hence, the relative amount of amplified products from each cDNA 
species provides an estimation of proportional concentration of the RNA
transcripts in the test sample. Results indicate expression of both the
transcripts on all the leukemia and lymphoma cell lines tested, normal and AML
BM. Significantly higher IRF-1:IRF-2 ratio was observed in normal as compared to 
AML BM (p = 0.007). There was no correlation with clinical factors such as FAB
subtype. A single dose of amifostine or three daily doses of recombinant IL-4
were administered to 5 and 8 AML patients, respectively. The changes in the
expression of these transcripts were studied prior to administration of the agent
(d0) and after 3 days (d3). IL-4 treatment showed significant increase in the
IRF-1:IRF-2 ratio in 4 of 8 patients (p = 0.05); amifostine treatment did not
show any appreciable change.

PURPOSE: Genetic alterations, including microsatellite instability (MSI), are
ultimate steps toward malignant process. To investigate MSI in A-bomb survivors, 
leukaemic cells were analysed from 13 acute myelocytic leukaemia patients with a 
history of radiation exposure and also in 12 de novo patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess the microsatellite changes, a fluorescent system
in 10 loci (BAT40, D3S643, D5S107, IRF1, MYC, D9S171, WT1, TP53, DM, D17S855) was
used.
RESULTS: MSI analysis revealed a high frequency of multiple microsatellite
changes in the exposed patients (84.6%) compared with non-exposed patients
(8.3%). There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These analyses clearly demonstrate that leukaemic cells from heavily
exposed patients contain a number of genetic instabilities that may strongly
influence the development of leukaemia among people exposed to the Hiroshima
A-bomb radiation.

Dual role of inflammatory stimuli in activation-induced cell death of mouse
microglial cells. Initiation of two separate apoptotic pathways via induction of 
interferon regulatory factor-1 and caspase-11.

We have previously shown that mouse microglial cells undergo apoptosis upon
inflammatory activation and that nitric oxide (NO) is the major autocrine
mediator in this process (Lee, P., Lee, J., Kim, S., Yagita, H., Lee, M. S., Kim,
S. Y., Kim, H., and Suk, K. (2001) Brain Res. 892, 380-385). Here, we present
evidence that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and caspase-11 are the
essential molecules in activation-induced cell death of microglial cells. The
apoptogenic action of inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) was mediated through the induction of IRF-1 and
caspase-11 expression in two separate events. Although IRF-1 was required for NO 
synthesis, caspase-11 induction was necessary for NO-independent apoptotic
pathway. Microglial cells from IRF-1-deficient mice showed markedly decreased NO 
production, and they were partially resistant to apoptosis in response to
LPS/IFNgamma but were sensitive to NO donor exposure. LPS/IFNgamma treatment
resulted in the induction of caspase-11 followed by activation of caspase-11, -1,
and -3. Inactivation of caspase-11 by the transfection of dominant-negative
mutant or treatment with the caspase inhibitors rendered microglial cells
partially resistant to LPS/IFNgamma-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of both NO
synthesis and caspase-11 completely blocked LPS/IFNgamma-induced cytotoxicity.
These results indicated that LPS/IFNgamma not only induced the production of
cytotoxic NO through IRF-1 but also initiated the NO-independent apoptotic
pathway through the induction of caspase-11 expression.

synergistically induce nitric oxide synthase 2 in macrophages through cooperative
action of nuclear factor-kappa B and IFN regulatory factor-1.

The radical nitric oxide (NO) constitutes an important part of the innate immune 
response to many viruses, and among these notably Herpes simplex virus (HSV). We 
have previously shown that HSV/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and
IFN-gamma synergistically induce NO production in macrophages, and here we have
investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon. The enhancement 
of NO production was regulated at the level of NO synthase 2 (NOS2, iNOS)
transcription. The ISRE element of the NOS2 promoter, which binds IFN regulatory 
factor (IRF)-1, was essential both for full responsiveness to IFN-gamma and the
synergistic response. The GAS motif, binding signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1), did not contribute to the cross-talk with
virus/TNF-induced signals, but was necessary for full responsiveness to
IFN-gamma. The distal binding site for nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B was important 
for the cooperative response, while the proximal kappa B site was not involved in
the cooperative promoter activation but played a role in full promoter
inducibility. By ectopic expression of IRF-1 and NF-kappa B (p65), we found that 
these factors synergistically induce NO accumulation. Together, our results show 
that binding of IRF-1 and NF-kappa B to their respective sites in the distal
domain of the NOS2 promoter, creates a potent trans-activating complex with the
ability to induce NOS2 transcription synergistically in response to simultaneous 
HSV-2/TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma treatment.

Viral interferon regulatory factor 1 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
binds to p53 and represses p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis.

Seo T(1), Park J, Lee D, Hwang SG, Choe J.

(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology, Daejeon 305-701, Korea.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is related to the development of
Kaposi's sarcoma. Open reading frame K9 of KSHV encodes viral interferon
regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1), which functions as a repressor of interferon- and
IRF1-mediated signal transduction. In addition, vIRF1 acts as an oncogene to
induce cellular transformation. Here we show that vIRF1 directly associates with 
the tumor suppressor p53 and represses its functions. The vIRF1 interaction
domains of p53 are the DNA binding domain (amino acids [aa] 100 to 300) and the
tetramerization domain (aa 300 to 393). p53 interacts with the central region (aa
152 to 360) of vIRF1. vIRF1 suppresses p53-dependent transcription and
deregulates its apoptotic activity. These results suggest that vIRF1 may regulate
cellular function by inhibiting p53.

Dual role of interferon-gamma signalling pathway in sensitivity of pancreatic
beta cells to immune destruction.

Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Disruption of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signalling
pathway at the level of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) protects islets
against cytokine-induced nitric oxide production and cell death in vitro. The aim
of this study was to investigate the effects of a global disruption of IFN-gamma 
signalling, or a selective disruption of IRF-1, on beta-cell sensitivity to in
vivo immune destruction.
METHODS: In a first set of experiments, IFN-gamma receptor knockout mice
(IFN-gammaR-/-) and interferon regulatory factor-1 knockout mice (IRF-1-/-) were 
rendered diabetic by injections of 50 mg streptozotocin i. p. on 5 consecutive
days (MLDSTZ).
RESULTS: Whereas no difference in sensitivity to MLDSTZ-induced diabetes could be
observed between IFN-gammaR-/- mice and their 129/Sv/Ev controls (50% vs 55%,
NS), there was an increased incidence of diabetes in IRF-1-/- mice (100% vs 67%
in C57B1/6 mice, p < 0.05). A similar increased sensitivity to immune destruction
of IRF-1-/- islets was observed when these islets were used as allografts. Islet 
graft survival rate of IFN-gammaR-/- and 129/Sv/Ev islets, when transplanted in
alloxan-diabetic BALB/c recipients, was comparable (12.0 +/- 1.9 days vs 12.9 +/-
2.3 days, NS). Allograft rejection, however, of IRF-1-/- islets by BALB/c
recipients occurred more rapidly than following transplantation to their C57B1/6 
controls (9.1 +/- 2.0 days vs 13.1 +/- 1.5 days, p < 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that IFN-gamma signal
transduction at the beta-cell level is not essential for immune beta-cell
destruction in vivo. Moreover, disruption of the IRF-1 gene in pancreatic islets 
increases susceptibility to beta-cell killing, suggesting that IRF-1 might be
necessary for the expression of putative beta-cell "defence and/or repair" genes.

PU.1 and multiple IFN regulatory factor proteins synergize to mediate
transcriptional activation of the human IL-1 beta gene.

Marecki S(1), Riendeau CJ, Liang MD, Fenton MJ.

Author information: 
(1)Pulmonary Center and Department of Pathology, Boston University School of
Medicine, Boston MA 02118, USA.

Both lymphoid and myeloid cells express two related members of the IFN regulatory
factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, specifically IRF-4 and IFN
consensus binding protein (ICSBP or IRF-8). We previously reported that
macrophages express IRF-4 and in combination with the ETS-like protein PU.1 can
synergistically activate a human IL-1beta reporter gene. Here we report that this
synergy is mediated by a composite PU.1/IRF element located within an upstream
enhancer known to confer cytokine- and LPS-inducible expression. In macrophages, 
synergistic activation of IL-1beta reporter gene expression was preferentially
mediated by IRF-4, whereas IRF-4 and ICSBP were equally capable of synergizing
with PU.1 when coexpressed in fibroblasts. Furthermore, coexpression of IRF-1 and
IRF-2 dramatically increased the capacity of both PU.1/IRF-4 and PU.1/ICSBP to
induce IL-1beta reporter gene expression in fibroblasts. The additional synergy
observed with IRF-1 and IRF-2 coexpression is mediated by a region of DNA
distinct from either the IL-1beta enhancer or promoter. We also assessed the
capacity of these transcription factors to activate endogenous IL-1beta gene when
overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Although ectopic expression of
PU.1 alone was sufficient to activate modest levels of IL-1beta transcripts,
endogenous IL-1beta expression was markedly increased following coexpression of
additional IRF proteins. Thus, maximal expression of both a human IL-1beta
reporter gene and the endogenous IL-1beta gene was observed in cells that
coexpressed PU.1, IRF-4 (or ICSBP), IRF1, and IRF2. Together, our observations
suggest that these factors may function together as an enhanceosome.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 differentially restores development of thymus-derived
CD4-8+ T cells and intestinal intraepithelial T cells in IFN-regulatory
factor-1-deficient mice.

Mice lacking IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)-1 have reduced numbers of mature CD8+ T 
cells within the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs, suggesting a critical
role of IRF-1 in CD8(+) T cell differentiation. Here we show that endogenous
Bcl-2 expression is substantially reduced in IRF-1(-/-)CD8+ thymocytes and that
introduction of a human Bcl-2 transgene driven by Emu or lck promoter in
IRF-1(-/-) mice restores the CD8(+) T cell development. Restored CD8+ T cells are
functionally mature in terms of allogeneic MLR and cytokine production. In
contrast to thymus-derived CD8+ T cells, other lymphocyte subsets including NK,
NK T, and TCR-gammadelta(+) intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, which are
also impaired in IRF-1(-/-) mice, are not rescued by expressing human Bcl-2. Our 
results indicate that IRF-1 differentially regulates the development of these
lymphocyte subsets and that survival signals involving Bcl-2 are critical for the
development of thymus-dependent CD8+ T cells.

Tumor cell-specific inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase activation by
tiazofurin.

Samardzic T(1), Stosic-Grujicic S, Raicevic N, Trajkovic V.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Biological Research Sinisa Stankovic, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

The effects of tiazofurin (TR) on proliferation and cytokine-induced nitric oxide
(NO) production in the L929 fibrosarcoma cell line and murine embryonic
fibroblasts were investigated. Treatment with TR inhibited the growth of
nonconfluent L929 cells in a dose-dependent manner. TR, at concentrations not
affecting cell viability or proliferation, markedly decreased IFN-gamma +
LPS-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA and, subsequently, NO
production in confluent L929 cultures. However, TR did not interfere with the
IFN-gamma-triggered expression of mRNA for IRF-1, an important iNOS transcription
factor, implying that TR interferes with some other intracellular pathway
involved in iNOS induction triggered by IFN-gamma + LPS. In contrast to the
results obtained in L929 cells, iNOS mRNA expression induced by IFN-gamma + LPS
in murine embryonic fibroblasts was resistant to TR, indicating a tumor-selective
action of this agent.

IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) regulates the IFN system, inhibits cell growth,
and has tumor-suppressor activities. p21 is a universal cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor, the induction of which depends on both p53 and IRF-1 in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts. The expression of p21 in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) 
is regulated by wild-type p53. We examined the expressions of IRF-1 and p21 in 32
HCCs by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and the mutation p53 gene in 32
HCCs by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The
expression of IRF-1 mRNA in 15 of 32 HCCs was lower than that in adjacent
noncancerous tissue. IRF-1 mRNA expression was reduced in 0 of 3 specimens of
well-differentiated HCC, 9 of 21 (42%) specimens of moderately differentiated
HCC, and 6 of 8 (75%) specimens of poorly differentiated HCC. IRF-1 mRNA
expression was significantly lower in tumors with portal thrombus than in those
without portal thrombus (P = 0.003). p53 mutations were detected in 7 of 32 HCCS:
p21 expression was reduced in 6 of the 7 (86%) HCCs with p53 mutations. In
contrast, p21 expression was reduced in 13 of 25 (52%) HCCs with wild-type p53.
IRF-1 expression was reduced in 7 of 13 (53%) HCCs with both wild-type p53 and
reduced expression of p21. These results suggest that IRF-1 may be a
tumor-suppressor gene for HCC and that IRF-1 is related to p21 expression in HCC 
with wild-type p53.

Nitric oxide synthase 2 through an autocrine loop via respiratory epithelial
cell-derived mediator.

Uetani K(1), Thomassen MJ, Erzurum SC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Lerner Research Institute,
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

Respiratory epithelium expresses nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) continuously in
vivo; however, mechanisms responsible for its expression are only partially
understood. We definitively identify an autocrine mechanism of induction and
maintenance of NOS2 in human airway epithelial cells through the synthesis and
secretion of a soluble mediator. Short exposure of human airway cells to
interferon (IFN)-gamma leads to prolonged NOS2 expression. Transfer of the
overlying culture medium (conditioned medium) induces NOS2 expression in other
airway epithelial cells, suggesting the presence of an intermediary substance
regulating NOS2 expression in an autocrine loop. Characterization of the soluble 
mediator reveals that it is stable and transferable in conditioned medium for up 
to 7 days. However, soluble mediator does not induce NOS2 mRNA in human alveolar 
macrophages, indicating that the response to soluble mediator is unique to human 
respiratory epithelium. Soluble mediator is heat labile but is not inactivated by
acid treatment, unlike IFN-gamma itself. Importantly, IFN regulatory factor-1,
which is critical for murine NOS2 expression, is expressed and activated by
soluble mediator through the signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1-dependent pathway. Based on these findings, we propose novel
regulatory mechanisms for NOS2 expression in human airway epithelium.

RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR is required for activation of NF-kappa B by
IFN-gamma in a STAT1-independent pathway.

Deb A(1), Haque SJ, Mogensen T, Silverman RH, Williams BR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cancer Biology, The Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

The IFN-inducible dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR regulates protein synthesis 
through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha. It also acts as a
signal transducer for transcription factors NF-kappaB, IFN regulatory factor-1,
and activating transcription factor-2. IFN-gamma, a pleiotropic cytokine, elicits
gene expression by activating the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway. IFN-gamma 
can synergize with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kappaB in a number of cell lines.
Here we show that IFN-gamma alone can activate NF-kappaB, by a Janus
kinase-1-mediated, but Stat1-independent, mechanism. NF-kappaB activation by
IFN-gamma is associated with degradation of IkappaB beta. The IFN-gamma response 
can be blocked by 2',5'-oligoadenylate-linked antisense chimeras against PKR
mRNA. There was no activation of NF-kappaB by IFN in PKR-null cells, indicating
that PKR is required for IFN-gamma signaling to NF-kappaB.

Functional correction of FA-C cells with FANCC suppresses the expression of
interferon gamma-inducible genes.

Medical Genetics, and the Oregon Cancer Center, Oregon Health Sciences
University, Portland, OR, USA.

Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia (FA) patients of the
C-complementation group (FA-C) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of
interferon gamma (IFNgamma), the products of certain IFNgamma-inducible genes
known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified. High constitutive
expression of the IFNgamma-inducible genes, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma
subunit (ISGF3gamma), IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1) was found in FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts, low-density 
bone marrow cells, and murine embryonic fibroblasts. Paradoxically, these cells
do not activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1
properly. In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA-C cells overexpress
IFNgamma-inducible genes in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation, it was
reasoned that decreased levels of activated STAT1 might result in reduced
expression of a hematopoietic IFNgamma-responsive protein that normally modulates
expression of other IFNgamma-responsive genes. Levels of the IFNgamma-inducible
factor IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), a negative trans-acting
regulator of some IFNgamma-inducible genes, were quantified. ICSBP levels were
reduced in FA-C B lymphoblasts and MEFs. However, enforced expression of ICSBP
failed to down-regulate IRF-1, ISGF3gamma, and p21(WAF1). Thus, the FANCC protein
functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are
inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic
inhibition, but it does so independently of the classic IFN-STAT1 pathway and is 
not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression and localization of IRF-1 in human
endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle.
DESIGN: A comparative study.
SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kyoto Prefectural University of
Medicine.
PATIENTS: Thirty-eight women aged 33 to 46 years, with regular menstrual cycles
and nonpathological endometrium, undergoing hysterectomy.
INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial tissues were obtained from operative samples.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Expression of IRF-1 mRNA throughout the menstrual cycle 
was investigated using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction. Localization of IRF-1 protein was determined using
immunohistochemistry.
RESULT(S): IRF-1 mRNA was expressed in the human endometrium at each phase of the
menstrual cycle. The immunoreactivity for IRF-1 was observed in the extranuclear 
compartment of the surface and glandular epithelial cells, both during the
proliferative and secretory phases, as well as in the gland secretion during the 
secretory phase. In contrast, stromal cells were nearly unstained.
CONCLUSION(S): IRF-1 was localized in the human endometrium, implying that this
nuclear protein plays some role other than as a transcription factor.

Activated macrophages play a central role in antitumor immunity. However, the
stimuli that activate macrophages to kill tumor cells are not completely
understood. Because the center of solid tumors can be hypoxic, we hypothesized
that hypoxia may be an important signal in activating macrophages to kill tumor
cells. Hypoxia stimulates IFN-primed macrophages to express the inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (NOS2) and to synthesize nitric oxide (NO). We show that this
synergy between IFN and hypoxia is mediated by the direct interaction of the
hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which are
both required for the hypoxic transcription of NOS2. This interaction between
HIF-1 and IRF-1 may explain the mechanism by which macrophages infiltrating into 
tumors are activated to express NOS2 and to produce NO, a mediator of tumor
apoptosis.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) were initially identified as regulators of
IFN-alpha/beta genes and to date nine members have been determined in human and
mouse. They share a conserved DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal portion that
recognizes similar DNA sequences. Despite their similar DNA binding specificity, 
the IRFs show diverse functions in response to extra cellular stimuli. Although
the study of IRFs was started with respect to regulation of the IFN-alpha/beta
gene expression, recent studies have revealed other aspects of IRF functions. In 
this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the functions of IRF family
members revealed by our gene targeting study in mice, focusing on the regulation 
of the IFN system.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2
(IRF-1 and IRF-2) in human breast cancer.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2 are transcription 
factors in the interferon gamma signal transduction pathway. IRF-1 acts as the
effector arm of the interferon gamma response; IRF-2 binds to the same DNA
consensus sequence and opposes IRF-1 activity. Previous work in the authors'
laboratory has shown the tumor suppressor activity of IRF-1 expression and the
oncogenic effect of IRF-2 in human and murine tumor models, including human
breast cancer cell lines. The authors' hypothesis is that this pathway is
involved in human tumor development, and alterations in the expression of IRF-1
and IRF-2 may occur in breast cancer tissue compared with normal breast tissue,
and between more and less differentiated breast cancers.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human archival tissue specimens were
obtained from 33 patients with pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 49 women 
with invasive ductal cancer. Adjacent areas of normal breast tissue were assayed 
in 31 women. These specimens were stained with polyclonal IRF-1 and IRF-2
antibodies using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique after epitope
retrieval.
RESULTS: Most normal breast tissue showed expression of IRF-1 and no expression
of IRF-2 by immunohistochemistry. High-grade DCIS or node-positive invasive
ductal cancers were less likely to express the tumor suppressor IRF-1 than normal
tissue. More strikingly, high-grade DCIS and invasive ductal cancers were much
more likely to express the oncogenic IRF-2 protein than was normal tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of IRF-1 and IRF-2 is altered in human breast cancer
compared with normal adjacent tissue. The loss of IRF-1 expression is consistent 
with tumor suppressor loss and the development of IRF-2 expression with oncogenic
activation. These data support the hypothesis that this pathway is involved in
human breast oncogenesis, which warrants further investigation regarding
prognostic and therapeutic implications.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the involvement of candidate cytokine genes in the
pathogenesis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms and intragenic microsatellite markers
within 8 candidate cytokine genes (interleukin-1alpha [IL-1alpha], IL-2, IL-4,
IL-6, IL-10, interferon-alpha1 [IFNA1], interferon-gamma [IFNG], and interferon
regulatory factor 1 [IRF-1]) were investigated in 417 Caucasian patients with
clinically characterized JIA and a panel of 276 unrelated, healthy Caucasian
controls, all from the United Kingdom.
RESULTS: A novel 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) polymorphism in IRF-1 was found
to be associated with susceptibility to JIA (corrected P = 0.002). No significant
association with IL-1alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFNA1, or IFNG was observed.
CONCLUSION: An association between JIA and a previously unreported 3'UTR
polymorphism of IRF-1 was observed. This association was not found to be specific
to any particular JIA subgroup. This suggests that IRF-1 may contribute to a
common pathogenesis shared by all JIA patients, regardless of clinical phenotype.
This is most likely to be a genetic contribution to the chronic inflammatory
process that underlies JIA pathology.

Requirement for STAT1 in LPS-induced gene expression in macrophages.

Ohmori Y(1), Hamilton TA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA. ohmorih@ccf.org

This study examines the role of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1) in induction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated gene 
expression both in vitro and in vivo. LPS-induced expression of an interferon
(IFN)-inducible 10-kDa protein (IP-10), IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNAs was severely impaired in macrophages
prepared from Stat1-/- mice, whereas levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and KC
(a C-X-C chemokine) mRNA in LPS-treated cell cultures were unaffected. A similar 
deficiency in LPS-induced gene expression was observed in livers and spleens from
Stat1-/- mice. The reduced LPS-stimulated gene expression seen in Stat1-/-
macrophages was not the result of reduced activation of nuclear factor kappaB.
LPS stimulated the delayed activation of both IFN-stimulated response element and
IFN-gamma-activated sequence binding activity in macrophages from wild-type mice.
Activation of these STAT1-containing transcription factors was mediated by the
intermediate induction of type I IFNs, since the LPS-induced IP-10, IRF-1, and
iNOS mRNA expression was markedly reduced in macrophages from IFN-alpha/betaR-/- 
mice and blocked by cotreatment with antibodies against type I IFN. These results
indicate that indirect activation of STAT1 by LPS-induced type I IFN participates
in promoting optimal expression of LPS-inducible genes, and they suggest that
STAT1 may play a critical role in innate immunity against gram-negative bacterial
infection.

Coactivator p300 acetylates the interferon regulatory factor-2 in U937 cells
following phorbol ester treatment.

Masumi A(1), Ozato K.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Safety Research on Biologics, National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Tokyo 208-0011, Japan.

Interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) is a transcription factor of the IRF
family that represses interferon-mediated gene expression. In the present study, 
we show that human monocytic U937 cells express truncated forms of IRF-2
containing the DNA binding domain but lacking much of the C-terminal regulatory
domain. U937 cells are shown to respond to phorbol ester
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to induce expression of histone
acetylases p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). In addition, TPA treatment
led to the appearance of full-length IRF-2, along with a reduction of the
truncated protein. Interestingly, full-length IRF-2 in TPA-treated U937 cells
occurred as a complex with p300 as well as PCAF and was itself acetylated.
Consistent with these results, recombinant IRF-2 was acetylated by p300 and to a 
lesser degree by PCAF in vitro. Another IRF member, IRF-1, an activator of
interferon-mediated transcription, was also acetylated in vitro by these
acetylases. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of IRF-2 but not IRF-1
inhibits core histone acetylation by p300 in vitro. The addition of IRF-2 also
inhibited acetylation of nucleosomal histones in TPA-treated U937 cells.
Acetylated IRF-2 may affect local chromatin structure in vivo by inhibiting core 
histone acetylation and may serve as a mechanism by which IRF-2 negatively
regulates interferon-inducible transcription.

Growth suppression of the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hepa1-6 by an
activatable interferon regulatory factor-1 in mice.

Biotechnologische Forschung, Freiburg, Germany.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with a poor prognosis 
and few therapeutic options. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential
of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) for cytokine gene therapy of HCC using an
IRF-1/human estrogen receptor fusion protein (IRF-1hER), which is reversibly
activatable by beta-estradiol (E2). IRF-1hER stably expressing murine Hepa1-6 HCC
cells (HepaIRF-1hER) were characterized by lowMHC 1, highCD54, and lack of MHC
II, CD80, and CD86 expression. Activation of HepaIRF-1hER cells induced a highMHC
I, lowMHC II, and highCD54 phenotype. Furthermore, they were characterized by
IFN-beta secretion, decreased anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar assay, 
and diminished cell growth. Tumor growth in E2-treated syngeneic C57L/J mice, but
not in E2-untreated mice, was suppressed. These E2-treated mice were protected
against rechallenge with HepaIRF-1hER and wild-type Hepa1-6 tumors even in the
absence of E2, suggesting induction of tumor specific immunity. In fact,
significant CTL activity against Hepa1-6 tumors and the endogenously expressed
HCC-specific self antigen alpha-fetoprotein was observed. Antitumoral effects,
however, were only partially dependent on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. IRF-1
treatment of mice bearing HepaIRF-1hER tumors resulted in growth arrest of
tumors, and a significant survival benefit was observed in comparison to
E2-untreated mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that IRF-1 suppresses HCC 
growth through both a direct antitumor growth effect and enhanced immune cell
recognition of the tumor and is a promising candidate for gene therapy of HCC.

The cell cycle control element of histone H4 gene transcription is maximally
responsive to interferon regulatory factor pairs IRF-1/IRF-3 and IRF-1/IRF-7.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcriptional mediators of
interferon-responsive signaling pathways that are involved in antiviral defense, 
immune response, and cell growth regulation. To investigate the role of IRF
proteins in the regulation of histone H4 gene transcription, we compared the
transcriptional contributions of IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, and IRF-7 using transient
transfection assays with H4 promoter/luciferase (Luc) reporter genes. These IRF
proteins up-regulate reporter gene expression but IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 are
more potent activators of the H4 promoter than IRF-2. Forced expression of
different IRF combinations reveals that IRF-2 reduces IRF-1 or IRF-3 dependent
activation, but does not affect IRF-7 function. Thus, IRF-2 may have a dual
function in histone H4 gene transcription by acting as a weak activator at low
dosage and a competitive inhibitor of other strongly activating IRFs at high
levels. IRF-1/IRF-3 and IRF-1/IRF-7 pairs each mediate the highest levels of site
II-dependent promoter activity and can up-regulate transcription by 120-150-fold.
We also find that interferon gamma up-regulates IRF-1 and site II-dependent
promoter activity. This up-regulation is not observed when the IRF site is
mutated or if cells are preloaded with IRF-1. Our results indicate that IRF-1,
IRF-2, IRF-3, and IRF-7 can all regulate histone H4 gene expression. The pairwise
utilization of distinct IRF factors provides a flexible transcriptional mechanism
for integration of diverse growth-related signaling pathways.

Interferon gamma (IFNgamma ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha synergism in ME-180 
cervical cancer cell apoptosis and necrosis. IFNgamma inhibits cytoprotective
NF-kappa B through STAT1/IRF-1 pathways.

We investigated the molecular mechanism of the synergism between interferon gamma
(IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) documented in a variety of 
biological occasions such as tumor cell death and inflammatory responses.
IFNgamma/TNFalpha synergistically induced apoptosis of ME-180 cervical cancer
cells. IFNgamma induced STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon regulatory factor 1 
(IRF-1) expression. Transfection of phosphorylation-defective STAT1 inhibited
IFNgamma/TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, whereas IRF-1 transfection induced
susceptibility to TNFalpha. Dominant-negative IkappaBalpha transfection
sensitized ME-180 cells to TNFalpha. IFNgamma pretreatment attenuated TNFalpha-
or p65-induced NF-kappaB reporter activity, whereas it did not inhibit p65
translocation or DNA binding of NF-kappaB. IRF-1 transfection alone inhibited
TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity, which was reversed by coactivator p300
overexpression. Caspases were activated by IFNgamma/TNFalpha combination;
however, caspase inhibition did not abrogate IFNgamma/TNFalpha-induced cell
death. Instead, caspase inhibitors directed IFNgamma/TNFalpha-treated ME-180
cells to undergo necrosis, as demonstrated by Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide
staining and electron microscopy. Taken together, our results indicate that
IFNgamma and TNFalpha synergistically act to destroy ME-180 tumor cells by either
apoptosis or necrosis, depending on caspase activation, and STAT1/IRF-1 pathways 
initiated by IFNgamma play a critical role in IFNgamma/TNFalpha synergism by
inhibiting cytoprotective NF-kappaB. IFNgamma/TNFalpha synergism appears to
activate cell death machinery independently of caspase activation, and caspase
activation seems to merely determine the mode of cell death.

Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.

Interferon (IFN)-alpha is a family of antiviral proteins encoded by different
genes. The biological significance of the existence of various IFN-alpha subtypes
is not clear. We have investigated the interferon system in chronic hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection, a disease that responds to interferon-alpha2 therapy in
only a limited proportion of cases. We analysed the expression of interferon
regulatory factor (IRF)-1, IRF-2, and IFN-alpha subtypes in nonstimulated and
Sendai virus-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HCV
infected patients and healthy controls. We observed that the IRF-1 mRNA and
IRF-1/IRF-2 ratios were increased in PBMC from hepatitis C patients with respect 
to normal subjects. Sendai virus stimulation of PBMC led to a significant
increase in the levels of IRF-1, IRF-2 and IFN-alpha mRNAs and in the production 
of IFN-alpha protein with respect to basal values in healthy controls as well as 
in patients with HCV infection. In addition, we found that while natural HCV
infection induced increased IFN-alpha5 expression in PBMC, in vitro infection of 
these cells with Sendai virus caused a raise in the expression of IFN-alpha8 in
both patients and normal controls. In summary, our results indicate that
virus-induced activation of the IFN system in human PBMC is associated with
selective expression of individual IFN-alpha subtypes, IFN-alpha5 being the
specific subtype induced in PBMC from patients with chronic HCV infection.

Previous studies indicate that human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) arises from
a rare population of leukemic stem cells. Cells of this nature can initiate and
maintain leukemic cell growth in both long-term cultures and nonobese
diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient mice. To characterize the biology of
primitive AML cells, gene expression screens were performed with 7 primary AML
and 3 normal specimens. For each sample, stem cell populations (CD34(+)/CD38(-)) 
were isolated and used to synthesize radiolabeled complementary DNA (cDNA). AML
vs normal probes were then hybridized to cDNA arrays containing genes related to 
cancer and apoptosis. Of approximately 1400 genes analyzed, 2 tumor-suppressor
genes were identified that were overexpressed in all 7 of the AML CD34(+)/CD38(-)
cell populations: death-associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory
factor 1. Expression of each gene was confirmed by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis. It is proposed that
tumor-suppressor proteins play a role in the biology of primitive AML cells.

Suppression of Il-12 transcription in macrophages following Fc gamma receptor
ligation.

Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.

Ligating Fc gamma R on macrophages results in suppression of IL-12 production. We
show that Fc gamma R ligation selectively down-regulates IL-12 p40 and p35 gene
expression at the level of transcription. The region responsive to this
inhibition maps to the Ets site of the p40 promoter. PU.1, IFN consensus sequence
binding protein, and c-REL: form a complex on this element upon macrophage
activation. Receptor ligation abolishes the binding of this PU.1-containing
activation complex, and abrogates p40 transcription. A dominant-negative
construct of PU.1 diminishes IL-12 p40 promoter activity and endogenous IL-12 p40
protein secretion. Thus, the specificity of IL-12 down-regulation following
receptor ligation lies in the inhibition of binding of a PU.1-containing complex 
to the Ets site of the IL-12 promoter. These findings provide evidence
demonstrating for the first time the importance of PU.1 in the transcriptional
regulation of IL-12 gene expression.

IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha synergism as the final effector in autoimmune diabetes: a key
role for STAT1/IFN regulatory factor-1 pathway in pancreatic beta cell death.

Fas ligand (FasL), perforin, TNF-alpha, IL-1, and NO have been considered as
effector molecule(s) leading to beta cell death in autoimmune diabetes. However, 
the real culprit(s) in beta cell destruction have long been elusive, despite
intense investigation. We and others have demonstrated that FasL is not a major
effector molecule in autoimmune diabetes, and previous inability to transfer
diabetes to Fas-deficient nonobese diabetic (NOD)-lpr mice was due to
constitutive FasL expression on lymphocytes from these mice. Here, we identified 
IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha synergism as the final effector molecules in autoimmune
diabetes of NOD mice. A combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but neither
cytokine alone, induced classical caspase-dependent apoptosis in insulinoma and
pancreatic islet cells. IFN-gamma treatment conferred susceptibility to
TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis on otherwise resistant insulinoma cells by STAT1
activation followed by IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 induction. IRF-1 played a
central role in IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity because inhibition of
IRF-1 induction by antisense oligonucleotides blocked IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha-induced
cytotoxicity, and transfection of IRF-1 rendered insulinoma cells susceptible to 
TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity. STAT1 and IRF-1 were expressed in pancreatic
islets of diabetic NOD mice and colocalized with apoptotic cells. Moreover,
anti-TNF-alpha Ab inhibited the development of diabetes after adoptive transfer. 
Taken together, our results indicate that IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha synergism is
responsible for autoimmune diabetes in vivo as well as beta cell apoptosis in
vitro and suggest a novel signal transduction in IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha synergism
that may have relevance in other autoimmune diseases and synergistic anti-tumor
effects of the two cytokines.

Linkage and association of polymorphic markers in the chromosome 5q31-q33
cytokine cluster to atopy and asthma associated phenotypes have been reported by 
a number of groups. To investigate this region, 29 polymorphic markers were used 
to genotype a combined set of 233 families. These markers were ordered based upon
the genetic data, supplemented by published genetic and physical maps.
Significant two-point linkage was observed for asthma (most significant marker
IRF1, P = 0.0002) and atopy (CD14SNP, P = 0.0001). Allelic association was
observed between D5S463 and atopy (P = 0.002) and the skin prick test index (P = 
0.04). The data support the possibility of three asthma/atopy loci in the
5q31-q33 region, each with a relatively small effect.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) constitute a family of transcription factors
that commonly possess a novel helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Following the
initial identification of two structurally related members, IRF-1 and IRF-2,
seven additional members have now been reported. In addition, virally encoded
IRFs, which may interfere with cellular IRFs, have also been identified. Thus
far, intensive functional analyses have been done on IRF-1, revealing a
remarkable functional diversity of this transcription factor in the regulation of
cellular response in host defense. Indeed, IRF-1 selectively modulates different 
sets of genes, depending on the cell type and/or the nature of cellular stimuli, 
in order to evoke appropriate responses in each. More recently, much attention
has also been focused on other IRF family members. Their functional roles,
through interactions with their own or other members of the family of
transcription factors, are becoming clearer in the regulation of host defense,
such as innate and adaptive immune responses and oncogenesis.

BACKGROUND: IFN-gamma and related molecules play important roles in the
differentiation and function of TH2 cells.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether IFNG and related genes contribute to
any susceptibility to atopic asthma, a representative TH2-dominant disorder.
METHODS: We investigated the association of IFNG (CA repeat polymorphism within
the first intron), IRF1 (GT repeat polymorphism within the intron 7), IFNGR1 (Val
14 Met), and IFNGR2 (Gln 64 Arg) gene polymorphisms with atopic asthma in the
Japanese child population.
RESULTS: A significant association (P =.0018) was observed between IFNG gene
polymorphism and atopic asthma. The tendency was more prominent in patients with 
age of onset of 3 years or younger (P =.0004) or patients with a family history
of allergic diseases (P =.0038). Furthermore, there was a significant association
between IRF1 gene whole-allele distribution and atopic asthma (P =.044). The
tendency was more prominent in patients with onset at 3 years of age or less (P
=.0058). On the other hand, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 gene polymorphisms showed no
association with atopic asthma.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that among IFNG and related genes, IFNG and
IRF1 genes confer genetic susceptibility to atopic asthma in Japanese children.

In accordance with the key role of MHC class I molecules in the adaptive immune
response against viruses, they are expressed by most cells, and their expression 
can be enhanced by cytokines. The assembly and cell surface expression of class I
complexes depend on a continuous peptide supply. The peptides are generated
mainly by the proteasome and are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum by a
peptide transport pump consisting of two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2. The proteasome 
low molecular weight polypeptide (2 and 7), as well as TAP (1 and 2) genes, are
coordinately regulated and are induced by IFNs. Despite this coordinate
regulation, examination of tumors shows that these genes can be discordantly
down-regulated. In pursuing a molecular explanation for these observations, we
have characterized the mouse TAP2 promoter region and 5'-flanking sequence. We
show that the 5' untranslated regions of TAP2 genes have a characteristic genomic
organization that is conserved in both the mouse and the human. The mouse TAP2
promoter belongs to a class of promoters that lack TATA boxes but contain a MED1 
(multiple start site element downstream) sequence. Accordingly, transcription is 
initiated from multiple sites within a 100-nucleotide window. An IFN regulatory
factor 1 (IRF1)/IRF2 binding site is located in this region and is involved in
both basal and IRF1-induced TAP2 promoter activity. The implication of the
extensive differences found among the promoters of class I heavy chain, low
molecular weight polypeptide, and TAP genes, all encoding proteins involved in Ag
presentation, is discussed.

Multiple signaling cascades are differentially involved in gene induction by
double stranded RNA in interferon-alpha-primed cells.

Priming with interfon (IFN)alpha enhanced the ability of the synthetic
double-stranded RNA polyriboinosinic acid: polyribocytidilic acid (pI:C), but not
interleukin-1 beta, to activate both p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascades. Activation by
pI:C in IFN alpha-primed cells was delayed compared to activation with
interleukin-1 beta, and this delay was followed by high, sustained activation of 
p38 MAPK and a modest elevation of ERK activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of
either the ERK or the p38 MAPK pathway, using U0126 and SB203580, respectively,
reduced interleukin-6 protein induction by at least 70%, and combined inhibition 
of both pathways fully blocked interleukin-6 protein expression and reduced
interleukin-6 mRNA induction by more than 80%. In contrast, induction of
double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) mRNA and protein by IFN alpha 
and/or pI:C was minimally affected by either inhibitor. Induction of
interferon-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) by pI:C in IFN alpha primed cells was
profoundly inhibited by U0126 but not by SB203580. Thus, IFN alpha priming
enhances activation of p38 MAPK and ERK pathways by pI:C but not by interleukin-1
beta, thereby enhancing the expression of some, but not all, genes that are
induced by pI:C.

Antiviral response in cells containing Stat1 with heterologous transactivation
domains.

The STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), latent
cytoplasmic transcription factors, are activated by binding of extracellular
polypeptides to cell surface receptors. Dimerization, accumulation in the
nucleus, and transcriptional inductions of specific genes then occur. The COOH
terminus of the STATs acts as a transcriptional activation domain (TAD). Stat1,
one of seven mammalian STAT genes, forms a homodimer after activation by gamma
interferon and induces transcription of a number of genes. These induced genes in
turn produce the antiviral state. In the present experiments we used a
Stat1-deficient cell line complemented with Stat1 or various fusion constructs in
which the wild-type Stat1 TAD was replaced by other TADs to test the possibility 
that a specific activating domain was necessary for the induction of the
antiviral response. We found that a wide variety of TADs with different
activation potential appended to the Stat1 COOH terminus could substitute for the
wild-type protein in inducing the antiviral state.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional inducer of the
interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene and other interferon-stimulated genes. A GT
repeat polymorphism in the 7th intron of the IRF-1 gene was used as a marker to
test for association with multiple sclerosis (MS) in a case-control study
including individuals from Germany, Northern Italy and Sweden. In none of these
populations, did we find any significant allelic association with disease. This
lack of association was confirmed by testing transmission disequilibrium of
individual IRF1 alleles in a representative sample of Sardinian simplex MS
families. No deviation of the expected 50% transmission rates was seen.
Therefore, our work does not provide evidence in favor of IRF1 being a candidate 
for conferring genetic susceptibility to, or protection against, MS in Europe.

[Gene expression in white blood cells in chronic myeloid leukemia].

[Article in Czech]

BACKGROUND: The new technologies that have the DNA laboratory over recent years
and the general progress in knowledge of the human genome, have allowed the
simultaneous observation of the activity of a large number of genes. Chronic
myeloid leukemia is characterized with abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of the
fused bcr/abl gene, which is most often product of translocation between
chromosomes 9 an 22. It is as yet unknown whether this is the only and sufficient
cause of the disease, or whether other supporting and co-active abnormalities
exist. It is also not yet clear whether an increase of proliferating activity or 
reduced programmed cell death plays the dominant role. The aim of this study was 
to make further steps in resolving the question as to which of these hypotheses
fits better.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Membrane macroarrays (Clontech 7742-1: Human Cancer cDNA
Expression Array with 588 gene probes) were used throughout the study, on which
cDNA reverse-transcribed from total RNA in turn isolated from peripheral white
blood cells and labelled with 32P was hybridized. Cells obtained from 5 patients 
with confirmed diagnoses by cytogenetic and molecular (bcr/abl) analyses, but who
had not yet been treated by chemotherapy, were the source of the material. In
some cases mononuclears and granulocytes were also isolated by Ficoll-Paque
centrifugation. Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography or by a
Phosphorimager (Fujifilm FLA-2000). Comparison with normal gene expression
(healthy donor) was made by subtraction using Clontech AtlaImage 1.5 software.
Although changes of expression of identical genes were not observed in all of
patients examined, the majority of them were concordant. Values at least double
those of the controls applied to the activity of c-jun N-terminal kinase, MMP-8, 
MMP-9, integrin alpha E, integrin beta and PDGF, whereas the expression of
ZAP-70, IRF1, MCL-1, STAT 5B, RARA, CDC25B, RPSA, TNFR decreased. Increases of
PCNA, MMP-17, CD59, rho G, CRAF1 and PIG7 or decreases of notch, caspase 8,
caspase 4, interleukin 6 receptor, rho B and TIMP1 were observed only in some
cell samples.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that some maturation processes and transmembrane signalling
are blocked, as well as the effectors of apoptosis. On the other hand, the
reduced activity of ZAP-70, IRF1 and MCL-1 also indicated that proliferation
breaks were weakened. The involvement of both processes-released replication and 
ineffective apoptosis--was evident; the problem of bcr/abl gene fusion being the 
necessary first and sufficient step on the way towards developing chronic myeloid
leukemia, however, remained unresolved.

Lack of gastritis and of an adaptive immune response in interferon regulatory
factor-1-deficient mice infected with Helicobacter pylori.

Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany. sommerf@mailer.uni-marburg.de

To study the role of T cell responses in Helicobacter pylori gastritis, C57BL/6
wild-type and interferon regulatory factor-1-deficient (IRF-1(-/-)) mice were
infected with the mouse-adapted H. pylori Sydney strain. Mice lacking the
transcription factor IRF-1 are defective in Th1 development and are therefore
biased to mount a Th2-type response. After 4 months of infection, C57BL/6 mice
developed severe gastritis and atrophy and mounted a Th1-type response towards H.
pylori. The Th1 response was abrogated in IRF-1(-/-) mice. This defective Th1
response was associated with the total lack of gastritis and atrophy in
IRF-1(-/-) mice despite severe colonization with H. pylori. In addition,
IRF-1(-/-) mice did also not develop a Th2 reaction, since they failed to
generate H. pylori-specific antibodies and to produce IL-4 in response to H.
pylori antigens in vitro. Thus, the transcription factor IRF-1 is necessary for
the development of gastritis and atrophy in H. pylori-infected wild-type mice,
suggesting a role of Th1 cells in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated
diseases.

Role of interferon regulatory factor-1 in the regulation of IL-18 production and 
activity.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor regulating the
expression of several cytokines. Using IRF-1 knockout (KO) mice, the role of
IRF-1 in the production and activity of IL-18 was evaluated. Administration of
IL-12 or concanavalin A significantly increased levels of circulating IL-18 in
wild-type (WT), but not in IRF-1 KO mice. However, despite these differences in
circulating IL-18 levels, no or only minor differences in constitutive or
inducible IL-18 mRNA and tissue-associated protein levels were observed between
WT and IRF-1 KO mice. On the other hand, we observed that constitutive and
inducible levels of the IL-18-processing enzyme caspase-1 were markedly reduced
in the spleen and the liver of IRF-1 KO compared to WT mice. In addition, both
constitutive and inducible liver mRNA levels for the IL-18 binding protein
(IL-18BP), a specific IL-18 antagonist, were significantly lower in IRF-1 KO than
in WT mice. Compared to IL-12, IL-18 only weakly induced IRF-1 mRNA in cultured
splenocytes. However, IL-18-induced IFN-gamma production was strongly reduced in 
splenocytes from IRF-1 KO compared to WT cells. In conclusion, IRF-1 regulates
IL-18 production and activity mostly by modulating expression of caspase-1 and
IL-18BP. In addition, IRF-1 participates in the induction of IFN-gamma by IL-18.

The tumour suppressor IRF-1 is a transcription factor involved in the induction
of apoptosis in several in vitro systems. Post-lactational involution of the
mammary gland is characterized by extensive apoptosis of the epithelial cells. We
have previously shown that signal transducer and activator of transcription
(Stat) 3 drives apoptosis and involution in the mouse mammary gland. Since one of
the downstream targets of the Stat signalling pathway is IRF-1, we have used
IRF-1 knockout mice to address the potential role of this transcription factor in
involution. Surprisingly, in the absence of IRF-1 significantly higher numbers of
apoptotic cells were found in involuting glands at 48 h compared to control
glands. In addition, the alveolar structure in IRF-1 null mammary glands had
collapsed whereas in control glands the alveoli remained intact and distended.
However, by 72 h control and null glands were morphologically similar suggesting 
that IRF-1 suppresses apoptosis only during the early, reversible, stage of
involution. This suggests a survival role for IRF-1 in mammary epithelia and
demonstrates a novel role for IRF-1 in vivo--suppression of premature epithelial 
apoptosis during mammary gland involution.

CD2 stimulation leads to the delayed and prolonged activation of STAT1 in T cells
but not NK cells.

Mahajan S(1), Gollob JA, Ritz J, Frank DA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, 
USA.

OBJECTIVE: T lymphocytes can be activated by soluble factors such as cytokines or
through direct cell-cell interactions. Although cytokine receptors are known to
signal through STAT family transcription factors, the mechanisms by which other
cell-surface molecules, such as CD2, transduce signals is unclear. The goal of
this study was to determine whether stimulation of T cells through CD2
recapitulates aspects of cytokine-induced T-cell activation by use of STAT
transcription factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: T cells were treated with anti-CD2 antibodies or cells
bearing the natural CD2 ligand CD58, after which signaling through STAT
transcription factors was assessed.
RESULTS: Stimulation of CD2 on primary T lymphocytes leads to the tyrosine
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of STAT1. In contrast to 
stimulation by cytokines, the activation of STAT1 in response to CD2 ligation is 
delayed and does not involve Jak kinases. Furthermore, while STAT phosphorylation
induced by cytokines is generally transient, STAT1 phosphorylation following CD2 
stimulation persists for a period of days. Transcription of key target genes such
as IRF1 and c-fos proceeds with delayed kinetics following CD2 stimulation,
suggesting that this unique pattern of STAT activation may lead to a distinct
cellular response following CD2 ligation. This pathway appears to be restricted
to T cells, as stimulation of CD2 on NK cells does not lead to STAT1 activation.
CONCLUSION: Stimulation of T cells through cell-surface molecules such as CD2
involves activation of STAT transcription factors, thus recapitulating elements
of cytokine signaling.

Prolactin activation of IRF-1 transcription involves changes in histone
acetylation.

Book McAlexander M(1), Yu-Lee L.

(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine,
Houston, TX 77030, USA.

In response to prolactin (PRL) signaling, transcription of the interferon
regulatory factor-1 gene (IRF-1) is rapidly induced during early G(1), declines
in mid G(1), and rises again over the G(1)/S transition phase of the cell cycle
in Nb2 T cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that histone 
H4 acetylation increases over a 1.7 kb region of the IRF-1 promoter in early G(1)
and again at the G(1)/S transition in response to PRL stimulation. These results 
demonstrate a correlation between histone H4 hyperacetylation at the IRF-1
promoter and biphasic transcription of IRF-1 in response to PRL signaling in
vivo.

Immune response in Stat2 knockout mice.

Park C(1), Li S, Cha E, Schindler C.

Author information:

USA.

Type I IFNs induce gene expression through Stat1 and Stat2, which can in turn
associate either to form Stat1 homodimers or the transcription factor ISGF-3.
Stat1 homodimers also transduce signals for IFN-gamma. To explore the unique
properties of Stat2 and ISGF-3 in type I IFN signaling, its gene was targeted for
deletion. Stat2 null mice exhibit a number of defects in immune response. This
includes an increased susceptibility to viral infection and the loss of a type I 
IFN autocrine/ paracrine loop, which in turn regulates several aspects of immune 
response. Intriguingly, Stat2-deficient fibroblasts exhibit a more significant
defect in their response to type I IFNs than macrophages, highlighting
tissue-specific differences in the response to this family of ligands.

STAT1 is required for iNOS activation, but not IL-6 production in murine
fibroblasts.

The role of transcription factor STAT1 in production of pro-inflammatory
mediators nitric oxide (NO) and IL-6 was examined in murine embryonic
fibroblasts. While cells from wild-type animals released large amounts of NO
after stimulation with IFN-gamma in combination with LPS, TNF-alpha or IL-1,
their STAT1-deficient counterparts failed to synthesise detectable levels of this
free radical gas. Inability of STAT1-/- fibroblasts to produce NO was accompanied
by complete absence of mRNA for iNOS and its transcription factor IRF-1, both
readily upregulated in wild-type cells. However, treatment with cytokines
(IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-17) significantly increased IL-6 generation in
STAT1-deficient fibroblasts. These results indicate that STAT1 activation and
subsequent IRF-1 transcription are required for induction of iNOS, but not IL-6
in murine fibroblasts.

IFN-gamma regulation of class II transactivator promoter IV in macrophages and
microglia: involvement of the suppressors of cytokine signaling-1 protein.

O'Keefe GM(1), Nguyen VT, Ping Tang LL, Benveniste EN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,
AL 35294, USA.

The discovery of the class II transactivator (CIITA) transcription factor, and
its IFN-gamma-activated promoter (promoter IV), have provided new opportunities
to understand the molecular mechanisms of IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC
expression. Here, we investigated the molecular regulation of IFN-gamma-induced
murine CIITA promoter IV activity in microglia/macrophages. In the macrophage
cell line RAW264.7, IFN-gamma inducibility of CIITA promoter IV is dependent on
an IFN-gamma activation sequence (GAS) element and adjacent E-Box, and an IFN
response factor (IRF) element, all within 196 bp of the transcription start site.
In both RAW cells and the microglia cell line EOC20, two IFN-gamma-activated
transcription factors, STAT-1alpha and IRF-1, bind the GAS and IRF elements,
respectively. The E-Box binds upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF-1), a
constitutively expressed transcription factor. Functionally, the GAS, E-Box, and 
IRF elements are each essential for IFN-gamma-induced CIITA promoter IV activity.
The effects of the suppressors of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) protein on
IFN-gamma-induced CIITA and class II MHC expression were examined. Ectopic
expression of SOCS-1 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced activation of CIITA promoter IV
and subsequent class II MHC protein expression. Interestingly, SOCS-1 inhibits
the constitutive expression of STAT-1alpha and its IFN-gamma-induced tyrosine
phosphorylation and binding to the GAS element in CIITA promoter IV. As well,
IFN-gamma-induced expression of IRF-1 and its binding to the IRF element is
inhibited. These results indicate that SOCS-1 may be responsible for attenuating 
IFN-gamma-induced CIITA and class II MHC expression in macrophages.

Interferons and IRF-1 induce expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) genes.

Author information: 
(1)Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Curie Institute,
Paris, France.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common recessive disorder,
characterized by degeneration of motor neurons of the spinal cord. Deletions,
conversions, or mutations of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN) are responsible
for SMA. A highly homologous centromeric copy of the SMN gene (SMNc) remains
intact in SMA patients. However, there is an inverse correlation between the
amount of the SMNc gene product and the clinical severity of the disease. An
understanding of SMN and SMNc gene regulation is, therefore, an important step
towards therapy for SMA.
RESULTS: We identified a candidate Interferon-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE),
overlapping with an Interferon Regulatory Factors binding motif (IRF-E) in the
promoter region of SMN and SMNc genes. Both ISRE and IRF-E motifs are involved in
mediating transcriptional induction of interferon-stimulated gene expression. We,
therefore, investigated whether SMN and SMNc genes were regulated by interferons 
(IFN). Here we show that both IFN-beta and IFN-gamma rapidly induced SMN and SMNc
mRNA and protein expression in various cell lines. The transcription factor IRF-1
bound to the candidate ISRE/IRF-E sequence of SMN and SMNc genes in vitro and
overexpression of IRF-1 induced expression of both genes in transfection assays. 
IRF-1 is, therefore, at least in part responsible for the induction of SMN and
SMNc by IFNs. In primary culture of fibroblasts from SMA patients, IFN-beta and
IFN-gamma induced SMNc gene expression and restored protein defect.

High level class II trans-activator induction does not occur with transient
activation of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway.

Eason DD(1), Blanck G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine,
University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

Gene activation in early development is highly dependent on precise
concentrations of trans-acting factors for the activation of different genes at
differing points in the embryo. Thus, not only is the presence or absence of a
particular trans-activator or repressor relevant in determining gene activation, 
but also the concentration of the regulatory protein must be above or below a
certain threshold for proper gene regulation. Signaling pathways in somatic cells
are thought to represent cascades of on/off switches, mediated most commonly by
phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate a quantitative mechanism for regulating the 
level of a component of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway that in effect represents
the differential sensitivities of STAT1, IFN-regulatory factor-1, and class II
trans-activator (CIITA) to IFN-gamma. Unlike developmental gene regulation, in
which specificity of gene activation is a function of regulatory protein
concentrations, specificity of gene activation in the IFN-gamma signaling pathway
is regulated by the duration of the activation of the primary
IFN-gamma-regulatory protein, STAT1. This result most likely explains previously 
reported data indicating that a minimum amount of IFN-gamma is required for MHC
class II gene activation despite the fact that the level of the
IFN-gamma-inducible factor directly required for MHC class II induction, CIITA,
directly correlates with the level of MHC class II expression. The induction of a
high level of CIITA is dependent on sustained IFN-gamma signaling. The possible
implications of this result for tumorigenesis are discussed.

Transcriptional regulation of the MHC class Ib genes HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G.

Gobin SJ(1), van den Elsen PJ.

(1)Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University
Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. gobin@LUMC.nl

The restricted tissue expression of the MHC class Ib molecules HLA-E, HLA-F, and 
HLA-G has suggested specialized functions and tight transcriptional control of
their genes. Transactivation of classical MHC class I genes is mediated by two
groups of juxtaposed cis-acting elements, which can be viewed as regulatory
modules. The most upstream module consists of the enhancer A and ISRE, and
mediates constitutive and cytokine induced expression, whereas the SXY module is 
important for the constitutive and CIITA-mediated transactivation of MHC class I 
genes. Nucleotide sequence divergence in these regulatory elements in the
promoters of HLA-E, HLA-F, or HLA-G determines their differential responsiveness 
to NF-kappaB, IRF1, and CIITA-mediated induction. HLA-E is not inducible by
NF-kappaB or IRF1, but is responsive to IFN-gamma through an upstream STAT1
binding site. Furthermore, HLA-E is inducible by CIITA through the SXY regulatory
module. HLA-F is inducible by NF-kappaB through the kappaB1 site of enhancer A,
is responsive to IFN-gamma through the ISRE, and is inducible by CIITA. Both
regulatory modules are divergent in HLA-G rendering this gene unresponsive to
NF-kappaB, IRF1, and CIITA-mediated induction. This implies a unique regulation
of HLA-G transcription amongst the MHC class Ib genes.

Reovirus triggers cell type-specific proinflammatory responses dependent on the

Resident cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, including
epithelial and fibroblast cells, are the initial sites of entry for many viral
pathogens. We investigated the role that these cells play in the inflammatory
process in response to infection with reovirus 1/L. In A549 human bronchial or
HT-29 human colonic epithelial cells, interferon (IFN)-beta, regulated on
activation T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-gamma-inducible protein
(IP)-10, and interleukin-8 were upregulated regardless of whether cells were
infected with replication-competent or replication-deficient reovirus 1/L.
However, in CCD-34Lu human lung fibroblast cells, IFN-beta, IP-10, and RANTES
were expressed only after infection with replication-competent reovirus 1/L.
Expression of interleukin-8 in CCD-34Lu fibroblast cells was viral replication
independent. This differential expression of IFN-beta, RANTES, and IP-10 was
shown to be due to the lack of induction of IFN regulatory factor-1 and -2 in
CCD-34Lu fibroblast cells treated with replication-deficient reovirus 1/L. We
have shown that cytokine and/or chemokine expression may not be dependent on
viral replication. Therefore, treatment of viral infections with inhibitors of
replication may not effectively alleviate inflammatory mediators because most
viral infections result in the generation of replication-competent and
replication-deficient virions in vivo.

Persistent activation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks of HIV-1
infection. In this study we analysed the induction of factors involved in
cytokine signal transduction, such as STAT 1 proteins and IRF-1 mRNA, in normal
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to HIV-infected cells, and the 
induction of apoptosis. Western blot analyses and reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results indicate that both cells infected
with a X4 strain and cells infected with a R5 strain are able to increase
intracellular levels of STAT 1alpha and beta proteins as well as IRF-1 mRNA. This
effect was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against interferon-alpha
(IFN-alpha). HIV-1-infected cells dose-dependently induced apoptotic commitment
in normal PBMC, as revealed by DNA fragmentation analysis, but this was not
accompanied by an increase of caspase-3 activity, even if a slight up-regulation 
of IL-1beta-converting enzyme mRNA was detected. Apoptosis induction could be
abrogated mainly by antibodies against tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
and, to a lesser extent, by antibodies against IFN-gamma. All these findings
suggest that uninfected PBMC can undergo activation of signal transduction and
apoptosis after exposure to bystander HIV-infected cells, subsequent to the
induction of cytokines such as IFNs and TNF-alpha.

Modulation of double-stranded RNA-mediated gene induction by interferon in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Author information: 
(1)Program in Biochemistry, Cellular and Developmental Biology, Emory University,
Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.

Endothelial cells respond to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with expression of a
number of important immunomodulatory and inflammatory response genes, including
adhesion molecules, cytokines, and antiviral genes. Considerable differences are 
seen when genes are induced by dsRNA compared with cytokines. Much higher levels 
of mRNA for interleukin-6 (IL-6), 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-OAS),
protein kinase (PKR), and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) result
from incubation with dsRNA than with IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha), or IFN-alpha, whereas the differences in vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin
mRNA expression in response to dsRNA, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha are relatively
minor. IFN-alpha priming enhances responsiveness of some, but not all, genes to
dsRNA but not to IL-1beta, but the optimal time for pretreatment varies
considerably among different dsRNA-responsive genes. Protein translation is
reduced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in response to
incubation with dsRNA, and this decrease is accentuated if cells are primed with 
IFN-alpha. Despite this decrease, IFN-alpha priming causes very high levels of
IL-6 protein expression in response to dsRNA but not in response to IL-1beta or
TNF-alpha. These studies demonstrate that priming with class I IFN can enhance
the response to dsRNA through the heightened expression of genes that contribute 
to both the cellular response to viral infection and the host immunologic
response.

We tested the hypothesis that inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) and
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a trans-acting factor in iNOS
transcriptional activation, are maturation-dependently expressed in
cytokine-stimulated human enterocytes. Caco-2BBe cells, at varying stages of
maturation, were stimulated with IL-1beta and IFN-gamma. Cytokine stimulation of 
3-day-old undifferentiated Caco-2BBe cells induced low levels of NO production,
iNOS and IRF-1 immunoreactivity, iNOS and IRF-1 mRNA expression, and iNOS
activity, whereas 24-day-old mature cells responded with a large and prolonged
activation of iNOS and IRF-1 expression. The basis for this difference was
accounted in part by the relatively greater iNOS transcription rate in 24- vs.
3-day-old cells. Sequential expression of IRF-1 followed by iNOS mRNA occurred in
both 3- and 24-day-old cells. We conclude that enterocyte maturation profoundly
alters the magnitude and duration of human iNOS and IRF-1 expression in response 
to cytokine stimulation. The differences in iNOS mRNA levels between the immature
and mature cells are only partially explained by difference in transcriptional
rates, implying that post-transcriptional regulation may also be influenced by
the state of enterocyte maturation. Induction of IRF-1 expression precedes and
parallels the level of iNOS expression at all stages of maturation. We propose
that IRF-1 may modulate the expression of cytokine-induced iNOS activity in
differentiating enterocytes.

promoter binds IFN-regulatory factor 1 and mediates enhancement of this
nonclassical class I gene by IFN-beta.

Type I interferons display a broad range of immunomodulatory functions.
Interferon beta increases gene expression at the transcriptional level through
binding of factors to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) within
the promoters of interferon-inducible genes, such as HLA class I. Despite
mutation of the class I ISRE sequence within the nonclassical HLA-G class I gene 
promoter, we show that interferon beta enhances both transcription and cell
surface expression of HLA-G in trophoblasts and amniotic and thymic epithelial
cells that selectively express it in vivo. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis of a
putative interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-1 binding site within the HLA-G
promoter show that HLA-G transactivation is mediated through an ISRE sequence 746
base pairs upstream from ATG, which is distinct from the interferon-responsive
element described within proximal classical class I gene promoters.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and supershift analysis further
demonstrate that interferon-responsive transcription factors, including IRF-1,
specifically bind to the HLA-G ISRE. Our results provide evidence that IRF-1
binding to a functional ISRE within the HLA-G promoter mediates interferon
beta-induced expression of the HLA-G gene. These observations are of general
interest considering the implication of HLA-G in mechanisms of immune escape
involved in fetal-maternal tolerance and other immune privilege situations.

Expression of the nitric oxide synthase 2 gene is not essential for early control
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the murine lung.

The interleukin-12 and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) pathway of macrophage
activation plays a pivotal role in controlling tuberculosis. In the murine model,
the generation of supplementary nitric oxide by the induction of the nitric oxide
synthase 2 (NOS2) gene product is considered the principal antimicrobial
mechanism of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages. Using a low-dose aerosol-mediated
infection model in the mouse, we have investigated the role of nitric oxide in
controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the lung. In contrast to the
consequences of a systemic infection, a low dose of bacteria introduced directly 
into the lungs of mice lacking the NOS2 gene is controlled almost as well as in
intact animals. This is in contrast to the rapid progression of disease in mice
lacking IFN-gamma or a key member of the IFN signaling pathway, interferon
regulatory factor 1. Thus while IFN-gamma is pivotal in early control of
bacterial growth in the lung, this control does not completely depend upon the
expression of the NOS2 gene. The absence of inducible nitric oxide in the lung
does, however, result in increased polymorphonuclear cell involvement and
eventual necrosis in the pulmonary granulomas of the infected mice lacking the
NOS2 gene.

Interplay between repressing and activating domains defines the transcriptional
activity of IRF-1.

Kirchhoff S(1), Oumard A, Nourbakhsh M, Levi BZ, Hauser H.

Author information: 
(1)National Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator with weak
activation capacity. By defining the transcriptional activation domain of IRF-1
we identified two activator fragments located between amino acids 185 and 256
functioning in an additive manner. Another fragment of IRF-1, which has no
activator function alone, acts as a strong enhancer element of these activator
sequences. This enhancer element resides between the activator domains and the
C-terminus. In addition, we identified a novel type of inhibitory domain in the
N-terminal 60 amino acids of IRF-1 which strongly inhibits its transcriptional
activity. Because this fragment is conserved in all interferon regulatory
factors, we found similar repression effects in the corresponding fragments in
IRF-2, IRF-3 and interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP/IRF-8).
Interestingly, the corresponding sequence in p48/IRF-9 is divergent, so that it
does not show this inhibitory activity. A five-amino-acid sequence distinguishes 
the p48/IRF-9 N-terminus from the homologous parts in other interferon regulatory
factors containing the repressing function. Replacing the diverged amino acids in
IRF-1 with the corresponding sequence of p48/IRF-9 resulted in a loss of
inhibitory activity within IRF-1. The opposing activities within interferon
regulatory factors may contribute to balanced or tuned regulation of gene
activation, depending on the promoter context.

Mutation screening of interferon regulatory factor 1 gene (IRF-1) as a candidate 
gene for atopy/asthma.

BACKGROUND: IL-4 gene cluster on chromosome 5 contains several candidate genes
for atopy and asthma. Several independent studies have shown evidence for linkage
between the markers flanking IL-4 gene cluster and asthma and/or asthma-related
traits. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is located approximately 300 kb
telomeric to IL-4 and recent study reveals that IRF-1 deficiency results in an
elevated production of Th2-related cytokines and a compensatory decrease in the
expression of native cell- and Th1-related cytokines.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if there are any mutations associated with the
development of atopy and asthma present in the coding exons and 5' flanking
region of the IRF-1 gene.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We have screened the promoter and coding regions of the
IRF-1 gene in atopic asthmatics and controls by SSCP method. We found three novel
nuclear variants (the -300G/T and 4396 A/G polymorphisms and the 6355G > A rare
variant) in the IRF-1 gene. No variants causing amino acid alterations of IRF-1
were detected. The -300G/T polymorphism was in nearly complete linkage
disequilibrium with the 4396 A/G polymorphism. An association between the 4396 A 
> G polymorphism and atopy/asthma was examined by transmission disequilibrium
test in 81 asthmatic families. Either of 4396 A or 4396G alleles was not
significantly preferentially transmitted to atopy- or asthma-affected children.
CONCLUSION: The IRF-1 gene is less likely to play a substantial role in the
development of atopy and asthma in the Japanese population.

Muramyl dipeptide potentiates cytokine-induced activation of inducible nitric
oxide synthase in rat astrocytes.

University of Belgrade, 11000, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

We investigated the influence of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a cell wall component
of Gram-positive bacteria, on cytokine-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in
rat primary astrocytes. MDP alone did not induce NO release in astrocyte
cultures. However, MDP increased astrocyte NO production and subsequent nitrite
accumulation triggered by IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma-activated expression of mRNA for
inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and iNOS transcription factor interferon regulatory 
factor-1 (IRF-1) was markedly enhanced in astrocytes treated with MDP. The
potentiating effect of MDP on IFN-gamma-induced NO production in astrocytes was
completely blocked with protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor genistein or
mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, protein
kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C did not affect ability of MDP to augment
IFN-gamma-triggered astrocyte NO synthesis. These results suggest that MDP
synergizes with IFN-gamma in the induction of iNOS gene in astrocytes through
mechanisms involving PTK and MAPK, but not PKC activation. Finally, MDP also
augmented NO production and iNOS mRNA expression in astrocytes treated with
IL-1beta.

Loss of interferon-gamma inducibility of TAP1 and LMP2 in a renal cell carcinoma 
cell line.

Dovhey SE(1), Ghosh NS, Wright KL.

Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA.

The inadequate ability of cancer cells to present antigen on the cell surface via
MHC class I molecules is one mechanism by which tumor cells evade
antitumor-associated antigen immunity. In many cases, such as in renal cell
carcinoma (RCC), the lack of MHC class I antigen presentation can be attributed
to the down-regulation of genes needed for antigen processing, such as the
transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP)1 and TAP2, and the
proteasomal components low molecular weight proteins (LMP)2 and LMP7. The TAP1
and LMP2 genes are transcribed from a shared bidirectional promoter containing an
IFN response factor element that confers IFN-gamma inducibility. Here, we
investigate the differential responsiveness to IFN-gamma of RCC cell lines,
Caki-1 and Caki-2, which have been reported to have abnormally low expressions of
TAP1 and LMP2. We now demonstrate that the Caki-2 cell line is defective in the
IFN-gamma signaling pathway. The effects of IFN-gamma on TAP1 and LMP2 expression
revealed a loss of up-regulation in Caki-2 cells, but not in Caki-1 cells. In
vivo DNA footprinting shows a specific loss of occupancy at the IFN response
factor element site in Caki-2 cells, whereas Caki-1 cells show full promoter
occupancy. Furthermore, in vitro DNA-binding studies indicated that Caki-2 cells 
do not have IFN-regulatory factor 1- or signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (Stat1)-binding activity after IFN-gamma stimulation. Examination
of Stat1, Jak1, and Jak2 proteins demonstrated that the proteins were expressed, 
however, not phosphorylated, upon IFN-gamma treatment in Caki-2 cells. Also, this
cell line expressed both IFN-gamma receptor chains. IFN-gamma inducibility could 
not be rescued by introduction of normal Jak1 and/or Jak2 proteins. However,
overexpression of Jak1 did increase TAP1 and LMP2 expression independent of
IFN-gamma, indicating that the Stat1 and IFN-regulatory factor 1 proteins present
in Caki-2 can be activated. These findings suggest that the loss of TAP1 and LMP2
induction is a defect in the earliest steps of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway
resulting in the inability of Caki-2 cells to up-regulate the MHC class I
antigen-processing pathway. Because immunotherapy may be one of the most
promising approaches for treating RCC, understanding the mechanisms by which
these tumors circumvent cytokine signaling, thereby evading
antitumor-specific-antigen immunity, would greatly aid the efficacy of such
therapy.

Over-expression of nucleophosmin/B23 decreases the susceptibility of human
leukemia HL-60 cells to retinoic acid-induced differentiation and apoptosis.

Hsu CY(1), Yung BY.

Republic of China.

Stable clones of HL-60 cells in which nucleophosmin/B23 was over-expressed were
established. Less percentages (4-20%) of nucleophosmin/B23 over-expressed
(pCR3-B23) cells exhibited the morphological characteristic of apoptosis as
compared with control vector-transfected (pCR3) cells (6-53%) during the 10
microM RA treatment for 1-4 days. In flow cytometry analysis, a block in the G1
phase was noted in all the pCR3-B23 and pCR3 cells after 2 days of 10 microM RA
treatment and continued to be observed at all times measured up to 6 days.
Smaller peaks of apoptotic cells with less than G1 DNA content were observed in
pCR3-B23 as compared with pCR3 cells after 4-6 days of 10 microM RA treatment. As
measured by expressions of differentiation markers and the functional assessment 
of the ability to reduce nitroblue-tetrazolium, our results further showed that
over-expression of nucleophosmin/B23 decreased the response of the cells to
RA-induced differentiation. Less cleavage of PARP and in vitro caspase-3 activity
were observed in PCR3-B23 cells as compared with pCR3 cells treated with 10
microM RA for 3-4 days. IRF-1 was induced after 6 hr of 10 microM RA treatment in
the pCR3-B23 and pCR3 cells. Significantly more nucleophosmin/B23 was
co-immunoprecipitated with IRF-1 from pCR3-B23 cells than from pCR3 cells during 
RA treatment (10 microM; 24 hr, 96 hr). The IRF-1 transcriptional activity was
found to be attenuated in pCR3-B23 cells as compared with pCR3 cells during the
treatment of cells with RA. Nucleophosmin/B23, through interacting with IRF-1,
plays an important role in the control of the susceptibility of cells to
RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis.

Retinoic acid and host-pathogen interactions: effects on inducible nitric oxide
synthase in vivo.

Vitamin A and its metabolite retinoic acid modulate the host response to
pathogens through poorly characterized mechanisms. In vitro studies have
suggested that retinoic acid decreases inducible NO synthase (NOS2, or iNOS)
expression, a component of innate immunity, in several cell types stimulated with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokines. This study investigated the effect of
retinoic acid on LPS-stimulated NOS2 expression in vivo. Wistar-Kyoto rats
received all-trans retinoic acid (RA, 10 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally
daily for 5 days followed by LPS (4 mg/kg) or saline intraperitoneally and were
killed 6 h later. NOS2 activation was estimated by mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein
(Western-blot) expression and plasma nitrate/nitrite accumulation. In sharp
contrast to previous in vitro study reports, RA significantly enhanced NOS2 mRNA,
protein expression, and plasma nitrate/nitrite concentration in LPS-injected rats
but not in saline-injected rats. This was associated with increased expression of
interleukin-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IFN regulatory factor-1 mRNAs in
several organs and increased IFN-gamma plasma concentration. RA significantly
increased mortality in LPS-injected rats. The NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (50
mg/kg before LPS injection) significantly attenuated the RA-mediated increase in 
mortality. These results demonstrate for the first time that RA supplementation
in vivo enhances activation of the LPS-triggered NOS2 pathway.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha induces a metalloprotease-disintegrin, ADAM8 (CD
156): implications for neuron-glia interactions during neurodegeneration.

Author information:

Bielefeld, Germany.

ADAM proteases, defined by extracellular disintegrin and metalloprotease domains,
are involved in protein processing and cell-cell interactions. Using wobbler (WR)
mutant mice, we investigated the role of ADAMs in neurodegeneration and reactive 
glia activation in the CNS. We found that ADAM8 (CD 156), a suspected leukocyte
adhesion molecule, is expressed in the CNS and highly induced in affected CNS
areas of WR mice, in brainstem and spinal cord. ADAM8 mRNA and protein are found 
at low levels throughout the normal mouse CNS, in neurons and oligodendrocytes.
In the WR CNS regions in which neurodegeneration occurs, ADAM8 is induced in
neurons, reactive astrocytes, and activated microglia. Similarly, the
proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is upregulated
and shows the same cellular distribution. In primary astrocytes from wild-type
and WR mice, in primary cerebellar neurons, and in mouse motoneuron-like NSC19
cells, ADAM8 expression was induced up to 15-fold by mouse TNF-alpha, in a
dose-dependent manner. In both cell types, ADAM8 was also induced by human
TNF-alpha, indicating that TNF receptor type I (p55) is involved. Induction of
ADAM8 mRNA was suppressed by treatment with an interferon-regulating factor 1
(IRF-1) antisense oligonucleotide. We conclude that IRF-1-mediated induction of
ADAM8 by TNF-alpha is a signaling pathway relevant for neurodegenerative
disorders with glia activation, proposing a role for ADAM8 in cell adhesion
during neurodegeneration.

Phorbol ester synergistically increases interferon regulatory factor-1 and
inducible nitric oxide synthase induction in interferon-gamma-treated RAW 264.7
cells.

The roles of PKC in iNOS induction by IFN-gamma have been shown in some cell
types. The effect of a PKC activator, phorbol ester, in iNOS induction is thought
to be due to multiple mechanisms, and it is necessary to examine the involvement 
of phorbol ester on IFN-gamma-induced iNOS in detail. In the present study, we
investigated the mechanisms of phorbol ester on IFN-gamma-induced iNOS in RAW
264.7 cells. PMA synergistically increased iNOS activity, protein and mRNA levels
in IFN-gamma-treated RAW 264.7 cells. PMA together with IFN-gamma increased iNOS 
mRNA without affecting the iNOS mRNA degradation, suggesting that the synergistic
effect of PMA on IFN-gamma-induced iNOS mRNA production may depend on the
elevation of the transcription rate rather than a prolongation of mRNA stability.
The DNA binding proteins that are involved in the regulation of iNOS expression
are mainly NF-kappa B and IRF-1. IRF-1 transcriptionally regulates many
IFN-inducible genes such as iNOS whose promoter contains an IRF-1 binding site.
PMA might modulate iNOS induction as a cosignal with IFN-gamma in RAW 264.7 cells
because the synergistic effect of PMA was mediated through IRF-1, rather than
NF-kappa B. Ro 31-8220, a PKC inhibitor, decreased iNOS activity, protein, mRNA
levels and IRF-1 activity, indicating that the effect of PMA on iNOS induction
might occur via the PKC pathway. It is evidence that PKC plays an important role 
in IRF-1 activation and that phorbol ester has a synergistic effect on iNOS
induction through IRF-1 activation in IFN-gamma-treated RAW 264.7 cells. The
synergistic effect of PMA on IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1 binding activity was
observed in macrophage cell line J774 cells as well as RAW 264.7 cells, but not
in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages.

Impaired IFN-gamma production in IFN regulatory factor-1 knockout mice during

Mice with a targeted mutation in the gene that encodes the transcription factor
IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were used to assess the contribution of IRF-1 to 
IL-12-dependent and IL-12-independent pathways of IFN-gamma production. In
response to LPS, IRF. 1-/- mice produced less IL-12 p40, IL-12 p35, and IFN-gamma
mRNA in the liver than IRF-1+/+ mice. While pulmonary IFN-gamma mRNA levels were 
also mitigated in IRF-1-/- mice, pulmonary IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p35 mRNA were not 
dysregulated. Circulating IL-12 p70 and IFN-gamma levels were profoundly
attenuated in LPS-challenged IRF-1-/- mice. Further analysis revealed a major
deficiency in hepatic IL-12Rbeta1 and IL-12Rbeta2 mRNA expression as well as
pulmonary IL-12Rbeta1 mRNA expression in LPS-challenged IRF-1-/- mice. In vitro, 
IFN-gamma up-regulated IL-12Rbeta1 mRNA in macrophages from IRF-1+/+, but not
IRF-1-/-, mice. IFN-gamma-induced IL-12Rbeta2 mRNA expression was also diminished
in macrophages from IRF-1-/- mice. In contrast to IRF-1+/+ mice, administration
of exogenous IL-12 to IRF-1-/- mice resulted in reduced serum IFN-gamma and
hepatic and pulmonary IFN-gamma mRNA, demonstrating that loss of IL-12R results
in diminished IL-12 responsiveness. While LPS-challenged IRF-1-/- mice also had
reduced IL-15 mRNA levels, serum IL-18 responses were intact. Finally, induction 
of IRF-1 mRNA by LPS in livers of IFN-gamma knockout mice were markedly
attenuated, suggesting a feedback amplification loop. These studies indicate that
IRF-1 deficiency disrupts both IL-12-dependent and -independent pathways of
IFN-gamma production and that IRF-1 is a critical transcription factor involved
in the regulation of not only IL-12, but also IL-12R.

The present study investigates the regulatory mechanisms involved in the
cooperation between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha to promote transcription from IFN
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). A transient transfection analysis revealed that the 
region between -218 and -144, where +1 is the transcription start site, as well
as previously reported downstream elements, ppkappaB and IFN-gamma activation
site/kappaB, were required for the optimal response to the two cytokines. A
subsequent DNase I footprint analysis showed that the region between -171 and
-144 was inducibly protected with stimulation by TNF-alpha, and this protection
was significantly enhanced with the combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In an
EMSA with the protected region as a probe, a TNF-alpha-inducible complex (C1) and
an IFN-gamma-inducible complex (C2), but no synergy-specific DNA-protein
complexes, were recognized. The C1 complex consisted of a pre-existing factor
(p65/p50), whereas the C2 complex consisted of a newly synthesized IRF-1-related 
factor. A methylation interference assay revealed the critical G residues (from
-167 to -151) for the DNA-protein complex formation specific to the cytokine
response, and within this region the novel kappaB sequence, the promoter distal
kappaB (pdkappaB) element (5'-GGGGAAG TAC-3'), was identified. Because the base
substitutions over the pdkappaB region (from -171 to -144) affected not only the 
TNF-alpha-response but also that of IFN-gamma, this region might contribute to
the cooperative action of the NF-kappaB subunits with the IRF-1-related factor.
Finally, we demonstrated that none of the cis-acting elements, ppkappaB,
pdkappaB, or IFN-gamma activation site/kappaB, is dispensable for the optimal
synergism in response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.

Phosphorylation-deficient Stat1 inhibits retinoic acid-induced differentiation
and cell cycle arrest in U-937 monoblasts.

Laboratory, Uppsala University, SE-75185, Uppsala, Sweden.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent inducer of terminal differentiation of
immature leukemic cell lines in vitro and of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
cells in vivo. Recent reports have shown that ATRA induces the expression of
several interferon-regulated genes, including signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (Stat)1. To investigate the role of Stat1 activation in ATRA
signaling, sublines were established for the human monoblastic cell line U-937
constitutively expressing wild-type or phosphorylation-defective Stat1, mutated
in the conserved tyrosine 701 required for dimerization and nuclear
translocation. Results showed that ATRA induction leads to activation of Stat1 by
the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 and subsequent nuclear translocation.
Consistent with a functional importance of this activation, ectopic expression of
Stat1(Y701F) suppressed ATRA-induced morphologic differentiation and expression
of the monocytic surface markers CD11c and the granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor receptor. Moreover, ATRA-induced growth arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of
the cell cycle was inhibited by phosphorylation-deficient Stat1. Taken together, 
these results indicate that Stat1 is a key mediator of ATRA-induced cell cycle
arrest and differentiation of U-937 cells. (Blood. 2000;96:2870-2878)

Prolactin activates interferon regulatory factor-1 expression in normal
lympho-hemopoietic cells.

It has been proposed that prolactin (PRL) is a lympho-hemopoietic growth and
differentiation factor. We show here by Western blotting that PRL-receptors
(PRL-R) are expressed in normal rat bone marrow and spleen cells. We also show
that PRL stimulates the phosphorylation of the PRL-R-associated Janus tyrosine
kinase (JAK)-2 in rat bone marrow and spleen cells. This leads to the activation 
and subsequent binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)
5b to an interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gamma activation sequence (GAS)
as visualized by electromobility shift assay. As shown after reverse
transcription of mRNA by polymerase chain reaction, PRL, at physiological
concentrations (0.01 microg/ml), stimulates the expression of the IRF-1 gene in
these normal cells. PRL could thus affect several aspects of the immune response.

Chemokines regulate leukocyte traffic and extravasation into the site of
inflammation. Here we show that influenza A- or Sendai virus-infected human
macrophages produce MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-3alpha,
IP-10, and IL-8, whereas no upregulation of MIP-3beta, eotaxin, or MDC production
was detected. Influenza A virus was a better inducer of MCP-1 and MCP-3
production than Sendai virus, whereas MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, MIP-3alpha, 
and IL-8 were induced preferentially by Sendai virus. Infection in the presence
of protein synthesis inhibitor indicated that ongoing protein synthesis was
required for influenza A virus-induced expression of MCP-1, MCP-3, and IP-10
genes, whereas Sendai virus-induced chemokine mRNA expression took place in the
absence of de novo protein synthesis. Neutralization of virus-induced
IFN-alpha/beta resulted in downregulation of virus-induced IP-10, MCP-1, and
MCP-3 mRNA expression. IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma were found to directly enhance
MCP-1, MCP-3, and IP-10 mRNA expression. Both influenza A and Sendai viruses
similarly activated transcription factor NF-kappaB. In contrast to NF-kappaB,
IRFs and STATs, the other transcription factors involved in the regulation of
chemokine gene expression, were differentially activated by these viruses.
Influenza A virus more efficiently activated ISGF3 complex formation and Stat1
DNA-binding compared to Sendai virus, which in turn was a more potent activator
of IRF-1. Our results show that during viral infections macrophages predominantly
produce monocyte and Th1 cell attracting chemokines. Furthermore, virus-induced
IFN-alpha/beta enhanced chemokine gene expression in macrophages emphasizing the 
role of IFN-alpha/beta in the development of Th1 immune responses.

Multifactorial protective mechanisms to limit viral replication in the lung of
mice during primary murine cytomegalovirus infection.

Fernandez JA(1), Rodrigues EG, Tsuji M.

of Medicine, New York 10010, USA.

In this article, we investigated the protective host immune mechanisms against
acute murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. For this purpose, we used various 
knockout mice lacking molecules, which include interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma),
interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma-R), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and perforin. We also used mutant mice
lacking Fas molecule. When we infected these mice with MCMV and determined the
viral titers in their lungs at different time points, we found that IFN-gamma,
IFN-gamma-R, IRF-1, iNOS, and perforin-deficient mice developed significantly
higher titers of infectious MCMV in the lung, compared to those observed in their
respective wild-type controls. In the lungs of Fas-mutant mice, viral titers were
similar to those obtained in wild-type mice.

Inflammation influences vascular remodeling through AT2 receptor expression and
signaling.

The AT(2) receptor, which exerts growth inhibitory effects in cell culture, is
present scantily in the adult vasculature but is reexpressed after vascular
injury. To examine the in vivo role of this receptor in vascular diseases, we
developed a mouse model of vascular remodeling and compared the responses in
wild-type (Agtr2(+)) and AT(2) receptor knockout (Agtr2(-)) mice. Polyethylene
cuff placement on the femoral artery led to the vascular expression of cytokines,
the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), and both the
AT(1) and AT(2) receptors. Although the expressions of IRF-1 and AT(1) receptor
were induced to comparable levels in both the Agtr2(+) and Agtr2(-) mice, the
neointimal lesion size and the smooth muscle cell proliferation were twice
greater in the Agtr2(-) than in the Agtr2(+) mouse. Correlated with this
difference, AT(2) receptor expression was induced predominantly in the smooth
muscle cells of Agtr2(+) mouse. These results demonstrate that the AT(2) receptor
plays an important role in nonocclusive inflammatory injury by mediating the
effects of inflammation on vascular smooth muscle growth inhibition.

Interleukin-4/STAT6 represses STAT1 and NF-kappa B-dependent transcription
through distinct mechanisms.

STAT6 mediates interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent positive and negative regulation of
inflammatory gene expression. In the present report we examined the molecular
mechanisms involved in IL-4-induced repression of reporter gene transcription
driven by STAT1 and/or NF-kappaB. Transient expression of STAT6 in a
STAT6-deficient cell line (HEK 293) conferred sensitivity to IL-4 for
STAT6-dependent transcription and for repression of interferon-gamma
(IFNgamma)/STAT1- and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)/NF-kappaB-driven 
reporter gene expression. In cells transfected with a deletion mutant of STAT6
lacking its transactivating domain, IL-4 could not mediate either positive or
negative control of reporter gene expression. Overexpression of CREB-binding
protein dramatically enhanced IL-4/STAT6-stimulated transcription and overcame
IL-4-mediated repression of TNFalpha/NF-kappaB-dependent but not
IFNgamma/STAT1-dependent transcription. A single amino acid change in the
DNA-binding domain of STAT6 (H415A) selectively reduced the affinity of STAT6 for
IL-4-responsive STAT sequence motifs (N4) without affecting the affinity for
IFNgamma-responsive (GAS) sequences (N3) and, accordingly, eliminated
transcription from an IL-4-responsive promoter. Interestingly, this mutation
eliminated IL-4-mediated suppression of reporter gene transcription stimulated by
TNFalpha/NF-kappaB but retained nearly full capacity to suppress
IFNgamma/STAT1-stimulated transcription. Taken together these results demonstrate
that STAT6 mediates suppression of STAT1 and NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by
distinct mechanisms. Both processes are dependent upon the STAT6 transactivation 
domain and may involve sequestration of necessary but different transcriptional
coactivator proteins. These two suppressive mechanisms are controlled
differentially by the nature of the STAT6 DNA-binding site (i.e. N3 versus N4).

Synergistic induction of the Tap-1 gene by IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide in
macrophages is regulated by STAT1.

Cramer LA(1), Nelson SL, Klemsz MJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of
Medicine, and Walther Cancer Institute, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.

Proper regulation of the Tap-1 gene is critical for the initiation and
continuation of a cellular immune response. Analysis of the Tap-1/low molecular
mass polypeptide 2 bidirectional promoter showed that the IFN-gamma activation
site element is critical for the rapid induction of the promoter by IFN-gamma
following transfection into the human macrophage cell line THP-1. Furthermore,
activation of STAT1 binding to this site was important for the synergistic
response seen following the stimulation with both IFN-gamma and LPS. Mutation of 
an IFN-stimulated regulatory element that binds IFN regulatory factor 1 appeared 
to enhance the response to IFN-gamma and LPS. These data show that STAT1 is
necessary for the activation of Tap-1 gene expression in APCs and initiation of
cellular immune responses. Furthermore, our data suggest that bacterial products 
such as LPS may enhance cellular immune responses through augmenting the ability 
of STAT1 to regulate IFN-gamma-inducible genes.

Inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced janus kinase-1-STAT1 activation in macrophages by
vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide.

Delgado M(1), Ganea D.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.

The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the pituitary adenylate
cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), two immunomodulatory neuropeptides that
affect both innate and acquired immunity, down-regulate IL-12 p40 and inducible
NO synthase expression in LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages. We showed
previously that VIP/PACAP inhibit NF-kappaB nuclear translocation through the
stabilization of IkappaB and reduce IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to
the regulatory elements found in the IL-12 p40 and inducible NO synthase
promoters. In this paper we studied the molecular mechanisms involved in the
VIP/PACAP regulation of IRF-1 transactivating activity. Our studies indicate that
the inhibition in IRF-1 binding correlates with a reduction in IRF-1 protein and 
mRNA in IFN-gamma-treated Raw 264.7 macrophages. In agreement with the described 
Janus kinase (Jak)1/Jak2/STAT1/IRF-1 activation pathway, VIP/PACAP inhibit
Jak1/Jak2, STAT1 phosphorylation, and the binding of STAT1 to the GAS sequence
motif in the IRF-1 promoter. The effects of VIP/PACAP are mediated through the
specific VIP/PACAP receptor-1 and the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) transduction
pathway, but not through the induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 or
suppressor of cytokine signaling-3. Because IFN-gamma is a major stimulator of
innate immune responses in vivo, the down-regulation of IFN-gamma-induced gene
expression by VIP and PACAP could represent a significant element in the
regulation of the inflammatory response by endogenous neuropeptides.

Differential interleukin-10 expression in interferon regulatory factor-1
deficient mice during Plasmodium berghei blood-stage infection.

University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260, Singapore.

Mice deficient of functional interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1-/-) by
targeted gene disruption infected with a lethal murine malaria strain, Plasmodium
berghei ANKA survived longer than its wild-type littermates despite the inability
to induce appreciable amounts of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and nitric oxide.
In addition, infected IRF-1-/- mice displayed less organ injury with reduced
necrosis and inflammation. Both wild-type and IRF-1-/- mice treated with
exogenous interleukin-12 (IL-12) suffered extensive organ damage with
corresponding up regulation of IFN-gamma, suggesting the pathogenic potential of 
IL-12 and IFN-gamma. IL-10 is a cytokine produced by CD4+ T lymphocytes belonging
to the Th2 subset. Expression of IL-10 in the wild-type mice correlated with the 
severity of the infection, with higher mRNA expression towards the later stage of
infection. In contrast to the wild-type mice, IL-10 levels in the IRF-1-/- mice
were induced early in the infection and decreased gradually as the infection
progressed. Both untreated and IL-12 treated wild-type mice appeared to follow a 
Th1-like immune response early in the infection and a Th2-like immune response
later in the infection. However, the IRF-1-/- mice were able to launch an altered
immune response with a Th2-like immune response early in the infection. These
findings suggest that IL-10 expression in the IRF-1-/- mice during the early
stage of P. berghei ANKA infection could play an important role in suppressing
pathogenic effects of a cell mediated immune response and promoting protective
immunity against the parasite.

Specific ablation of antiviral gene expression in macrophages by
antibody-dependent enhancement of Ross River virus infection.

Ross River virus (RRV) is an indigenous Australian arthropod-borne alphavirus
responsible for epidemic polyarthritis (EPA), myalgia, and lethargy in humans.
Macrophages and monocytes have been associated with human RRV disease, and
previous studies have shown that RRV is capable of infecting macrophages via both
a natural virus receptor and by Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE). Similar to other viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus
and dengue virus, ADE infection results in dramatic RRV growth increases for in
vitro macrophage cultures. This study demonstrates that RRV could resist
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced antiviral activity in macrophage cultures when
infection was via the ADE pathway. Investigation of this infection pathway found 
that RRV was able to suppress the transcription and translation of key antiviral 
genes (tumor necrosis factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase) in
LPS-stimulated macrophages by disrupting the transcription into mRNA of the genes
coding for the associated transcription factors IRF-1 and NF-kappaB. The
transcription of non-antiviral control genes was not perturbed by RRV-ADE
infection, and de novo protein synthesis also was not significantly affected in
RRV-ADE infected cells. The ADE pathway of infection allowed RRV to specifically 
target antiviral genes in macrophages, resulting in unrestricted virus
replication. As ADE has been observed for several virus families and associated
with disease and adverse vaccination outcomes, these findings may have broad
relevance to viral disease formation and antiviral vaccination strategies.

Retinoic acid and polyriboinosinic acid act synergistically to enhance the
antibody response to tetanus toxoid during vitamin A deficiency: possible
involvement of interleukin-2 receptor-beta, signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1, and interferon regulatory factor-1.

Pennsylvania, USA.

Antibody responses to T cell-dependent antigens are reduced during vitamin A (VA)
deficiency and restored by retinoids. To test whether retinoic acid (RA) and
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC), an inducer of interferons, can increase
specific antibody production, VA-deficient rats were treated with all-trans-RA,
PIC, or both at the time of primary immunization with tetanus toxoid.
VA-deficient rats produced low primary and secondary anti-tetanus IgG responses
(P<.001 vs. VA-sufficient controls). Both responses were increased
synergistically by RA plus PIC (P<.0001). In VA-deficient spleens, mRNAs were low
for interleukin (IL)-2 receptor-beta, interferon regulatory factor-1, and signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 1. Each, however, was induced by RA
plus PIC (P<.0001 vs. controls). Conversely, IL-12 and IL-10 mRNAs were elevated 
in VA deficiency and were induced by PIC and suppressed by RA. Thus, RA plus PIC 
appears to be a promising combination for stimulating antigen-specific immunity. 
Several molecular factors identified here may partially account for the observed 
enhancement.

The interferon-alpha regulation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and
IRF-2 has therapeutic implications in carcinoid tumors.

Zhou Y(1), Wang S, Gobl A, Oberg K.

Author information: 
(1)Endocrine Oncology Unit of Internal Medicine, Uppsala University Hospital,
Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) has been demonstrated to
possess antiproliferative and tumor suppressor functions, on the contrary. IRF-2 
has been suggested to induce oncogenetic effect in some cell lines, but not
evaluated in tumor patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 35 carcinoid tumor patients, expressions of IRF-1 and
IRF-2 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and their values were analyzed
with clinical treatment response. In carcinoid tumor cell line, Bonl, effects of 
IFN-alpha on the expression of both IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNAs and proteins were
determined by Northern blot, RNase protection assays and Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: IFN-alpha up-regulated the expression of IRF-1 and IRF-2 both in vivo
and in vitro. In carcinoid tumors, IFN-alpha treatment led to a significant
increase in the expression of IRF-1 (P < 0.001) and IRF-2 (P < 0.001). Moreover, 
the IRFs induction was correlated with the clinical response of IFN-alpha
treatment, although their baseline values were not predictive. In addition,
expressions of IRF-1 and IRF-2 were significantly correlated with the p68 kinase 
expression (P = 0.032 and P = 0.0176, respectively) and the expression of IRF-1
protein was positively correlated with that of IRF-2 (r = 0.671, P = 0.0001)
tested in the same specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF-1 as well as IRF-2 have therapeutic implications in carcinoid
tumors during treatment with interferon-alpha and IRFs induction might be used as
indicators of response to treatment with interferon-alpha.

Mumps virus can suppress the effective augmentation of HPC-induced apoptosis by
IFN-gamma through disruption of IFN signaling in U937 cells.

Cells of the human promonocytic cell line U937 were found to be sensitive to
hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC), which is a potential anticancer drug. Induction of
apoptosis was found in U937 cells after treatment with HPC for 24 to 48 hr. The
apoptosis in U937 cells exposed to HPC was increased significantly in the
presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The augmentation of HPC-induced
apoptosis by IFN-gamma is repressed in cells (U937-MP) persistently infected with
mumps virus. A persistently infected cell line, U937-MP, showed poor induction of
signal transducers and activators of transcription-1alpha (STAT-alpha), STAT-2,
p48 and IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which are closely correlated with
interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma signaling pathways. Expression of MHC 
class-I or class-II was augmented by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in U937 cells, but
not in persistently infected cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the IFN-gamma
signaling pathway plays an important role in the augmentation of HPC-induced
apoptosis. Mumps virus can suppress the IFN-gamma signaling pathway and
subsequent development of apoptosis.

University of Tokyo, Japan.

We study a family of transcription factors, the interferon regulatory factors
(IRFs), as originally identified in the context of the regulation of type-I
interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) system. Most notably, studies on IRF-1 have revealed 
its remarkable functional diversity in the regulation of cellular responses of
host defense, including oncogenesis. The IRF family has now expanded to nine
members, and gene disruption studies have revealed critical involvement of some
of the members in the regulation of cell growth and oncogenesis. In this review, 
we summarize our current knowledge on the involvement of members of the IRF
family members, in particular, IRF-1, in oncogenesis.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that plays a major role in
lung function deterioration in cystic fibrosis patients. To identify critical
host responses during infection, we have used high-density DNA microarrays,
consisting of 1,506 human cDNA clones, to monitor gene expression in the A549
lung pneumocyte cell line during exposure to P. aeruginosa. We have identified
host genes that are differentially expressed upon infection, several of which
require interaction with P. aeruginosa and the expression of the major subunit of
type IV pili, PilA. Differential expression of genes involved in various cellular
functions was identified, and we selected the gene encoding the transcription
factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) for further analysis. The levels of
the IRF-1 transcript increased 3- to 4-fold in A549 cells after adherence by P.
aeruginosa. A similar increase of IRF-1 mRNA was observed in A549 cells exposed
to wild-type P. aeruginosa when compared to an isogenic, nonpiliated strain.
However, this difference was abolished when serum was present during the
incubation of bacteria. Exposure of A549 cells to purified P. aeruginosa
lipopolysaccharide did not result in a significant increase in IRF-1 mRNA.
Although the P. aeruginosa-induced increased IRF-1 expression depends on the
presence of bacterial adhesin, our findings do not preclude the possibility that 
other bacterial products are responsible for IRF-1 activation, which is enhanced 
by bacterial adherence to cells. These data show that microarray technology can
be an important tool for studying the complex interplay between bacterial
pathogens and host.

In vivo alterations of IFN regulatory factor-1 and PIAS1 protein levels in cystic
fibrosis epithelium.

Inducible nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) expression has been shown to be reduced 
in cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelial cells. Reduced NOS2 expression is unexpected, 
given the inflammatory nature of CF airway disease, and is an indication that
cell-signaling mechanisms necessary for proper NOS2 regulation are probably
altered in CF epithelium. Therefore, we examined the expression levels of
regulatory factors necessary for NOS2 expression in CF epithelium and showed that
IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is necessary for full NOS2 expression. Mice
lacking IRF-1 expression have diminished epithelial NOS2 expression, as well as
reduced NO-dependent chloride transport across the nasal epithelia. Furthermore, 
IRF-1 protein expression is reduced in nasal and intestinal epithelial cells from
CF mice, suggesting a possible mechanism for the CF-related reduction of
epithelial NOS2 expression. Active signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1 (Stat1) is necessary for both NOS2 and IRF-1 expression. We found
that protein levels of Stat1 were increased in CF cells, but that the active
phosphorylated form of Stat1 was bound to the protein inhibitor of activated
Stat1 (PIAS1). We propose that increased levels of PIAS1 diminish certain
cell-signaling pathways, resulting in reduced IRF-1 and NOS2 expression in CF
epithelial cells.

Genetic instability in myelodysplastic syndrome: detection of microsatellite
instability and loss of heterozygosity in bone marrow samples with karyotype
alterations.

Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach, we examined the
prevalence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI)
in relation to chromosomal imbalances in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Two of
26 patients displayed MSI (8%), one of them at five loci. LOH was detected in six
out of 26 cases (23%), predominantly involving markers IRF1 [5q31] and WT1 [11p].
Two patients displayed a corresponding chromosomal deletion by conventional
cytogenetics. Supporting the mutator phenotype hypothesis, a significant
coincidence of LOH, MSI and chromosome abnormalities was observed (P < 0.025).
Moreover, our data suggest that LOH represents an initial rather than a secondary
genetic event in MDS, promoting genetic instability in a subset of patients.

Tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma synergistically activate the
RANTES promoter through nuclear factor kappaB and interferon regulatory factor 1 
(IRF-1) transcription factors.

Inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) synergistically activate expression of the RANTES
(regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) gene, which
plays a crucial role in the chemoattraction of leukocytes during the inflammatory
response. To understand at the molecular level the mechanism by which the two
cytokines activate RANTES gene expression, we determined the requirement of
cis-acting elements in the RANTES promoter and trans-acting factors. The murine
RANTES promoter contained one putative interferon regulatory factor, IRF, and
three putative nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding sites. Specific
destruction of the IRF binding site and one of the three NF-kappaB binding sites 
abolished the inducibility of promoter activity by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha,
respectively. In contrast, mutation of the other two putative NF-kappaB binding
sites did not affect RANTES promoter activity significantly. In addition, the
RANTES promoter was stimulated by co-transfection of plasmids that expressed
either p65, an NF-kappaB family protein, or the IRF-1 transcription factor.
RANTES promoters with mutations in the NF-kappaB or IRF binding sites were not
stimulated by p65 or IRF-1 expression, respectively. In electrophoretic
mobility-shift and immunologic assays, we showed that IRF-1 was induced after
cells were treated with IFN-gamma and that NF-kappaB was activated by TNF-alpha
treatment. These results demonstrate that both NF-kappaB and IRF-1 transcription 
factors mediate the induction of RANTES expression via their cognate cis-acting
elements when cells are stimulated by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.

IFN-beta induces serine phosphorylation of Stat-1 in Ewing's sarcoma cells and
mediates apoptosis via induction of IRF-1 and activation of caspase-7.

Author information: 
(1)INSERM U 365, Institut Curie, Paris, France.

Four human cell lines derived from Ewing's sarcoma, EW-7, EW-1, COH and ORS, were
investigated to establish the effects of human recombinant interferon-alpha2a and
human recombinant interferon-beta on cell proliferation and apoptosis. All four
cell lines were much more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-beta 
than of IFN-alpha. Analysis of the early signals triggered by IFN-alpha and
IFN-beta demonstrated that the two IFNs were similarly effective in inducing
tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jak-1 and Tyk-2 kinases and the transcription
factors Stat-1 and Stat-2. Interestingly, an additional rapid phosphorylation of 
Stat-1 on serine was observed after IFN-beta treatment, with concomitant
activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In these cells, Stat-1 Ser727
phosphorylation in response to IFN-beta was found to be impaired by p38 MAPkinase
inhibitor (SB203580). IFN-beta induced the formation of the Interferon Stimulated
Gene Factor 3 complex more efficiently than IFN-alpha, as well as sustained
induction of IRF-1, which may account for its greater induction of
2'5'oligo(A)synthetase and greater inhibition of cell proliferation. IFN-beta,
but not IFN-alpha, induced apoptosis in wild-type p53 EW-7 and COH cell lines,
but not in the mutated p53 EW-1 or ORS cell lines. The apoptosis induced by
IFN-beta in EW-7 and COH cell lines appeared to be mediated by IRF-1 and involved
the activation of caspase-7. Ectopic expression of IRF-1 induced apoptosis in all
four cell lines which correlated with the activation of caspase-7 and with the
downregulation of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein, as observed for IFN-beta-induced
apoptosis in parental EW-7 and COH cell lines.

Analysis of mRNA levels in cells that express or lack signal transducers and
activators of transcription 1 (Stat1) reveals that Stat1 mediates the
constitutive transcription of many genes. Expression of the low molecular mass
polypeptide 2 (LMP2), which requires Stat1, has been studied in detail. The
overlapping interferon consensus sequence 2/gamma-interferon-activated sequence
(ICS-2/GAS) elements in the LMP2 promoter bind to interferon regulatory factor 1 
(IRF1) and Stat1 and are occupied constitutively in vivo. The point mutant of
Stat1, Y701F, which does not form dimers involving SH2-phosphotyrosine
interactions, binds to the GAS element and supports LMP2 expression.
Unphosphorylated Stat1 binds to IRF1 directly and we conclude that this complex
uses the ICS-2/GAS element to mediate constitutive LMP2 transcription in vivo.
The promoter of the IRF1 gene, which also contains a GAS site but not an adjacent
ICS-2 site, is not activated by Stat1 Y701F. The promoters of other genes whose
constitutive expression requires Stat1 may also utilize complexes of
unphosphorylated Stat1 with IRF1 or other transcription factors.

OBJECTIVE: To explore preliminarily the changes of IRF-1 gene expression in
leukemias.
METHODS: The expression of IRF-1 gene in 24 leukemia patients and 3 leukemic cell
lines were studied with RT-PCR and the silver sequence techniques.
RESULTS: No expression of IRF-1 gene in 3 patients, and significantly decreased
expressions in 5 patients and in HL-60 and HIMeg cell lines were revealed.
CONCLUSION: The mechanism of human leukemogenesis may be partly associated with
no or low-expression of IRF-1 gene.

We identified an interferon regulatory factor motif (IRF-E) upstream of an
NF-kappaB binding site in the interleukin-15 (IL-15) promoter. Since these two
motifs are part of the virus-inducible enhancer region of the beta interferon
promoter, we speculated that there might be similar responses of these two genes 
to stimuli such as viruses. To test this hypothesis, L929 cells were infected
with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which led to the induction of IL-15 mRNA and 
protein expression. Using IL-15 promoter-reporter deletion constructs, a
virus-inducible region, encompassing IRF-E, NF-kappaB, and a 13-nucleotide
sequence flanked by these two motifs, was mapped to the -295-to--243 position
relative to the transcription initiation site. Using cotransfection studies, it
was demonstrated that all three motifs were essential to achieve the maximum
promoter activity induced by IRF-1 and NF-kappaB expression plasmids. The
presence of a virus-inducible region in the IL-15 promoter suggests a role for
IL-15 as a component of host antiviral defense mechanisms.

Interleukin-18 mRNA, but not interleukin-18 receptor mRNA, is constitutively
expressed in islet beta-cells and up-regulated by interferon-gamma.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) mRNA is expressed in islets of NOD mice during the early
stages of insulitis and IL-18 has therefore been implicated as a contributing
factor in immune-mediated beta-cell destruction. However, a recent study failed
to show any effect of human IL-18 on the function of isolated rat islets. Since
species differences have been shown between human and murine IL-18, the aims of
this study were to investigate 1) if species homologous IL-18 alone or following 
IL-12 pre-exposure affected rat islet function, 2) if IL-18 dose-dependently
modulated IL-1 beta or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) + tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha) actions on islet function, and 3) if IL-18 and IL-18 receptor
(IL-18R) were expressed in rat islet beta-cells. Insulin release and nitric oxide
(NO) production from isolated rat islets were measured after incubation with or
without cytokines. RT-PCR was used to quantitate mRNA expression of IL-18 and the
IL-18R signaling chain (IL-18R beta). There were no significant effects of
0.625-10 nM recombinant murine (rm) IL-18 alone on accumulated or
glucose-challenged insulin release or NO production after 24 hours. Fifteen pg/ml
of recombinant human (rh) IL-1 beta as well as 200 U/ml recombinant rat (rr)
IFN-gamma + 250 U/ml rhTNF-alpha significantly increased islet NO production and 
inhibited both accumulated and glucose-challenged islet insulin release. However,
rmIL-18 failed to modulate these effects of IL-1 beta or IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha.
Although IL-12 induces IL-18R expression in Th1 and B lymphocytes, 24-hours
rmIL-12 preincubation neither sensitized islets to effects of 10 nM of rm or
rrIL-18 alone nor primed the islets to IL-1 beta actions on insulin release and
NO production. IL-18R beta mRNA, which was expressed in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC), was not expressed in rat insulinoma (RIN) cells or in
isolated rat islets, even after exposure to IL-1 beta and/or IFN-gamma +
TNF-alpha or IL-12. IL-18 mRNA was constitutively expressed in RIN cells, in
FACS-purified rat beta-cells and in intact rat and mouse islets, and was
up-regulated by IFN-gamma in an interferon regulatory factor-1- IRF-1) and NO -
independent manner. However, IL-18 protein was undetectable in lysates and
supernates of RIN cells by ECL, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. In
conclusion, we show for the first time that IL-18 but not IL-18R is expressed in 
rodent islet beta-cells. The physiological importance and pathological role of
IL-18 originating from islet beta-cells deserve further investigation.

The influence of dosing time on the pharmacological effect (antiviral activity)
of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic
mechanisms, were investigated in ICR male mice under a 12-h light/dark cycle
(lights on from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM). 2'-5'Oligoadenylate synthetase activity in
plasma at 24 h after IFN-alpha (10 MI.U./kg, i.v.) injection, as an index of
antiviral activity, was significantly higher for injections given at 9:00 AM than
for injections given at 9:00 PM (P <.05). The uptake of [(3)H]thymidine by
lymphocytes after 24-h incubation with IFN-alpha, as an index of
lymphocyte-stimulating effect, was significantly higher in cells obtained at 9:00
AM than in the cells obtained at 9:00 PM (P <.01). The number of receptors per
cell and the expression of interferon-stimulated gene factor in lymphocytes after
24-h incubation with IFN-alpha were significantly higher in the cells obtained at
9:00 AM than at 9:00 PM (P <.05). A significant dosing time-dependent difference 
was demonstrated for the pharmacokinetic parameters of IFN-alpha, which showed
higher clearance for injections given at 9:00 PM than for those at 9:00 AM (P
<.05). The metabolism of IFN-alpha was significantly higher in kidney obtained at
9:00 PM than at 9:00 AM (P <.05). These findings support that choosing the most
appropriate time of day for administration of IFN-alpha, associated with the
rhythmicity of IFN-alpha receptor function and IFN-alpha pharmacokinetics, may
increase the antiviral activity in experimental and clinical situations.

Prolonged exposure of mouse macrophages to IFN-beta suppresses transcription of
the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene: altered availability of transcription
factor Stat1alpha.

Center, Kansas City 66160-7184, USA.

Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that prolonged exposure of mouse 
macrophages to IFN-beta interferes with their subsequent ability to become
activated for tumor cell killing. Data reported here show that such inhibition is
due to reduced production of NO, resulting from decreased transcription of the
gene that encodes inducible NO synthase (iNOS; EC 1.14.13.39). The molecular
basis for such suppression was shown to be, at least in part, decreased nuclear
accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1alpha (pStat1alpha), and a
consequent change in the nuclear ratio of pStat1alpha to non-transactivating
pStat1beta. Reduced phosphorylation was observed despite the fact that
time-course studies revealed greater than normal quantities of both Stat1alpha
and Stat1beta proteins in macrophages that had been pre-exposed to IFN-beta. The 
decrease in nuclear pStat1alpha was demonstrated to involve an increase in the
rate of turnover of phosphorylated protein. The homodimeric form of pStat1alpha
is essential for the expression of both the iNOS and IFN-regulatory factor-1
genes (the product of the latter is necessary for full expression of the iNOS
gene). These results have broad implications, because they suggest that limiting 
the availability of homodimeric pStat1alpha is a means by which down-regulation
of genes containing promoter-linked IFN-gamma-activated sites might be achieved.

IFN-gamma and IL-4 differently regulate inducible NO synthase gene expression
through IRF-1 modulation.

NO is a labile radical involved in several immunological, antimicrobial and
inflammatory processes. In macrophages, NO formation is catalyzed by the
cytokine-inducible enzyme inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The importance of IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and of the signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT)-1 for the induction of iNOS gene expression in response to
IFN-gamma has been well defined. Here, we investigated the molecular events
responsible for the inhibition of iNOS gene expression by IL-4 in the murine
macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Unidirectional deletion analysis on iNOS promoter 
demonstrated that an IFN-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), contained in the
-980 to -765 bp region of the iNOS promoter, may be involved in the IL-4-mediated
inhibition of IFN-gamma-inducible iNOS transcription. Accordingly, the
IFN-gamma-induced binding activity of IRF-1 to the ISRE sequence was reduced in
cells pre-treated with IL-4, while the binding activity of STAT-1 to the
STAT-binding element (SBE) within the same region of the iNOS promoter remained
unaffected. Moreover, IL-4 even down-regulated IFN-gamma-inducible expression of 
IRF-1 mRNA. This could be related to a transcriptional mechanism by which IL-4
and IFN-gamma differentially influence the trans-acting activity of the STAT
factors binding to SBE within the IRF-1 promoter. SBE is targeted by
IFN-gamma-inducible STAT-1 and by IL-4-inducible STAT-6. Although STAT-6 has no
trans-acting function on iNOS gene expression, it is able to inhibit the
IFN-gamma-induced expression of IRF-1. Thus, IL-4 may down-regulate
IFN-gamma-inducible iNOS transcription by activation of STAT-6 which in turn
inhibits IRF-1 expression.

NO synthase 2 (NOS2) is induced in airway epithelium by influenza virus
infection. NOS2 induction late in the course of viral infection may occur in
response to IFN-gamma, but early in infection gene expression may be induced by
the viral replicative intermediate dsRNA through the dsRNA-activated protein
kinase (PKR). Since PKR activates signaling pathways important in NOS2 gene
induction, we determined whether PKR is a component in the signal transduction
pathway leading to NOS2 gene expression after viral infection of airway
epithelium. We show that NOS2 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells
occurs in response to influenza A virus or synthetic dsRNA. Furthermore, dsRNA
leads to rapid activation of PKR, followed by activation of signaling components 
including NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor 1. NOS2 expression is markedly
diminished and IFN regulatory factor 1 and NF-kappaB activation are substantially
impaired in PKR null cells. Strikingly, NOS2 induction in response to LPS is
abolished in PKR null cells, confirming a central role for PKR in the general
signaling pathway to NOS2.

IL-12 is a cytokine that links innate and adaptive immunity. Its subunit p40 is
induced in macrophages following IFN-gamma/LPS stimulation. Here we studied the
role for IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), an
IFN-gamma/LPS-inducible transcription factor of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF)
family in IL-12 p40 transcription. Macrophage-like cells established from
ICSBP-/- mice did not induce IL-12 p40 transcripts, nor stimulated IL-12 p40
promoter activity after IFN-gamma/LPS stimulation, although induction of other
inducible genes was normal in these cells. Transfection of ICSBP led to a marked 
induction of both human and mouse IL-12 p40 promoter activities in ICSBP+/+ and
ICSBP-/- cells, even in the absence of IFN-gamma/LPS stimulation. Whereas IRF-1
alone was without effect, synergistic enhancement of promoter activity was
observed following cotransfection of ICSBP and IRF-1. Deletion analysis of the
human promoter indicated that the Ets site, known to be important for activation 
by IFN-gamma/LPS, also plays a role in the ICSBP activation of IL-12 p40. A DNA
affinity binding assay revealed that endogenous ICSBP is recruited to the Ets
site through protein-protein interaction. Last, transfection of ISCBP alone led
to induction of the endogenous IL-12 p40 mRNA in the absence of IFN-gamma and
LPS. Taken together, our results show that ICSBP induced by IFN-gamma/LPS, acts
as a principal activator of IL-12p40 transcription in macrophages.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 regulate interferon

Cyclooxygenases (Cox) are rate-limiting enzymes that initiate the conversion of
arachidonic acid to prostanoids. Cox-2 is the inducible isoform that is
upregulated by proinflammatory agents, initiating many prostanoid-mediated
pathological aspects of inflammation. In this study, we demonstrate that
interferon (IFN)-gamma alone or in synergy with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
interleukin 1alpha induces Cox-2 expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages,
which is paralleled by changes in Cox-2 protein levels and prostaglandin E(2)
(PGE(2)) release. Induction of Cox-2 was abrogated in macrophages that lack IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)-1, consistent with an attenuated hepatic mRNA response in
IRF-1(-/-) mice injected with LPS. Conversely, the absence of IRF-2 in
macrophages resulted in a significant increase in both basal and inducible Cox-2 
gene and protein expression as well as IFN-gamma-stimulated PGE(2) release,
identifying IRF-2 as negative regulator of this promoter. Two IFN stimulation
response elements were identified in the mouse Cox-2 promoter that were highly
conserved in the human Cox-2 gene. Both bind endogenous IRF-1 and IRF-2 and
regulate transcription in an IRF-1/2-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate
conclusively the importance of IFN-gamma as a direct activator and coactivator of
the Cox-2 gene, and the central role of IRF-1/2 family members in this process.

Imiquimod (IQ) has been successfully used in treatment of genital warts. In
clinical settings, patients responded well but wart reduction rates varied. Our
aim was to find a correlation between clinical responses and pretreatment
(constitutive) levels of genes that might be involved in the molecular action of 
IQ. Since IQ is a cytokine inducer, we analyzed levels of expression of genes of 
the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and their inhibitors as well as interferon
response factors (IRFs) in pretreatment biopsy specimens from complete responders
(99 to 100% wart reduction rate) versus incomplete responders (75 to 92% wart
reduction rate) by reverse transcription-PCR. We found that mRNA levels of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and IRF1 were higher in
complete responders than in incomplete responders. Incomplete responders
expressed larger amounts of STAT3, IRF2, and protein inhibitor of activated STAT1
(PIAS1) mRNAs compared to complete responders before IQ treatment. We hypothesize
that high-level expression of STAT1 and IRF1 is advantageous for a better IQ
response. The observed differences in constitutive mRNA levels of these genes may
be the consequence of alterations in cellular differentiation and/or variable
expression of endogenous interferons. Previous in vitro studies showed that
keratinocyte differentiation coordinates the balance between positive and
negative signals along the JAK/STAT pathway by regulating the IRF1:IRF2 and
STAT1:PIAS1 ratios and thus affecting induction of IQ-inducible genes.
Specifically, differentiation supports constitutive expression of STAT1 and IRF1 
mRNAs but not expression of IRF2 and PIAS1. Our data are in good agreement with
studies that showed the importance of STAT1 in cytokine induction and activation 
of interferon-responsive genes by IQ.

A monoclonal anti-peptide antibody (2E11) was raised against the synthetic
peptide 38 (C-L-D-K-S-G-L-P-S-D-R-F-F-A) representing a part of the variable
region of the Vbeta 6.2 T-cell receptor. This mAb (IgG(1), kappa light chain)
bound very specifically to peptide 38 as shown by ELISA but did not recognize the
corresponding native Vbeta 6.2 T-cell receptor on T-cells. For epitope analysis, 
overlapping peptides of 4-10 amino acids in length corresponding to the sequence 
of peptide 38 were synthesized and assayed by SPOT synthesis on cellulose sheets.
The shortest peptide recognized was L-P-S-D-R. The specificity of mAb 2E11 was
examined with 100 different peptides comprising other parts of the different
variable Vbeta domains of the human T-cell receptor that do not include the
epitope region L-P-S-D-R. None of these peptides were recognized. The chemical
synthesis of a peptide with the sequence L-P-S-D-R on Sepharose beads allowed to 
efficiently purify the mAb 2E11 in a single step by affinity chromatography. An
equilibrium binding constant of 4.9x10(6) l/mol was determined for mAb 2E11 by
using rhodamine-green-labelled peptide 38 in fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy. In order to demonstrate that peptide 38 can be used as an
affinity-tag, it was fused to the carboxyl-terminus of interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1). It could be shown that in vitro translated peptide 38 tagged
IRF-1 was immunoprecipitated by the mAb 2E11 and that the fusion protein could be
purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Additionally peptide 38 was fused to
the amino-terminus of the Taq polymerase. This recombinant protein was expressed 
in E. coli and specifically detected in a Dot blot and Western blot using mAb
2E11.

Docosahexaenoic acid decreases IRF-1 mRNA and thus inhibits activation of both
the IRF-E and NFkappa d response elements of the iNOS promoter.

Kielar ML(1), Jeyarajah DR, Penfield JG, Lu CY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas 75235-8856, USA.

BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) may
be cytotoxic during cardiac, hepatic, and renal acute allograft rejection.
Because the incidence of rejection is decreased by fish oils that contain
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), we investigated the effects of DHA on iNOS. Using
nuclear run-on assays and iNOS-promoter constructs, we previously showed that
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits activation of the iNOS gene by murine
macrophages that had been stimulated in vitro by IFNgamma plus
lipopolysaccharide.
METHODS: In our current investigation, our purpose has been to determine how DHA 
inhibits iNOS gene activation in murine macrophages, by using gel retardation and
Northern blotting techniques. We studied the effects of DHA on the formation
nuclear protein complexes that interact with the critical iNOS promoter's
response elements for IRF-1 (IRF-E -923 to -913 bp) and NF-kappaB (NFkappa d -85 
to -75 bp).
RESULTS: We now show that DHA inhibited increases of IRF-1 mRNA abundance in
response to IFNgamma plus lipopolysaccharide. As expected, we found that this
prevented formation of the nuclear protein complex that binds to the IRF-E DNA
response element. We also found that inhibition of IRF-1 inhibited formation of
the nuclear protein complex that binds to the NFkappa d DNA response element.
CONCLUSIONS: DHA decreases the abundance of IRF-1 mRNA in stimulated cells. That,
in turn, results in the decreased nuclear protein binding to the major iNOS
promoter response elements (IRF-E and NF-kappaB). We found that this occurred
because IRF-1 is a component of both the nuclear protein complex that binds to
IRF-E and the nuclear protein complex that binds to NFkappa d.

(1)Department of Molecular Technologies, Bayer Corporation, 800 Dwight Way,
Berkeley, CA 94710, USA.

The effects of transgene delivery by adenoviral vectors were studied by probing a
588 gene, mouse cDNA array with mRNA derived from infected liver. The liver
tissues were obtained from naive mice and mice infected with
replication-deficient adenovirus, adenovirus expressing transforming growth
factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), and adenovirus expressing connective tissue growth
factor (CTGF). Expression of 98 genes was detected in the array analysis. The
increased expression of the transcripts for Stat1, gamma interferon-induced
monokine (MIG) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) clearly demonstrated the
immune response induced by infection with a first generation,
replication-incompetent adenovirus. In vivo expression of TGFbeta1 led to a
down-regulation of genes involved in the immune response. The increased
expression of u-PAR1, laminin receptor and BMP-1 confirms the importance of CTGF 
and TGFbeta1 in angiogenesis, and tissue repair. Expression of the serine
protease inhibitors, Spi 2.4 and Spi 2, is also increased in response to
AdTGFbeta1 and AdCTGF.

Hospital, Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK.

BACKGROUND: Raised serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and bronchial hyperreactivity
(BHR) are risk factors for the expression of the asthma phenotype. Previous
studies have reported evidence for linkage between these traits and markers on
the 5q23-33 cytokine gene cluster.
OBJECTIVE: To test for linkage between total serum IgE/BHR and microsatellite
markers which map to the 5q23-33 region in an ethnically distinct cohort of
families from Aberdeen, Scotland.
METHODS: We performed a linkage study between five polymorphic markers (spanning 
the chromosome 5q23-33 region) and total serum IgE and BHR traits. A cohort of 67
families, who were recruited originally to study the natural history of wheeze,
were clinically characterized and genotyped for D5S404, IL4, IRF-1, IL9, D5S436
markers. Linkage analyses were performed using the nonparametric Haseman-Elston
algorithm for the quantitative trait log IgE, and the nonparametric LOD score
(NPL-score) of the GENEHUNTER package for the qualitative traits serum IgE and
BHR.
RESULTS: The results of the nonparametric linkage analysis using either the
Haseman-Elston algorithm or NPL-score were consistent and showed no evidence for 
linkage with IgE. There was also no evidence for linkage between the BHR traits
(at cut-off values of PD20FEV1 < 8 mmol and 16 mmol) and any of the tested five
microsatellite markers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents evidence against the presence of a gene with a
major effect on total serum IgE or BHR in the 5q23-33 region, in this ethnic
group.

(bZIP) protein ATF-2-c-jun, are well-characterized components of an enhanceosome 
that mediates virus induction of the human beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene. Here 
we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds
in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between
ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). We demonstrate that
correct orientation of the ATF-2-c-jun binding site is required for virus
induction of the IFN-beta gene and for IRF-3-dependent activation of a composite 
ATF-2- c-jun-IRF site in the IFN-beta promoter. We also show that in vitro the
DNA-bound ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer adopts a fixed orientation upon the binding of 
IRF-3 at an adjacent site in the IFN-beta enhancer and that the DNA-binding
domain of IRF-3 is sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, we show that
the DNA-binding domain of ATF-2 is necessary and sufficient for selective
protein-protein interactions with IRF-3. Strikingly, in vivo chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments with IFN-beta reporter constructs reveal that
recruitment of IRF-3 to the IFN-beta promoter upon virus infection is dependent
on the orientation of the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binding site. These
observations demonstrate functional and physical cooperativity between the bZIP
and IRF transcription factor families and illustrate the critical role of
heterodimeric transcription factors in formation of the IFN-beta enhanceosome.

by gamma interferon and hematopoietic growth factors.

Hematopoietic progenitor cells from Fanconi anemia (FA) group C (FA-C) patients
display hypersensitivity to the apoptotic effects of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)
and constitutively express a variety of IFN-dependent genes. Paradoxically,
however, STAT1 activation is suppressed in IFN-stimulated FA cells, an
abnormality corrected by transduction of normal FANCC cDNA. We therefore sought
to define the specific role of FANCC protein in signal transduction through
receptors that activate STAT1. Expression and phosphorylation of IFN-gamma
receptor alpha chain (IFN-gammaRalpha) and JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases were
equivalent in both normal and FA-C cells. However, in coimmunoprecipitation
experiments STAT1 did not dock at the IFN-gammaR of FA-C cells, an abnormality
corrected by transduction of the FANCC gene. In addition, glutathione
S-transferase fusion genes encoding normal FANCC but not a mutant FANCC bearing
an inactivating point mutation (L554P) bound to STAT1 in lysates of
IFN-gamma-stimulated B cells and IFN-, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor- and stem cell factor-stimulated MO7e cells. Kinetic studies revealed that
the initial binding of FANCC was to nonphosphorylated STAT1 but that subsequently
the complex moved to the receptor docking site, at which point STAT1 became
phosphorylated. The STAT1 phosphorylation defect in FA-C cells was functionally
significant in that IFN induction of IFN response factor 1 was suppressed and
STAT1-DNA complexes were not detected in nuclear extracts of FA-C cells. We also 
determined that the IFN-gamma hypersensitivity of FA-C hematopoietic progenitor
cells does not derive from STAT1 activation defects because
granulocyte-macrophage CFU and erythroid burst-forming units from STAT1(-/-) mice
were resistant to IFN-gamma. However, BFU-E responses to SCF and erythropoietin
were suppressed in STAT(-/-) mice. Consequently, because the FANCC protein is
involved in the activation of STAT1 through receptors for at least three
hematopoietic growth and survival factor molecules, we reason that FA-C
hematopoietic cells are excessively apoptotic because of an imbalance between
survival cues (owing to a failure of STAT1 activation in FA-C cells) and
apoptotic and mitogenic inhibitory cues (constitutively activated in FA-C cells
in a STAT1-independent fashion).

We have identified an interferon-like cytokine, limitin, on the basis of its
ability to arrest the growth of or kill lympho-hematopoietic cells. Limitin
strongly inhibited B lymphopoiesis in vitro and in vivo but had little influence 
on either myelopoiesis or erythropoiesis. Because limitin uses the interferon
alpha/beta receptors and induces interferon regulatory factor-1, it may represent
a previously unknown type I interferon prototype. However, preferential B-lineage
growth inhibition and activation of Janus kinase 2 in a myelomonocytic leukemia
line have not been described for previously known interferons.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) produces intense pulmonary inflammation, in
part, through its ability to induce chemokine synthesis in infected airway
epithelial cells. In this study, we compare mechanisms for induction of the CXC
chemokine IL-8, in human type II alveolar (A549) cells by RSV infection and by
stimulation with the cytokine TNF. Promoter deletion and mutagenesis experiments 
indicate that although the region from -99 to -54 nt is sufficient for
TNF-induced IL-8 transcription, this region alone is not sufficient for
RSV-induced IL-8 transcription. Instead, RSV requires participation of a
previously unrecognized element, spanning from -162 to -132 nt, that we term the 
RSV response element (RSVRE), and a previously characterized element at -132 to
-99 nt, containing an AP-1 binding site. RSV infection of A549 cells induces
increased RSVRE- and AP-1-binding activities and increased synthesis of IFN
regulatory factor-1 protein, which is present in the RSVRE-binding complex. These
data confirm that the IL-8 gene enhancers are controlled in a stimulus-specific
fashion and participation of distinct promoter elements is required to activate
gene transcription. These observations are important for rational design of
inhibitors of RSV-induced lung inflammation.

STAT-induced STAT inhibitor-1 (SSI-1), also referred to as suppressor of cytokine
signaling-1 and JAK-binding protein, is a member of a new family, the members of 
which are negative regulators of cytokine signals. SSI-1 is induced by various
cytokines; however, the transcriptional mechanism of the SSI-1 gene is not fully 
understood. Here, we showed that transcription of the mouse SSI-1 gene was
initiated from six adjoining sites accompanying three GC boxes and a single GC
box-like element near them, but not from the TATA box or an initiator sequence.
We also showed that IFN-gamma induced SSI-1 mRNA more strongly than IL-6 in
NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and that this IFN-gamma effect was mediated by Stat1. To
determine the signal pathway downstream of Stat1, transcriptional activities of
several mutant promoters were examined. The region mediating stimulatory effect
of IFN-gamma to the gene transcription was localized to the -88/-60 region
containing three tandem GAAA units, named variant IFN-gamma-responsive element
(VIRE), while four IFN-gamma activation site (GAS)-like elements located far
upstream were not related to the IFN-gamma response. Gel-shift assays revealed
that IFN-gamma induced IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to VIRE, but not
that of IRF-2 or three components of ISGF3. Furthermore, forced expression of
IRF-1 mimicked and that of IRF-2 inhibited the stimulatory effect of IFN-gamma on
SSI-1 gene transcription. Finally, mouse embryonal fibroblasts lacking IRF-1
showed impaired SSI-1 mRNA induction by IFN-gamma. These results demonstrated
that IRF-1, which is induced by activation of Stat1, mediated transcriptional
activation of the SSI-1 gene by IFN-gamma via VIRE.

Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 impairs the activation of the interferon
regulatory factor-1.

We had previously observed that HPV-16 E7 disturbs the Guanylate Binding Protein 
(GBP)-ISRE reporter activation by IFN-gamma thus suggesting an alteration of the 
IRF-1 function. In this study we examined the mechanism by which E7 affects the
IFN-gamma signals driving the activation of gene transcription. Using 14/2 BRK
cells containing dexamethasone-inducible HPV-16 E7 gene, we observed a large
inhibition of the IRF-1 DNA binding activity upon E7 induction. Concomitantly,
there was no significant change in the levels of IRF-1, indicating that this was 
not due to reduced levels of IRF-1 expression. Likewise, in vitro translated E7
did not affect the IRF-1 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts derived from
IFN-induced cells, thus indicating that the effects of E7 are upstream of IRF-1's
binding to its DNA recognition site. Finally, NFkappaB DNA binding activity was
also inhibited under conditional expression of E7. These data indicate that
HPV-16 E7 inhibits the IRF-1 and NFkappaB function and this could lead to the
impairment of the IFN response in HPV-infected cells. Furthermore, the findings
suggest that different events of the IFN inducible signal cascade seem to be
target for HPV-16 E7.

The genes of interferons and interferon-related factors: localization and
relationships with chromosome aberrations in cancer.

The paper presents a review of data on the localization of interferons (IFNs) and
IFN system genes and their relationship with human diseases, mainly cancer. Genes
of interferon system proteins are located at the sites of breakpoints of the
structural chromosome aberrations in cancer. Thus, any of them are rearranged or 
translocated in various tumor types. As the activity of these genes plays a role 
in cancer development, their rearrangements may be one of the crucial points in
the pathogenesis of some cancer types. Besides, they also take part in organism
immunity against viral infections. Transfection experiments with IFN system genes
have proved the influence of these genes on cancer behavior and may serve as a
basis for clinical gene therapy. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta genes are located at
9p21-22, the site of frequent homozygotic deletions in cancer. Their loss
sensitizes cells to the growth inhibitory actions of exogenous IFNs. The
IFN-gamma gene, a representative of class II genes, is located at 12q24.1.
Transfection of class II IFNs genes to cancer cell lines causes cell
proliferation arrest and augments the expression of HLA antigens, which may be
clinically useful in stimulating the immune destruction of tumor cells. The
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene is located at 5q31, the site of
common deletions in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary leukemias. The 
loss of heterozygosity of this gene was found in MDS, which proves that IRF-1 may
be a tumor suppressor. A transfection of its gene causes neoplastic
transformation arrest. The double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)
gene is located at 2p21-22, a region which is frequently rearranged in leukemia. 
Transfection of a wild type PKR gene reverses neoplastic transformation caused by
transfection of a mutated PKR gene, proving that PKR acts as a dominant negative 
cancer suppressor.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus viral interferon regulatory factor
confers resistance to the antiproliferative effect of interferon-alpha.

Flowers CC(1), Flowers SP, Nabel GJ.

Author information: 
(1)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center,
Department of Internal Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109-0650, USA.

BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a 442 amino
acid polypeptide-designated viral interferon regulatory factor (vIRF) that
displays homology to members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family
that bind to consensus interferon sequences and transactivate cellular genes that
can modulate growth inhibition. Studies were conducted to determine whether vIRF 
affects the growth suppression mediated by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in a
human B lymphocyte cell line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human B lymphocyte cell line Daudi, which is sensitive
to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha, was stably transfected to express 
vIRF, and the proliferative response of vIRF expressing cells to IFN-alpha was
compared with controls. The effect of vIRF on IRF- 1 transactivation was analyzed
by co-transfection of an IFN-alpha-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
reporter and expression plasmids encoding IRF-1 and vIRF. Electrophoretic
mobility shift assays were conducted to determine whether vIRF interferes with
the DNA binding activity of IRF-1.
RESULTS: Daudi human B lymphocyte cells expressing vIRF were resistant to the
antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha, whereas wild-type Daudi or Daudi cells
transformed with vector DNA were growth inhibited by IFN-alpha. The activation of
an interferon-responsive reporter by IFN-alpha or IRF-1 was repressed by
expression of vIRF. IRF-1 DNA binding activity was unaffected by vIRF, and vIRF
alone did not bind to the interferon consensus sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies revealed that vIRF functions to inhibit
interferon-mediated growth control of a human B lymphocyte cell line by targeting
IRF-1 transactivation of interferon-inducible genes. Since KSHV is a B
lymphotropic herpesvirus associated with two forms of B lymphocyte neoplasms,
these effects of vIRF likely contribute to B cell oncogenesis associated with
KSHV infection.

Adenovirus E1A down-regulates LMP2 transcription by interfering with the binding 
of stat1 to IRF1.

Chatterjee-Kishore M(1), van Den Akker F, Stark GR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44145, USA.

The LMP2 gene, which encodes a protein required for efficient presentation of
viral antigens, requires both unphosphorylated Stat1 and IRF1 for basal
expression. LMP2 expression is down-regulated by the adenovirus protein E1A,
which binds to Stat1 and CBP/p300, and by the mutant E1A protein RG2, which binds
to Stat1 but not to CBP/p300, but not by the mutant protein Delta2-36, which does
not bind to either Stat1 or CBP/p300. Stat1 and IRF1 associate in untreated cells
and bind as a complex to the overlapping ICS-2/GAS element of the LMP2 promoter. 
E1A interferes with the formation of this complex by occupying domains of Stat1
that bind to IRF1. These results reveal how adenovirus infection attenuates LMP2 
expression, thereby interfering with the presentation of viral antigens.

The interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2 bind to a segment of the human c-myb
first intron: possible role in the regulation of c-myb expression.

Jefferson University, Bluemle Life Sciences Building, 233 South 10th Street,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

The preferential expression of the protooncogene c-myb in hematopoietic cells is 
in part regulated by a mechanism of transcriptional block in the first intron. By
electrophoresis mobility shift assays using probes corresponding to different
segments of the putative human c-myb intron 1 transcription pause region and
nuclear extracts from myeloid leukemia HL 60 and fibroblast WI 38 cells, we
detected a HL-60-specific DNA-protein complex with a 123-bp fragment containing
binding sites for the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) nuclear proteins.
Formation of the DNA-protein complex was abrogated by competition with an
oligomer containing the wild-type, but not the mutated, IRF binding site and the 
complex was specifically supershifted by the anti-IRF-1 or the anti-IRF-2
antibody. Moreover, in vitro translated IRF-1 or IRF-2 protein did interact with 
the 123-bp c-myb intron 1 fragment. Upon TPA-induced differentiation, c-myb
expression was readily down-modulated in parental HL 60 cells, but not in cells
transfected with an antisense IRF-1 plasmid. Moreover, chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase activity driven by a c-myb promoter containing the entire
intron 1 was suppressed upon IRF-1, but not IRF-2 expression. Together, these
results are consistent with the existence of a functional relationship between
IRF-1 and c-myb in which IRF-1 negatively regulates c-myb expression at the
transcriptional level by a mechanism that may depend on the interaction of IRF-1 
with a segment of the c-myb gene implicated in transcription pausing.

Gram-positive bacteria induce the production of several cytokines in human
leukocytes. The molecular mechanisms involved in Gram-positive bacteria-induced
cytokine production have been poorly characterized. In this work we demonstrate
that both nonpathogenic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and pathogenic Streptococcus
pyogenes (group A streptococci) induce NF-kappa B and STAT DNA-binding activity
in human primary macrophages as analyzed by EMSA. NF-kappa B activation was rapid
and was not inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting 
that these bacteria could directly activate NF-kappa B. STAT1, STAT3, and IFN
regulatory factor-1 DNA binding was induced by both bacteria with delayed
kinetics compared with NF-kappa B. In addition, streptococci induced the
formation of IFN-alpha-specific transcription factor complex and IFN-stimulated
gene factor-3 (ISGF3). STAT1 and STAT3 activation and ISGF3 complex formation
were inhibited by cycloheximide or by neutralization with IFN-alpha/beta-specific
Abs. Streptococci were more potent than lactobacilli in inducing STAT1, ISGF3,
and IFN regulatory factor-1 DNA binding. Accordingly, only streptococci induced
IFN-alpha production. The activation of the IFN-alpha signaling pathway by
streptococci could play a role in the pathogenesis of these bacteria. These
results indicate that extracellular Gram-positive bacteria activate transcription
factors involved in cytokine signaling by two mechanisms: directly, leading to
NF-kappa B activation, and indirectly via cytokines, leading to STAT activation.

The IFN regulatory factor family participates in regulation of Fas ligand gene
expression in T cells.

CA 91010, USA. wchow@coh.org

TCR engagement leads to the transcriptional activation of cytokine genes and
activation-induced cell death. Activated T cells undergo apoptosis upon
expression and ligation of Fas ligand (FasL) to Fas/APO-1 (CD95) receptor. FasL
expression is under the transcriptional regulation of multiple factors. The
present study demonstrates that TCR-inducible FasL expression is also under the
direct influence of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor family. 
Deletion and mutagenesis of a putative IRF-1 binding site in the FasL promoter
results in deficient expression of FasL. EMSAs demonstrate specific FasL promoter
binding by IRF-1 and IRF-2. Forced expression of either IRF-1 or IRF-2 leads to
FasL promoter activation in T cells and FasL expression in heterologous cells.
Finally, suppression of IRF-1 expression in T cells results in deficient
TCR-induced FasL expression. These results confirm that the IRF family
participates in the regulation of FasL gene expression.

Analysis of transcription factors regulating induction of indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase by IFN-gamma.

Du MX(1), Sotero-Esteva WD, Taylor MW.

Author information: 
(1)Indiana University Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of
Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405, USA.

IFN-gamma treatment of the human carcinoma cell line ME180 causes cell death due 
to induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and resulting starvation for
tryptophan. A mutant cell line 3B6A derived from ME180 was resistant to IFN-gamma
because of loss of IDO activity. Cotransfecting an IDO promoter-chloramphenicol
acetyl transferase (CAT) construct with IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) resulted 
in induction of CAT activity in both ME180 and 3B6A cells even in the absence of 
IFN-gamma. This induction was reduced by cotransfection with IRF-2. However,
IRF-1 was not able to restore IDO activity, suggesting a possible repressor site 
outside the IDO promoter region. Stat1alpha (p91) restored both CAT and IDO
activities in 3B6A cells following IFN-gamma treatment. 3B6A cells doubly treated
with IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha or IFN-beta restored IDO activity, although neither 
cytokine on its own could induce IDO. Western blot analysis showed that both
constitutive expression and induction of Stat1alpha by IFN-gamma were reduced in 
3B6A cells, and double treatment of IFN-gamma with IFN-alpha or IFN-beta restored
the expression level of Statla. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated
that Stat1 binds to the IFN-gamma-activated sequence (GAS) region in the IDO
promoter in ME180 cells following IFN-gamma treatment. Our results indicated that
the defect in 3B6A cells was reduced expression of Stat1alpha and that IRF-1,
NF-kappaB, and PKR were all involved to some extent in the induction of IDO
following IFN-gamma treatment.

Degradation of transcription factor IRF-1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
The C-terminal region governs the protein stability.

Nakagawa K(1), Yokosawa H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.

Interferon regulatory factor-1(IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator of
interferon genes and interferon-inducible genes. It has been shown that IRF-1
functions not only as a regulator of the interferon-responsive system but also as
a regulator of cell growth and apoptosis. In addition, it is known that IRF-1 is 
a short-lived protein, but the mechanism that regulates its stability has not yet
been clarified. Here, we show that IRF-1 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. IRF-1 protein degradation in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells was inhibited by
treatment with proteasome-specific inhibitors. Overexpression of IRF-1 protein
and ubiquitin in COS7 cells revealed specific multiubiquitination of IRF-1.
Although the full-length IRF-1 was unstable, IRF-1 mutants with C-terminal
truncations larger than 39 amino acids were found to be almost stable, suggesting
that the 39-residue C-terminal region controls the stability of IRF-1. Further
analysis of the stability of a green fluorescent protein-fusion protein
containing the 39-residue C-terminal region of IRF-1 showed that this C-terminal 
region confers instability on green fluorescent protein, a normally stable
protein, suggesting that this region functions as a protein-degradation signal.
Taking the results together, it can be concluded that the 39-residue C-terminal
region is necessary and sufficient to control the stability of the IRF-1 protein.

Differential induction of JE/MCP-1 in subclones from a murine macrophage cell
line, RAW 264.7: role of kappaB-3 binding protein.

Ueno M(1), Sonoda Y, Funakoshi M, Mukaida N, Nose K, Kasahara T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.

The JE/MCP-1 gene is an immediate-early gene, and its product is a CC chemokine
that attracts monocytes, basophils and T lymphocytes. JE/MCP-1 gene expression is
induced by various inflammatory stimuli, but its transcriptional mechanism is not
fully understood. To address this question, we obtained two subclones from a
parental RAW264.7 cell line, one subline with low JE/MCP-1-producing capacity
(named RAW.c11) and the other with high JE/MCP-1-producing capacity (named
RAW.c25), in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These subclones have no
significant differences in CD14 expression, nitric oxide production, or
production of other cytokines, including TNF-alpha or IL-1alpha/beta. In
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), there were no significant
differences in DNA binding to the NF-kappaB-consensus sequence and interferon
regulatory factor (IRF)-1,2 binding sequences. However, significantly higher
binding activity to the NF-kappaB-like sequence (kappaB-3), which is located in
the promoter region of the JE/MCP-1 gene, was shown by a high producer subclone
than by a low producer subclone. Transient transfection analysis using deletion
mutants of a 0.5-kb region from -467 to +59 identified an LPS-responsive region
in a kappaB-3 site (from -169 to -132) in the high producer subclone. Mutation of
this site markedly reduced sensitivity to LPS in the high producer subclone.
These data suggest that a yet undefined nuclear factor may be involved in
differential JE/MCP-1 gene transcription.

Inhibition of CDK2, CDK4 and cyclin E and increased expression of p27Kip1 during 
treatment with interferon-alpha in carcinoid tumor cells.

IFN-alpha has presented antitumor effect in about 50% of carcinoid tumor
patients, though the antitumor mechanism of IFN-alpha is still to be elucidated. 
In this study we demonstrated that IFN-alpha could result in accumulation of
S-phase population and upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI),
p27. Moreover, IFN-alpha inhibits DNA synthesis assessed by [3H] thymidine
incorporation and colony formation on soft agar. Immunodepletion of p27 increased
CDK2- and cyclin E-associated kinase activities. These data suggest that
IFN-alpha exerts its antiproliferative effects in the neuroendocrine
differentiated cell lines by: 1) inhibition of DNA synthesis and colony
formation, 2) upregulation on the mRNA and protein expressions of the CKI, p27.

Psoriasis is a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by
hyperproliferation and by aberrant differentiation. We found cathepsin D and
zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein, two catalytic enzymes associated with apoptosis and
desquamation, to be present in the stratum corneum of the normal epidermis but
absent from the psoriatic plaque. Psoriasis is characterized by an altered
response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), including the induction of apoptosis in
normal but not in psoriatic keratinocytes, often with opposite effects on gene
expression of suprabasal proteins. We found that IFN-gamma binding and signaling 
were attenuated in psoriasis: The IFN-gamma receptor, the signal transducer and
activator of transcription STAT-1, and the interferon regulatory factor IRF-1
were strongly up-regulated by IFN-gamma in normal keratinocytes, but not in
psoriatic ones. IFN-gamma strongly up-regulated the expression of the catalytic
enzymes cathepsin D and zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein in normal keratinocytes but
down-regulated them in psoriatic ones; the reverse was true of the apoptotic
suppressor bcl-2. We believe that the aberrant response to IFN-gamma plays a
central role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, particularly the disruption of 
apoptosis and desquamation.

Inactivation of interferon regulatory factor-1 tumor suppressor protein by HPV E7
oncoprotein. Implication for the E7-mediated immune evasion mechanism in cervical
carcinogenesis.

In studying biological roles of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 tumor
suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis, we found that HPV E7 is functionally
associated with IRF-1. Binding assays indicate a physical interaction between
IRF-1 and HPV E7 in vivo and in vitro. The carboxyl-terminal transactivation
domain of IRF-1 was required for the interaction. Transient co-expression of E7
significantly inhibits the IRF-1-mediated activation of IFN-beta promoter in
NIH-3T3 cells. Co-transfection of E7 mutants reveals that the pRb-binding portion
of E7 is necessary for the E7-mediated inactivation of IRF-1. It was next
determined whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in the inactivation
mechanism as recently suggested, where the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain
of E7 associates with NURD complex containing HDAC. When trichostatin A, an
inhibitor of HDAC, was treated, the repressing activity of E7 was released in a
dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mutation of zinc finger abrogates such
activity without effect on the interaction with IRF-1. These results suggest that
HPV E7 interferes with the transactivation function of IRF-1 by recruiting HDAC
to the promoter. The immune-promoting role of IRF-1 evokes the idea that our
novel finding might be important for the elucidation of the E7-mediated immune
evading mechanism that is frequently found in cervical cancer.

Cell-specific inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase activation by
leflunomide.

Yugoslavia.

The influence of a novel immunomodulating drug, leflunomide, on iNOS-dependent
nitric oxide (NO) production in rodent macrophages and fibroblasts was
investigated. Leflunomide's active metabolite A77 1726 caused a dose-dependent
decrease of NO production in IFN-gamma-treated L929 fibroblasts. The observed
effect was cell-specific, as well as stimulus-specific, since A77 1726 did not
affect NO production in IFN-gamma-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages or
db-cAMP-treated L929 cells. A77 1726 reduced expression of IFN-gamma-induced iNOS
and IRF-1 mRNA in L929 cells, while iNOS enzymatic activity remained unchanged.
Specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK), PD98059, but not unselective
protein kinase inhibitor genistein, completely mimicked cell-type-specific and
stimulus-specific NO-inhibitory action of leflunomide. Therefore, the recently
described inhibition of MEK/MAP pathway by leflunomide could present a possible
mechanism for its suppression of iNOS activation in L929 fibroblasts. Finally, a 
similar inhibitory effect of A77 1726 on both NO production and iNOS mRNA
expression was observed also in IFN-gamma + LPS-activated murine and rat primary 
fibroblasts.

p27(Kip1) is one of the key regulatory proteins in cell cycle through inhibition 
of pRB phosphorylation by suppression of the activity of several cyclin/Cdk
complexes. The expression of p27(Kip1) has been shown to be controlled by a
posttranslational mechanism, although vitamin D(3) and neuronal differentiation
can also induce its mRNA. Recently, the p27(Kip1) promoter was isolated and
sequenced from a human leukocyte genomic library. In this report, we demonstrate 
that IFNalpha 2b, activates the human p27(Kip1) promoter-driven luciferase
reporter gene in transient expression assays in H82 cells. This induction might
involve two IRF 1-like binding sites present in the p27(Kip1) promoter. To our
knowledge this is the first report on the direct activation of the human
p27(Kip1) promoter by IFNalpha 2b.

Whereas nitric oxide (NO) production is associated with the toxic effect of
cytokines on rodent pancreatic beta-cells, cytokine-induced apoptosis in human
islets may occur independently of NO. The cysteine protease interleukin (IL)-1
converting enzyme (ICE) is a key proapoptotic caspase. Our aim was therefore to
analyze the effect of cytokines on ICE expression in human, rat, and mouse islets
and rat insulinoma cells. ICE messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was highly
up-regulated after 6-, 24-, and 72-h exposure of human islets to interferon
(IFN)gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha + IFNgamma or IL-1beta + TNFalpha + 
IFNgamma, paralleled by increased iNOS (the inducible form of NO synthase)
expression and NO production after exposure to the combined cytokines but not to 
IFNgamma or TNFalpha + IFNgamma. Cytokine-induced NO-independent ICE
transcription was confirmed using iNOS inhibitors. Exposure of rat and mouse
islets, or rat insulinoma cells, for 24 h to IFNgamma alone or in combination
with the two other cytokines also resulted in a highly significant ICE mRNA
expression. ICE transcription was not inducible in islets from IFN regulatory
factor-1 knock-out mice, suggesting a key-role of this transcription-factor in
cytokine-mediated ICE expression in pancreatic islets. In conclusion, cytokines
and IFNgamma in particular increase ICE mRNA expression in pancreatic islet cells
and beta-cell lines, independently of NO synthesis, suggesting that ICE
up-regulation may be involved in cytokine-induced NO-independent apoptosis of
human islets.

Association of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase with the prolactin (PRL) receptor:
alteration in PRL-inducible stat1 (signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1) signaling to the IRF-1 (interferon-regulatory factor 1)
promoter.

USA.

The PRL receptor (PRL-R) signals through the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) and
other non-JAK tyrosine kinases, some of which are preassociated with the PRL-R.
To clone PRL-R interacting proteins, the intracellular domain (ICD) of the long
form of the PRL-R was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human B cell cDNA
library. One PRL-R interacting protein was identified as the 42-kDa form of the
enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). The in vivo interactions in yeast
were further confirmed by an in vitro interaction assay and by
coimmunoprecipitation in transfected mammalian cells. Functionally, OAS reduced
the basal activity of two types of promoters in transiently transfected COS-1
cells. In the presence of PRL, OAS inhibited PRL induction of the immediate early
IRF-1 (interferon-regulatory factor 1) promoter, but not PRL induction of the
differentiation-specific beta-casein promoter, suggesting that OAS exerts
specific effects on immediate early gene promoters. The inhibitory effects of OAS
were accompanied by a reduction in PRL-inducible Stat1 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription 1) DNA binding activity at the IRF-1 GAS
(interferon-gamma-activated sequence) element. These results demonstrate a novel 
interaction of OAS with the PRL-R and suggest a role for OAS in modulating
Stat1-mediated signaling to an immediate early gene promoter. Although previously
characterized as a regulator of ribonuclease (RNase) L antiviral responses, OAS
may have additional effects on cytokine receptor signal transduction pathways.

IFN-alpha1 plasmid construct affords protection against HSV-1 infection in
transfected L929 fibroblasts.

New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the resistance against herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) using an interferon-alpha1 (IFN-alpha1) transgene in
specifically targeted cells in vitro. Transfection of mouse fibroblast L929 cells
with an IFN-alpha1 plasmid construct reduced viral load and viral gene expression
in a time-dependent fashion. Supernatants from IFN-alpha1-transfected cells
augmented natural killer (NK) cell activity, and such an effect was antagonized
with neutralizing antibody to IFN-alpha/beta. In addition, transfected cells
displayed an increase in the IFN inducible genes (2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase
[2',5'-OAS], T cell-specific guanine nucleotide triphosphate-binding protein, IFN
regulatory factor 1 [IRF-1], and major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class I) 
compared with plasmid vector-treated controls. Collectively, these results show
that IFN-alpha1 transfection of cells in vitro induces or upregulates a spectrum 
of IFN-regulated genes involved in the direct or indirect antiviral action of
this cytokine. In addition, the transgene significantly increases the resistance 
of transfected cells in vitro to HSV-1 infection.

pathway and interferon regulatory factor-1.

The expression of angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor is closely associated
with cell growth, differentiation, and/or injury. We examined the effect of
interferon (IFN)-gamma on AT(2) receptor expression in mouse fibroblast R3T3
cells and demonstrated that IFN-gamma treatment increased the expression of AT(2)
receptor mRNA as well as its binding. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 was
induced in mouse fibroblast R3T3 cells after IFN-gamma stimulation, and
electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed an increase in IRF-1 binding with the
IRF-specific binding sequence in the AT(2) receptor gene promoter region after
IFN-gamma stimulation. The IRF-1 gene promoter contains an IFN-gamma-activated
sequence (GAS) motif for possible binding of signal transducer(s) and
activator(s) of transcription (STAT). Indeed, in R3T3 cells, IFN-gamma treatment 
resulted in rapid activation of Janus kinase (Jak) 1, Jak2, and STAT1 via
tyrosine phosphorylation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the GAS probe
revealed increased STAT1 binding to the IRF-1 gene promoter in response to
IFN-gamma stimulation. Transfection of GAS-binding oligonucleotides inhibited the
effect of IFN-gamma on IRF-1 production, resulting in the AT(2) receptor
trans-activation. Taken together, our data show that IFN-gamma upregulates AT(2) 
receptor expression in R3T3 cells via the activation of the intracellular
Jak/STAT pathway and production of IRF-1.

Inhibition of Th1 immune response by glucocorticoids: dexamethasone selectively
inhibits IL-12-induced Stat4 phosphorylation in T lymphocytes.

Glucocorticoids are widely used in the therapy of inflammatory, autoimmune, and
allergic diseases. As the end-effectors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis, endogenous glucocorticoids also play an important role in suppressing
innate and cellular immune responses. Previous studies have indicated that
glucocorticoids inhibit Th1 and enhance Th2 cytokine secretion. IL-12 promotes
Th1 cell-mediated immunity, while IL-4 stimulates Th2 humoral-mediated immunity. 
Here, we examined the regulatory effect of glucocorticoids on key elements of
IL-12 and IL-4 signaling. We first investigated the effect of dexamethasone on
IL-12-inducible genes and showed that dexamethasone inhibited IL-12-induced
IFN-gamma secretion and IFN regulatory factor-1 expression in both NK and T
cells. This occurred even though the level of expression of IL-12 receptors and
IL-12-induced Janus kinase phosphorylation remained unaltered. However,
dexamethasone markedly inhibited IL-12-induced phosphorylation of Stat4 without
altering its expression. This was specific, as IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation
was not affected, and mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, as it was
antagonized by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486. Moreover,
transfection experiments showed that dexamethasone reduced responsiveness to
IL-12 through the inhibition of Stat4-dependent IFN regulatory factor-1 promoter 
activity. We conclude that blocking IL-12-induced Stat4 phosphorylation, without 
altering IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation, appears to be a new suppressive
action of glucocorticoids on the Th1 cellular immune response and may help
explain the glucocorticoid-induced shift toward the Th2 humoral immune response.

Antiproliferative effects of retinoic acid/interferon in cervical carcinoma cell 
lines: cooperative growth suppression of IRF-1 and p53.

Um SJ(1), Kim EJ, Hwang ES, Kim SJ, Namkoong SE, Park JS.

Author information:

Retinoids and interferons have been implicated in the growth regulation of
cervical cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully defined.
To analyze detailed mechanisms, HPV-positive (HeLa, CaSki), HPV-negative (C33A,
HT-3) and non-cervical Cos-1 cell lines were treated with I microM
all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and/or 10 ng/ml interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The
growth of RA-treated HeLa cells was less effectively suppressed than that of
IFN-gamma-treated ones. A combination of RA and IFN-gamma leads to an additive
antiproliferative effect on the cell growth. CaSki cell growth was also inhibited
by IFN-gamma but was little stimulated by RA treatment, and the IFN effect was
attenuated when IFN-gamma was combined with RA. HPV-negative C33A and HT-3 cells,
which are defective in p53 and Rb, and Cos- 1 cells were weakly or not responsive
to all combined treatments. The molecular mechanism underlying the differential
effects of RA/IFN on HeLa and C33A cells was investigated. Combined RA/IFN-gamma 
treatment caused a marked increase in the level of IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) in HeLa, whereas no induction of IRF-1 was observed in C33A, consistent
with the findings that IFN signaling is functional in HeLa but is defective in
C33A cells. The increase of p53 in HeLa cells might account for the
down-regulation of HPV-18 E6 gene expression by RA/IFN-gamma. Furthermore,
RA/IFN-gamma treatment resulted in the concurrent induction of p21WAF1 CDK
inhibitor and dephosphorylation of Rb protein. Transient co-expression of IRF-1
and p53 led to the cooperative activation of the p21WAF1 promoter. Our results
indicate that 2 transcription factors, increased in response to RA/IFN-gamma,
cooperate functionally to regulate the cell cycle through the activation of a
common p21WAF1 gene in HeLa cells.

Regulation of CD26/DPPIV gene expression by interferons and retinoic acid in
tumor B cells.

Interferons (IFNs alpha, beta and gamma) and all trans retinoic acid (RA) have
the ability to activate genes with GAS sites. We have found that the promoter of 
CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) contains a consensus GAS site TTCnnnGAA
located at bp-35 to -27, and computer analysis confirmed this sequence to be a
putative Stat binding site. Consistent with this finding, we show that IFNs and
RA rapidly enhanced CD26 gene and protein expression in chronic B lymphocytic
leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Immunoblot analyses revealed that unstimulated B-CLL
cells expressed detectable levels of serine/tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1alpha,
and RA and IFN-gamma treatment led to increased levels of tyrosine
phosphorylation of Stat1alpha and its nuclear accumulation. As shown by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay, RA and IFN-gamma increased the binding of a
nuclear protein to the GAS-CD26 element. Shift-Western blotting identified
Stat1alpha as the GAS-CD26 binding factor. Augmented levels of CD26 protein in
malignant B cells cultured with IFNs or RA coincided with the enhancement of
DPPIV activity. Taken together, our results are in favor of the IFN-/RA-mediated 
upregulation of CD26/DPPIV in B-CLL through the signaling pathway involving
Stat1alpha and the GAS response element of CD26 promoter.

Modulation of major histocompatibility class II protein expression by
varicella-zoster virus.

(1)Departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University
School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5208, USA.

We sought to investigate the effects of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection on
gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-stimulated expression of cell surface major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on human fibroblasts.
IFN-gamma treatment induced cell surface MHC class II expression on 60 to 86% of 
uninfected cells, compared to 20 to 30% of cells which had been infected with VZV
prior to the addition of IFN-gamma. In contrast, cells that were treated with
IFN-gamma before VZV infection had profiles of MHC class II expression similar to
those of uninfected cell populations. Neither IFN-gamma treatment nor VZV
infection affected the expression of transferrin receptor (CD71). In situ and
Northern blot hybridization of MHC II (MHC class II DR-alpha) RNA expression in
response to IFN-gamma stimulation revealed that MHC class II DR-alpha mRNA
accumulated in uninfected cells but not in cells infected with VZV. When skin
biopsies of varicella lesions were analyzed by in situ hybridization, MHC class
II transcripts were detected in areas around lesions but not in cells that were
infected with VZV. VZV infection inhibited the expression of Stat 1alpha and Jak2
proteins but had little effect on Jak1. Analysis of regulatory events in the
IFN-gamma signaling pathway showed that VZV infection inhibited transcription of 
interferon regulatory factor 1 and the MHC class II transactivator. This is the
first report that VZV encodes an immunomodulatory function which directly
interferes with the IFN-gamma signal transduction via the Jak/Stat pathway and
enables the virus to inhibit IFN-gamma induction of cell surface MHC class II
expression. This inhibition of MHC class II expression on VZV-infected cells in
vivo may transiently protect cells from CD4(+) T-cell immune surveillance,
facilitating local virus replication and transmission during the first few days
of cutaneous lesion formation.

Detection of interferon regulatory factor-1 in lamina propria mononuclear cells
in Crohn's disease.

Center, New Orleans, USA.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, is
stimulated by interferon-gamma and regulates the expression of several genes
implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, including
interleukin-6, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and inducible
nitric oxide synthase. Interferon regulatory factor-1 also stimulates naive CD4+ 
T-cells to differentiate into T-helper-1 cells, the T-cell subset that appears to
be upregulated in Crohn's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the
expression of IRF-1 in the nuclei of lamina propria mononuclear cells in situ in 
colonoscopic biopsy specimens from pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, in
patients with ulcerative colitis, and in control patients with no histopathologic
abnormalities.
METHODS: Archival paraffin-embedded tissue sections were obtained from 25
pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 6 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 
12 control patients who had undergone colonoscopy. Tissue sections were stained
with polyclonal rabbit anti-human antisera to IRF-1 and
horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated, biotinylated, goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody. Slides were scored and scores compared among patient groups using
analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly higher IRF-1 scores (95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.70-2.04) than patients with ulcerative colitis (95%
CI, 0.92-1.23) or control subjects (95% CI, 1.11-1.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of IRF-1 in lamina propria mononuclear cells
from patients with Crohn's disease may be relevant to the pathogenesis of Crohn's
disease.

Stat5b inhibits NFkappaB-mediated signaling.

Luo G(1), Yu-Lee L.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine,
Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) are latent
transcription factors that participate in cytokine signaling by regulating the
expression of early response genes. Our previous studies showed that Stat5
functions not only as a transcriptional activator but also as a transcriptional
inhibitor, depending on the target promoter. This report further investigates the
mechanism of Stat5b-mediated inhibition and demonstrates that PRL-inducible
Stat5b inhibits nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB) signaling to both the interferon 
regulatory factor-1 promoter and to the thymidine kinase promoter containing
multimerized NFkappaB elements (NFkappaB-TK). Further, PRL-inducible Stat5b
inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling presumably by inhibiting
endogenous NFkappaB. This Stat5b-mediated inhibitory effect on NFkappaB signaling
is independent of Stat5b-DNA interactions but requires the carboxyl terminus of
Stat5b as well as Stat5b nuclear translocation and/or accumulation, suggesting
that Stat5b is competing for a nuclear factor(s) necessary for NFkappaB-mediated 
activation of target promoters. Increasing concentrations of the coactivator
p300/CBP reverses Stat5b inhibition at both the interferon-regulatory factor-1
and NFkappaB-TK promoters, suggesting that Stat5b may be squelching limiting
coactivators via protein-protein interactions as one mechanism of promoter
inhibition. These results further substantiate our observation that Stat factors 
can function as transcriptional inhibitors. Our studies reveal cross-talk between
the Stat5b and NFkappaB signal transduction pathways and suggest that
Stat5b-mediated inhibition of target promoters occurs at the level of
protein-protein interactions and involves competition for limiting coactivators.

A non-nucleotide-bridged DNA decoy inhibits renal epithelial nitric oxide
synthase expression.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Georgetown University MedicalCenter, 
Washington, D.C 20007, USA.

A non-nucleotide-bridged DNA decoy inhibits renal epithelial nitric oxide
synthase expression.BACKGROUND: The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) is subject to strict tissue-specific transcriptional control. In mouse
renal epithelium, an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced signaling protein,
IFN-gamma regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), appears to mediate the induction of iNOS
expression by cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
METHODS: We used a novel technique, namely, blockade of cytosolic IRF-1 activity 
with a triethyleneglycol-bridged decoy DNA oligonucleotide (ODN) containing the
IRF-1 consensus binding sequences present in the iNOS promoter to inhibit iNOS
gene expression. Cultured mouse renal epithelial cells were treated with a
combination of LPS (1 microg/mL) and IFN (100 U/mL) in the absence or presence of
IRF-1 decoy ODN followed by determinations of NO production and iNOS protein and 
mRNA expression.
RESULTS: Treatment with IRF-1 decoy ODN resulted in concentration-dependent
inhibition of NO production and a marked reduction in iNOS protein and mRNA
levels. A scrambled ODN failed to affect LPS/IFN-stimulated NO production or iNOS
protein and mRNA levels. Transcriptional assays showed that the IRF-1 decoy ODN
inhibited transcriptional activity of an iNOS promoter-CAT gene construct.
CONCLUSIONS: Decoy ODN-based techniques effectively inhibit iNOS expression in
renal epithelium and represent a potentially useful approach for selective
blockade of this enzyme in pathologic conditions associated with excessive NO
production.

Expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 and 2 in hematopoietic cells of
children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

Author information: 
(1)Children's Hospital, University of Freiburg, Germany.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator in the
interferon system and acts as a tumor suppressor. The structurally related IRF-2 
represses the effects of IRF-1 by competitive binding to the same DNA sequence
elements. Changes in the relative balance between IRF-1 and IRF-2 lead to
dysregulation of cell growth and may play a role in the development of
neoplasias. The loss of functional IRF-1 has been observed in a number of
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia, suggesting a
potentially critical role of IRF-1 in leukemogenesis. We studied the expression
of both transcription factors in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells
of children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) using RT-PCR and
Southern blot hybridization. No significant difference between the expression
levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 could be detected in PB and BM of patients with JMML
and normal donors. Although our results are preliminary they suggest that neither
the tumor suppressor gene IRF-1 nor the oncogene IRF-2 is involved in the
pathogenesis of JMML.

Surface expression of the IFN-gamma R2 chain is regulated by intracellular
trafficking in human T lymphocytes.

JL, Forni G, Novelli F.

The surface and cytoplasmic expressions of the transducing chain (IFN-gamma R2)
of the heterodimeric IFN-gamma receptor on human T lymphocytes have been
investigated. We show that its surface expression is low, whereas high
cytoplasmic levels are found in both resting and PHA-activated T lymphocytes.
This low expression does not prevent activated T cells from responding to
IFN-gamma, because it induces IFN-regulatory factor 1 expression. Low surface
IFN-gamma R2 expression appears to be due to recycling between cytoplasmic stores
and the cell surface, which does not depend on signals mediated by endogenous
IFN-gamma, because IFN-gamma R2 surface expression is low, and its
internalization is equally observed in patients with inherited IFN-gamma R1 gene 
deficiency and in healthy donors. Moreover, IFN-gamma R2 internalization in T
lymphoblasts from healthy donors was not affected by the presence of
anti-IFN-gamma-neutralizing or anti-IFN-gamma R1-blocking mAb. In conclusion,
these data illustrate a new mechanism whereby human T cells limit the surface
expression of IFN-gamma R2 in a ligand-independent manner.

Lack of IRF-1 expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia and in a subset of acute
myeloid leukemias with del(5)(q31).

One allele of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional activator
of genes critical for growth suppression, differentiation, and apoptosis, is
usually deleted in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and myelodysplasias (MDS) with
deletion of chromosome 5q31. Accelerated exon skipping of IRF-1, resulting in
transcripts lacking a translation initiation site, has been hypothesized as a
means of functional inactivation of IRF-1 in AML/MDS. To test this hypothesis, we
developed quantitative competitive RT-PCR assays to measure levels of full length
and exon-skipped IRF-1 transcripts and measured IRF-1 proteins by Western
blotting in a series of 45 samples of AML (13: -5/del5(q); 11: t(15;17); 7:
t(8;21); and 7: inv(16)), normal blood and marrow, and myeloid cell lines. In
contrast to AMLs with inv(16) or t(8;21), two AML samples with del(5q) had
accelerated exon skipping and relatively low levels of full-length transcripts,
while a third sample had very low transcript levels; IRF-1 proteins were not
expressed and could not be induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma). An additional 
six AML cases with -5/del(5q) had moderate exon-skipping and lacked constitutive 
IRF-1 proteins; however IRF-1 proteins were IFNgamma-inducible. Unexpectedly, all
primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) samples lacked IRF-1 protein and most 
exhibited accelerated exon skipping; furthermore, IRF-1 could not be induced by
IFNgamma or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) which both induce IRF-1 in the NB4 APL
cell line. Thus, accelerated exon skipping results in a loss of IRF-1 expression 
and function that cannot be overcome by exposure to inducing agents in a subset
of AML patients with -5/del(5q) and in APL.

A candidate interferon-gamma activated site (GAS element) in the HLA-G promoter
does not bind nuclear proteins.

The HLA-G gene is highly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, where it is
believed to participate in the generation and maintenance of maternal tolerance
to the fetal semiallograft. This gene has two elements through which
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) could act to enhance its rate of transcription, an
Enhancer A/ICS region and a candidate IFN-gamma activated site (GAS). In this
study we investigated functionality of this candidate HLA-G GAS. Two
HLA-G-expressing cell lines were tested, the human myelomonocytic cell line,
U937, and a mouse fibroblast cell line, S14/8, which is stably transfected with
the full length HLA-G gene. Nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma-treated U937 and
S14/8 cells bound the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene GAS sequence
(TTC CCCGAA) but not the HLA-G gene's candidate GAS sequence (TTTCGAGAA). Excess 
unlabeled HLA-G-GAS oligonucleotide failed to inhibit binding of the IRF-1-GAS
using the same nuclear extracts. These data indicate that a sequence in the HLA-G
gene which would normally permit cytokine enhancement of gene expression, the GAS
element, is nonfunctional. This is also true of another regulatory sequence, the 
Enhancer A/ICS element, suggesting that defects in IFN-gamma response elements
prevent inappropriate up-regulation of HLA-G gene expression at the
maternal-fetal interface.

Protection against the mortality associated with disease models mediated by TNF
and IFN-gamma in mice lacking IFN regulatory factor-1.

Mortality and cytokine production associated with disease models mediated by TNF-
and IFN-gamma were studied in mice lacking IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1
knockout (KO) mice showed no mortality after the injection of a dose of LPS
lethal in intact control mice (LD95). KO mice showed lower circulating levels of 
TNF and IFN-gamma than controls. KO mice also showed lower TNF and IFN-gamma mRNA
in the spleen or liver than controls. KO mice had smaller spleens than controls, 
which contained similar percentage but lower absolute count of macrophages and
lower percentage and absolute count of NK cells. IRF-1 KO mice survived longer
than controls after the coinjection of LPS and galactosamine. IRF-1 KO mice also 
showed less mortality than controls after the injection of Con A and in a model
of cerebral malaria. After the injection of a lethal dose of TNF (LD88),
mortality was similar between KO and intact mice. Mortality was also similar
after the coinjection of two nonlethal doses of TNF and IFN-gamma, a lethal
combination (LD100). This study shows that the lack of IRF-1 protects against the
mortality associated with disease models mediated by TNF and IFN-gamma but has no
effect on the mortality directly induced by TNF and IFN-gamma. The lack of IRF-1 
appears to result in impaired production of TNF and IFN-gamma, reflecting a
down-regulation of gene expression in the liver and spleen as well as a reduction
in the number of splenic cells.

Molecular role of ascorbate in enhancement of NO production in activated
macrophage-like cell line, J774.1.

Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Japan.

Ascorbate-enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and 
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-activated macrophage J774.1 cells through the
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway. The iNOS gene was synergistically
induced by LPS and IFN-gamma. The inductive mechanism of ascorbate on the iNOS
gene was studied by examining the degradation of I kappa B alpha by Western
blotting, activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) by gel shift
assays, and protein levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in LPS- and 
IFN-gamma-activated cells. Ascorbate had no effect on the onset of either I kappa
B alpha degradation or the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, but it delayed
the recovery of I kappa B alpha. The prolonged degradation of I kappa B alpha
caused by ascorbate in LPS- and IFN-gamma-activated cells paralleled elevated
NF-kappa B binding to DNA, which led to an increase in the iNOS protein level.
Ascorbate alone did not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B
activation. Furthermore, ascorbate exerted no effect on the expression of I kappa
B alpha and ubiquitin genes in the activated cells. Ascorbate could modulate
NF-kappa B DNA binding activity in response to combined LPS and IFN-gamma
activation, which increases NO production in activated macrophages.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 mediates the interferon-gamma induction of the
human immunoproteasome subunit multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1.

N-0316 Oslo, Norway.

Proteasomes generate antigenic peptides from intracellular proteins for
presentation to the immune system by the major histocompatibility complex class I
molecules. The antiviral cytokine IFN-gamma alters the catalytic specificity of
proteasomes by inducing the synthesis of an alternative set of three
proteolytically active proteasome subunits. We have analyzed the mechanism of
IFN-gamma induction for the IFN-gamma-induced subunit multicatalytic
endopeptidase complex-like 1 (MECL1). The human MECL1 promoter contains two
interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs), generally known to bind members 
of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. The importance of these
elements for IFN-gamma induction of MECL1 was addressed by transfecting an
endothelial cell line with MECL1 promoter constructs. By deletions and mutations 
of the ISRE sequences, we demonstrated that both ISREs were needed for full
IFN-gamma induction of the reporter gene. The second (downstream) ISRE was
essential for both IFN-gamma-induced and basal transcriptional activity of the
promoter. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, anti-IRF-1 antibodies
supershifted an IFN-gamma-induced protein binding specifically to both ISRE
sequences, whereas IRF-2 bound the second ISRE before induction. Co-transfection 
of IRF-1 resulted in induced MECL1 promoter activity in the absence of IFN-gamma.
These data indicate that the IFN-gamma induction of human MECL1 is mediated by
IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1.

Recruitment of CREB-binding protein by PU.1, IFN-regulatory factor-1, and the IFN

Activation of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase requires interaction
between the oxidase components p47phox, p67phox, p22phox, and gp91phox. IFN-gamma
induces transcription of the genes encoding p67phox (the NCF2 gene) and gp91phox 
(the CYBB gene) during monocyte differentiation, and also in mature monocytes. In
these studies, we identify an NCF2 cis element, necessary for IFN-gamma-induced
p67phox expression, and determine that this element is activated by cooperation
between the transcription factors PU.1, IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and the
IFN consensus-binding protein (ICSBP). Previously, we identified a CYBB cis
element, necessary for IFN-gamma-induced gp91phox expression, and also activated 
by this transcription factor combination. In these investigations, we determine
that recruitment of a coactivator protein, CBP (the CREBbinding protein), to the 
CYBB or NCF2 promoter is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by
PU.1, IRF1, and ICSBP. Also, we determine that the multiprotein interaction of
CBP with PU. 1, IRF1, and ICSBP requires either the CYBB- or NCF2--binding site. 
Because IFN-gamma induces simultaneous expression of p67phox and gp91phox, these 
investigations identify a molecular event that coordinates oxidase gene
transcription during the inflammatory response. Also, these investigations
identify CBP recruitment by cooperation between PU.1, IRF1, and ICSBP as a novel 
molecular mechanism for IFN-gamma-induced activation of myeloid genes that are
involved in the system of host defense.

Localization of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in nonpregnant human
endometrium: expression of IRF-1 is up-regulated by prolactin during the
secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.

PRL expression in the human uterus is up-regulated during the mid to late
secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. This coincides with up-regulation of the 
expression of the PRL receptor, which is localized primarily to the endometrial
glandular epithelial cells. Recent data have demonstrated activation of the Jak
(Janus kinase)/Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling 
pathway in the secretory endometrium after stimulation with exogenous PRL.
However, the target genes for the action of PRL on the endometrial epithelial
cells have not been elucidated. In this study we have investigated the
pattern/site of expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1) as well as the effect of exogenous PRL on the transcription of
IRF-1 in the human endometrium during the mid to late secretory phase of the
menstrual cycle. Expression of the IRF-1 gene was confirmed by RNase protection
assays using a 260-bp homologous [alpha-32P]UTP-labeled IRF-1 complementary
ribonucleic acid (RNA) probe and 10 microg total RNA extracted from human
endometrium (n = 5) collected between days 19 and 26 of the menstrual cycle.
Northern and Western blot analyses were conducted on secretory phase human
endometrium (n = 3) using human [alpha-32P]dCTP-labeled IRF-1 complementary DNA
and antihuman IRF-1 antibody. Expression of the IRF-1 gene in the secretory phase
endometrium was encoded by a RNA transcript of approximately 2.1 kb and a protein
of 48 kDa. Furthermore, expression of the IRF-1 gene in the secretory phase
endometrium was localized by immunohistochemistry predominantly to the glandular 
epithelial cells as has been shown previously for the PRL receptor. To
investigate the effect of PRL on expression of IRF-1, human endometrial biopsies 
(n = 3) collected between days 24-26 of the menstrual cycle were cultured in the 
presence of cycloheximide with or without 100 ng/mL human PRL for 2 and 4 h.
Culture of endometrial tissue with PRL for 2 and 4 h resulted in 2.9 +/- 0.3-fold
(P < 0.01) and 1.7 +/- 0.1-fold induction of expression of the IRF-1 gene,
respectively. These data demonstrate the expression of the transcription factor
IRF-1 in the glandular epithelium of the endometrium and its regulation by PRL
during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Previous observations of the
temporal up-regulation of expression of both PRL and PRL receptors in the
secretory human endometrium and their localization to the stromal and glandular
compartments, respectively, suggest that endometrial PRL mediates transcription
of the IRF-1 gene in a paracrine fashion.

Selective pressure as an essential force in molecular evolution of myeloid
leukemic clones: a view from the window of Fanconi anemia.

Specific chromosomal deletions are commonly found in bone marrow cells of
children with Fanconi anemia (FA) whose disease has evolved to myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Identical deletions are found in 
adults with MDS/AML with a history of exposure to alkylating agents (secondary
MDS/AML). While deleted chromosomal regions likely harbor genes encoding proteins
with tumor suppressor (TS) function, such genes have not been identified and the 
environmental forces by which these mutant clones are selected remain unclear. A 
consistent signaling abnormality in cells bearing mutations of the Fanconi anemia
complementation group C (FA-C) gene (FANCC) has revealed a potential selective
force. Hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients and mice with FANCC mutations
are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of IFNgamma and TNFalpha.
Consequently, clonal outgrowths in FA likely result from strong selective
pressure for stem and/or progenitor cells resistant to these inhibitory
cytokines. Additional mutations that inactivate signaling pathways for these
inhibitors would create a cell with a profound proliferative advantage over its
apoptosis-prone counterparts. Here, we present preliminary evidence supporting a 
selection-based model of leukemic evolution and argue that MDS in FA patients is 
a de facto model of secondary MDS in non-FA adults.

Co-occupancy of the interferon regulatory element of the class II transactivator 
(CIITA) type IV promoter by interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2.

Class II transactivator (CIITA) activates the expression of major
histocompatibility class II genes, which encode antigen-presenting molecules
recognized by the T-cell receptor of CD4+ T cells. IFN-gamma induced CIITA
transcription in many cell types is directed by the CIITA Type IV promoter. Here 
we report that the human CIITA Type IV promoter IRF-E binds IRF-1 and can be
activated by exogenous expression of IRF-1. Surprisingly, the CIITA Type IV
promoter IRF-E is also activated by IRF-2, another member of the IRF family that 
generally acts as a transcriptional repressor. In addition, we found that IRF-1
and IRF-2 synergistically activate the CIITA Type IV promoter. Electrophoretic
mobility shift assays revealed that IRF-1 and IRF-2 can simultaneously occupy the
IRF-E of the CIITA Type IV promoter, suggesting a novel mechanism for the role of
these two proteins in promoter activation. Our results also indicate that IRF-1
and IRF-2 can cooperatively activate and co-occupy the IRF-E of the guanylate
binding protein (GBP) promoter. Finally, CIITA induction by IFN-gamma does not
occur in a pancreatic tumor cell line that expresses a mutated IRF-2,
representing the first IRF-2 mutation identified in a human tumor cell line.

Identification and partial characterization of FRAG-6, a novel
interferon-stimulated gene that is expressed in an IRF-1-INDEPENDENT manner.

Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil.

In order to identify new interferon-stimulated genes that could help in the
better understanding of the mechanism of action of interferons (IFNs), we decided
to compare, by differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR), the pattern of gene
expression between IFN-alpha treated and untreated mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs). Here we describe the initial characterization of a new cDNA fragment,
named FRAG-6, that is expressed only upon IFN stimulation. The IFN-induced
expression of this new gene can be observed in both wild-type and IRF-1-deficient
MEF. FRAG-6 cDNA hybridizes with an mRNA of 6-9 kb that is induced by IFNs in a
time-dependent manner. Analysis of the cloned nucleotide sequence revealed a 174 
amino acid (aa) open reading frame (ORF) contained within the 576 bp. No
significant homology with known nucleotide or protein sequences was observed.
FRAG-6 is induced in vitro upon treatment of wild type or IRF-1-null cells with
IFN-alpha or -gamma, but not with TNF or IL-1. Treatment of mice with imiquimod, 
a potent inducer of IFN, led to induced expression of FRAG-6 mRNA in various
organs from wild type or IRF-1-deficient mice, but not from STAT-1 or type I IFN 
receptor deficient animals. Our results demonstrate that FRAG-6 mRNA induction by
interferons is IRF-1-independent and it is likely to be activated by the JAK/STAT
pathway. Further characterization of FRAG-6 will help us in the understanding of 
the mechanism of action of IFNs.

Paired Stat6 C-terminal transcription activation domains required both for
inhibition of an IFN-responsive promoter and trans-activation.

Author information:

TN 37232, USA.

The cytokines IL-4 and IFN-gamma exert biologically antagonistic effects that in 
part reflect opposing influences on gene transcription. While the molecular
mechanisms for IL-4-mediated transcription activation have been extensively
studied, little is known about molecular mechanisms required for IL-4 inhibition 
of IFN-gamma signaling. We have investigated IL-4 inhibition of the
IFN-gamma-inducible promoter for IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). In a cell line 
with low endogenous Stat6, increasing levels of activated Stat6 at constant doses
of IFN-gamma and IL-4 leads to inhibition of the IRF-1 promoter. The
Stat1-dependent IFN-gamma activation sequence element of the IRF-1 promoter is a 
target for Stat6-mediated inhibition despite apparently normal Stat1 DNA binding.
However, our data are inconsistent with competition between Stat1 and Stat6 for
access to the IRF-1 IFN-gamma activation sequence or for an essential coactivator
as a mechanism for this Stat6-mediated inhibition. Instead, the data demonstrate 
that a threshold of Stat6 transcription activation domains is required for
IL-4-dependent inhibition. The findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism in 
which the Stat6 transcription activation domains play a critical role in the
IL-4-mediated inhibition of an IFN-gamma-inducible promoter.

The pathogenesis of sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disorder, is
mediated through immunoregulatory pathways. While sarcoidosis clusters in
families, inherited risk factors remain undefined. In search of possible
sarcoidosis susceptibility genes, we examined anonymous polymorphic genetic
markers tightly linked to six different candidate gene regions on chromosomes
2q13, 5q31, 6p23-25, 7p14-15, 14q11 and 22q11. These candidate regions contain T 
cell receptor, interleukin (IL) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) genes. Our
study population consisted of 105 African-American sarcoidosis cases and 95
unrelated healthy controls. The allelic frequency distribution of two out of the 
six markers, IL-1 alpha marker (p = 0.010) on 2q13 and the F13A marker (p =
0.0006) on 6p23-25, was statistically significantly different in cases compared
with controls. The two alleles most strongly associated with sarcoidosis were
IL-1 alpha*137 (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.36-4.98)
and F13A*188 (OR = 2.42; 95% CI = 1.37-4.30). Individuals that had both of these 
alleles were at a six-fold increased risk for sarcoidosis (OR = 6.19; 95% CI =
2.54-15.10). Restricting the analysis to cases with at least one first or
second-degree relative affected with sarcoidosis increased the OR to 15.38. IL-1 
levels are elevated in sarcoidosis and the F13A marker is tightly linked to a
gene that codes for a newly identified interferon regulatory factor protein
(IRF-4), which is thought to play a role in T cell effector functions. Our
results suggest genetic susceptibility to sarcoidosis may be conferred by more
than one immune-related gene that act synergistically on disease risk.

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) induces apoptosis in many tumor cell lines and
sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor family members.
IFN-gamma induces the expression of many early response genes such as interferon 
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) by activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) factor proteins. We found that ME180 cells became resistant 
to IFN-gamma-induced cell death after 4-5 passages in culture. These resistant
cells were characterized by a loss of STAT1 expression and a loss of inducible
IRF-1 expression. We describe for the first time the emergence of a
STAT1-deficient ME180 cell line.

Interferons are a large family of multifunctional secreted proteins involved in
antiviral defense, cell growth regulation and immune activation. Viral infection 
induces transcription of multiple IFN genes, a response that is in part mediated 
by the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). The initially characterized members 
IRF-1 and IRF-2 are now part of a growing family of transcriptional regulators
that has expanded to nine members. The functions of the IRFs have also expanded
to include distinct roles in biological processes such as pathogen response,
cytokine signaling, cell growth regulation and hematopoietic development. The aim
of this review is to provide an update on the novel discoveries in the area of
IRF transcription factors and the important roles of the new generation of
IRFs--particularly IRF-3, IRF-4 and IRF-7.

We analyzed product quality to determine the applicability of
proliferation-controlled mammalian cells for recombinant pharmaceutical protein
production. Baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells were engineered to express a
dicistronic, stabilized, self-selecting growth control system consisting of a
beta-estradiol-activatable transcription factor IRF-1 fusion protein. IRF-1
activity led to a reduced growth rate, whereas productivity, protein integrity,
and glycosylation pattern of the industrially relevant secreted pharmaceutical
glycoprotein erythropoietin remained consistent, showing that this technique has 
the potential for improving the consistency of high-quality pharmaceutical
products and thus warrants further development.

We have examined the relationship between intracellular signalling pathways and
loss of differentiated function during hepatocyte isolation and culture. We have 
shown that isolation induces the activation of the interferon stimulatory
response element (ISRE). This activation was transient and peaked at 3 h before
it returned to basal by 24 h of culture. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
was shown to be important for generation of ISRE complexes by electromobility
shift assays and supershift intervention. IRF-1 was translocated to the nucleus
in parallel with changes to ISRE complex formation. The p38 kinase inhibitor, SB 
203580, diminished the formation of ISRE binding complexes. Hence p38 kinase may 
be involved in the activation and binding of IRF-1 or related proteins to the
ISRE motif. Changes in ISRE activation levels in cultured hepatocytes may have
important implications in primary hepatocyte differentiation and loss of
function.

expression, and undergo apoptosis when cultured in the presence of NO-donor
compounds (sodium nitroprusside and NOC12) for 48 h. At 72 h, cells that evade
apoptosis start to proliferate again, overexpress both chains of the IFN-gammaR, 
and thus become susceptible to apoptosis in the presence of IFN-gamma. By
contrast, in the presence of IFN-gamma, no apoptosis, but an increase of
proliferation was displayed by control cultures of T cells not exposed to NO and 
not overexpressing IFN-gammaR chains. The NO-induced cell surface overexpression 
of IFN-gammaR chains did not affect the transduction of IFN-gamma-mediated
signals, as shown by the expression of the transcription factor IFN regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1). However, transduction of these signals was quantitatively
modified, because IFN-gamma induces enhanced levels of caspase-1 effector death
in NO-treated cells. These findings identify NO as one of the environmental
factors that critically govern the response of T cells to IFN-gamma. By inducing 
the overexpression of IFN-gammaR chains, NO decides whether IFN-gamma promotes
cell proliferation or the induction of apoptosis.

Differential selectivity of CIITA promoter activation by IFN-gamma and IRF-1 in
astrocytes and macrophages: CIITA promoter activation is not affected by
TNF-alpha.

During demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), locally
elevated cytokine levels may induce upregulation of MHC class II molecules on
otherwise low expressing or negative cell types such as microglia and astrocytes,
since IFN-gamma has been shown to induce MHC class II expression on these cell
types in vitro. While many transcription factors are involved with MHC class II
expression, only the class II transactivator (CIITA) is tightly coordinated with 
IFN-gamma-inducibility. Control of CIITA gene expression is complex, involving
four distinct promoters, two of which (promoters III and IV) are
IFN-gamma-inducible in certain cell types. Here we demonstrate that IFN-gamma
treatment of rat astrocytes induces only CIITA promoter IV activity in contrast
to the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 that uses both IFN-gamma-inducible
promoters. In contrast to previously published reports, promoter IV activation is
completely dependent upon an intact interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) but
not STAT binding site using promoter constructs specifically mutated at these
positions. Importantly, while TNF-alpha is able to synergize with IFN-gamma to
increase astrocyte MHC class II expression in vitro, we show that treatment of
rat astrocytes with TNF-alpha has no effect on CIITA promoter activity. These
data demonstrate that TNF-alpha augments MHC class II expression through a
mechanism downstream or independent of CIITA induction.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) has been recognized as an important tumor 
suppressor and growth regulatory transcription factor, which is also involved in 
cell differentiation. In this study we investigated the role of IRF-1 in phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation of
human monoblastic U937 cells. For this purpose U937 cells were stably transfected
with a vector overexpressing IRF-1 antisense mRNA (U937 IRF-1A cells) and with
the SV-40 empty vector (U937-SV40 e.v. cells). We report here that U937 and
U937-SV40 e.v. cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells upon PMA
stimulation and showed IRF-1 up-regulation. On the contrary, U937 IRF-1A cells
stimulated with PMA kept an undifferentiated phenotype and proliferated actively.
A direct correlation between induction of IRF-1 and up-regulation of IRF-1 gene
targets such as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and WAF-1/CIP-1 was also observed
in U937 cells. On the other hand U937 IRF-1A cells down-regulated ODC and did not
express WAF-1. Results show that IRF-1 plays a pivotal role in PMA-induced
monocyte/macrophage differentiation.

Upregulation of CD38 gene expression in leukemic B cells by interferon types I
and II.

The activation antigen CD38, which has NAD+ glycohydrolase activity in its
extracellular domain, is expressed by a large variety of cell types. Few
investigations into the regulation of CD38 expression by physiologic stimuli have
been reported. As the CD38 promoter contains potential binding sites for
interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), we investigated the influence of
IFN type I (alpha and beta) and type II (gamma) on CD38 gene expression of
leukemic B cells. Using the IFN-responsive B cell line Eskol, we found by RT-PCR 
analysis a rapid time-dependent induction in CD38 mRNA (starting at 6 h) with
each type of IFN. This induction was independent of protein synthesis, suggesting
that CD38 gene activation does not require IRF-1 but is merely under direct
transcriptional regulation by latent IFN-inducible factors. mRNA stimulation was 
followed within 24 h by induction of membrane CD38, which coincided with rises of
CD38-specific ectoenzymatic activities, that is, NAD+ glycohydrolase,
(A/G)DP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase activities. IFN failed
to induce or upregulate the other CD38-related ectoenzymes analyzed, that is,
CD39, CD73, CD157, and PC-1. Similarly, treatment of leukemic cells of patients
with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with IFN resulted in an increase in
CD38 mRNA mirrored by plasma membrane upregulation of CD38 and NAD+
glycohydrolase activity. Further investigation in relation to CD38 gene
activation and B-CLL behavior remains to be defined.

Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor,
involved in cell growth regulation, pathogen response and immune activation. To
identify novel gene targets that may contribute to IRF-1 mediated activities, RNA
fingerprinting was performed using NIH3T3 cells that inducibly express a hybrid
form of IRF-1 under tetracycline regulated control. Secretory leukocyte protease 
inhibitor (SLPI) - a regulator of inflammation and an inhibitor of the LPS
response - was identified as a gene repressed after doxycycline induced IRF-1
expression. Preliminary analysis of the human SLPI promoter identified an
ISRE-like site located within the -221 to -200 region to which IRF-1 binds and a 
second, putative IRF-1 binding site upstream of the TATA box. Furthermore,
co-transfection studies demonstrated that SLPI expression was inhibited by IRF-1 
co-expression. The identification of SLPI as a target of IRF-1 regulation reveals
a unique involvement of IRF-1 in repression of gene transcription and assigns a
novel role for IRF-1 in inflammation.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 and -2 expression in human melanoma specimens.

Lowney JK(1), Boucher LD, Swanson PE, Doherty GM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

BACKGROUND: Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 are nuclear
transcription factors that respond to interferon-gamma. IRF-1 acts as the
effector arm of the interferon-gamma response in tumor cells, whereas IRF-2 binds
to the same DNA consensus sequence and opposes IRF-1 activity. This effect is
intact in human and murine tumor models, including melanomas; previous work in
our laboratory demonstrated the tumor-suppressing activity of IRF-1 expression in
in vivo models and the opposing effect of IRF-2. The expression of IRF-1 and -2
in human solid tumors had not been previously investigated.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, archival tissue specimens from 38
human melanomas were obtained and stained with polyclonal anti-IRF-1 and
anti-IRF-2 antibodies, using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique with
epitope retrieval.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine specimens showed granular cytoplasmic staining with the
anti-IRF-1 or anti-IRF-2 antibodies. IRF-1 staining was correlated with less
advanced disease. Superficial spreading and in situ lesions exhibited more
frequent IRF-1 staining, compared with nodular or metastatic disease. Only more
advanced lesions showed neither IRF-1 nor IRF-2 staining.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical staining of archival tissue identified IRF-1 and
-2 in human melanomas; this had not been previously demonstrated. IRF-1 staining 
was correlated with the morphologic characteristics of less advanced disease.
Tumor-suppressing effects of IRF-1 may account for the less aggressive biologic
features of IRF-1-expressing melanomas, as we would predict from the experimental
data.

IFN-alpha activates Stat6 and leads to the formation of Stat2:Stat6 complexes in 
B cells.

Gupta S(1), Jiang M, Pernis AB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York 10032, USA.

IFN-alpha consists of a family of highly homologous proteins, which exert
pleiotropic effects on a wide variety of cell types. The biologic activities of
IFN-alpha are mediated by its binding to a multicomponent receptor complex
resulting in the activation of the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway. In most
cell types, activation of Stat1 and Stat2 by IFN-alpha leads to the formation of 
either STAT homo-/heterodimers or of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex
composed of Stat1, Stat2, and p48, a non-STAT protein. These distinct
transcriptional complexes then target two different sets of cis-elements,
gamma-activated sites and IFN-stimulated response elements. Here, we report that 
IFN-alpha can activate complexes containing Stat6, which, until now, has been
primarily associated with signaling by two cytokines with biologic overlap, IL-4 
and IL-13. Induction of Stat6 complexes by IFN-alpha appears to be cell type
specific, given that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 in response to IFN-alpha
is predominantly detected in B cells. Activation of Stat6 by IFN-alpha in B cells
is accompanied by the formation of novel Stat2:Stat6 complexes, including an
IFN-stimulated gene factor 3-like complex containing Stat2, Stat6, and p48. B
cell lines resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha display a
decrease in the IFN-alpha-mediated activation of Stat6. Activation of Stat6 as
well as of Stat2:Stat6 complexes by IFN-alpha in B cells may allow modulation of 
target genes in a cell type-specific manner.

The role of interferon regulatory factor-1 in cytokine-induced mRNA expression
and cell death in murine pancreatic beta-cells.

Combinations of cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), induce nitric oxide (NO) production and cell death 
in pancreatic islet cells. We have previously shown that these events are
preceded by increased expression of the transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We utilized an IRF-1 knockout mouse (IRF-1-/-) to
investigate the role of IRF-1 in cytokine-induced islet- and beta-cell gene
expression and cell death. For this purpose, pancreatic islets or FACS-purified
beta-cells were isolated from wild type (wt) or IRF-1-/- mice. These cells were
exposed for different time points to IL-1beta (50 U/mI), IFN-gamma (1,000 U/ml)
and/or TNF-alpha (1,000 U/ml) before being harvested for determination of
viability (by nuclear dyes) and mRNA expression (by RT-PCR with specific
primers). Following a 24 hours exposure to IL-1beta or IL-1beta + IFN-gamma,
pancreatic islets isolated from IRF-1-/- mice presented a 30-50% reduction in
medium nitrite accumulation and inducible NO-synthase (iNOS) expression.
Interestingly, both wt and IRF-1-/- purified beta-cells failed to produce NO in
response to IL-1beta alone, but presented a similar increase in nitrite
accumulation and iNOS expression following exposure to IL-1beta + IFN-gamma. The 
basal expression of MHC class I mRNA was lower in IRF-1-/- islet cells (30%
reduction), but there was a similar 2-4 fold-increase in MHC expression in islet 
cells from both strains following cytokine exposure. IL-1beta induced serine
protease inhibitor-3 (SPI-3; a putative cellular "defense" protein) mRNA
expression in both wt and IRF-1-/- islets or beta-cells. IFN-gamma decreased the 
IL-1beta-induced SPI-3 expression in wt islets or beta-cells, but induced a
5-fold increase in the expression of this mRNA in IRF-1-/- islets cells,
suggesting that IRF-1 mediates an inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on SPI-3
expression. Treatment of whole islets for 3 days with IL-1beta + IFN-gamma
induced significantly more islet cell death in wt than in IRF-1-/- mice
(respectively 85 +/- 3% versus 31 +/- 4% dead cells). On the other hand,
prolonged exposure (3-9 days) of FACS-purified beta-cells to the same cytokines, 
or a combination of 3 cytokines, led to a similar increase in cell death in both 
IRF-1-/- and wt islets. In conclusion, IRF-1 contributes to cytokine-induced
islet iNOS expression and cell death. These effects are absent in purified
beta-cells, suggesting that IRF-1 may mediate its effects on whole islets via
activation of non-endocrine cells (e.g. macrophages and ductal cells) present in 
these preparations.

Salicylate-enhanced activation of transcription factors induced by
interferon-gamma.

Chen LC(1), Kepka-Lenhart D, Wright TM, Morris SM Jr.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.

Salicylate enhanced the interferon-gamma-dependent activation of two
transcription factors in a murine macrophage cell line: signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT)1 and interferon-gamma-responsive factor 1.
Salicylate alone did not activate these transcription factors. This enhancement
was reflected by increased DNA-binding activities and was the consequence of
prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of these transcription factors following
interferon-gamma treatment. However, salicylate did not directly inhibit
protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in nuclear extracts of
interferon-gamma-treated cells. The enhanced activation of STAT1 resulted in
increased induction of mRNA encoding interferon regulatory factor-1. These
results not only demonstrate that aspirin and its metabolite salicylate may have 
pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory effects but also raise the
possibility that new cellular targets may be identified for modulating the Janus 
kinase-STAT signalling pathway.

Effects of oral administration of interferon-alpha on antibody production in mice
with induced tolerance.

In vivo systemic effects and the immunomodulating potential of the oral
administration of murine interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) were investigated through
mRNA expression of both IFN-alpha-inducible factors, interferon regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1) and 2,5-adenylate synthetase [2-5(A) synthetase] and 2-5(A)
synthetase enzymatic activity in spleen and antibody production. The daily
administration of IFN-alpha (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 IU/body) for 1 week augmented
IRF-1 and 2-5(A) synthetase mRNA expression levels, as well as 2-5(A) synthetase 
enzymatic activity in spleen cells but not in cervical lymph nodes. The in vivo
immunomodulating potential of the oral administration of IFN-alpha was also
evaluated through antibody production in mice with induced tolerance. Ovalbumin
(OVA) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to induce systemic antibody
production on day 0 when OVA feeding was initiated. The OVA was fed every 2-3
days for a total of 14 doses to suppress serum antibody levels. Oral
administration of murine IFN-alpha was initiated on day 0 and was continued for 5
consecutive days weekly for 5 weeks (24 doses). On every sampling date (days 10, 
17, 24, and 32), specific antibody levels in the IFN-alpha-administered groups
were significantly higher than those in the control (nonadministered) group. This
was especially noted in early phases (days 10 and 17) of antibody production when
the levels of antibody in serum from the IFN-alpha-administration groups were
equivalent to those of the nontolerance group. Altogether, it is suggested that
oral use of IFN-alpha can elicit immunomodulating actions (e.g., antibody levels)
by affecting the systemic immune system(s).

Evidence for IRF-1-dependent gene expression deficiency in interferon
unresponsive HepG2 cells.

Montpellier II, Place E. Bataillon, Case 107, 34095, Montpellier Cédex 5, France.

Induction of the antiproliferative and antiviral state by IFNs (type I and II) is
dramatically impaired in HepG2 cells. We show here that RNase L, IDO, GBP-2 and
iNOS genes normally expressed as a secondary response to IFN are no longer
inducible in HepG2 cells, while induction of primary response genes (IRF-1, PKR, 
p48-ISGF3gamma, 2-5AS, 6-16 and p56-(trp)tRNA) are unaffected. On the basis of
previous data implicating transcription factor IRF-1 in the induction of some
IFN-induced genes, we tested the effects of transfecting an IRF-1 oligonucleotide
antisense in HeLa cells and found specifically impaired IFN induction of
secondary response genes (RNase L, IDO and GBP-2). This raised the possibility
that IRF-1 was defective in HepG2 cells. However, some molecular and biochemical 
analyses reveal that IRF-1 is induced normally by IFNs and retains its normal
size, cellular location, phosphorylation status and ability to bind the IDO
promoter in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that although the primary response
pathway is fully functional, some aspects of the secondary pathway involving
IRF-1 (but not IRF-1 itself) are defective in HepG2 cells. It may be possible
that the promoter region of these deficient HepG2-genes requires an unidentified 
transcription factor in addition to de novo IRF-1, which could be elicited by a
cooperative activator.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase deficiency in macrophages inhibits nitric oxide
generation leading to enhancement of IL-12 induction.

Mukhopadhyay S(1), George A, Bal V, Ravindran B, Rath S.

Author information: 
(1)National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.

We show that macrophages of X-linked immunodeficient mice with a mutant
nonfunctional Bruton's tyrosine kinase produce less NO than wild-type macrophages
in response to a variety of stimuli. Induction of the inducible NO synthase
(iNOS) protein, the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 involved in iNOS
expression, and the transcription factor STAT-1 involved in regulating IFN
regulatory factor-1 induction are all poorer in X-linked immunodeficient than in 
wild-type macrophages. On the other hand, induction of IL-12 is higher in
X-linked immunodeficient than in wild-type macrophages. Macrophage IL-12
induction is enhanced by iNOS inhibitors such as aminoguanidine and
thiocitrulline and is inhibited by NO generation via sodium nitroprusside. There 
is relative enhancement of IFN-gamma production by immune T cells from mice
immunized under aminoguanidine cover. Our data thus suggest that Bruton's
tyrosine kinase participates in signaling for iNOS induction via IFN regulatory
factor-1 in macrophages and that NO is an inhibitor of IL-12 induction.

Functional analysis of human herpesvirus 8-encoded viral interferon regulatory
factor 1 and its association with cellular interferon regulatory factors and

Human herpesvirus 8/Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (HHV-8/KSHV) contains, in
addition to genes required for viral replication, a unique set of nonstructural
genes which may be part of viral mimicry and contribute to viral replication and 
pathogenesis in vivo. Among these, HHV-8 encodes four open reading frames (ORFs) 
that showed homology to the transcription factors of the interferon regulatory
factor (IRF) family. The ORF K9, viral IRF 1 (vIRF-1), has been cloned, and it
was shown that, when overexpressed, it down modulates the interferon-mediated
transcriptional activation of the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15)
promoter, and the role of vIRF-1 in viral mimicry was implied. However, the
molecular mechanism of this effect has not been clarified. Here, we extend this
observation and show that vIRF-1 also downregulates the transcriptional activity 
of IFNA gene promoter in infected cells by interfering with the transactivating
activity of cellular IRFs, including IRF-1 and IRF-3. We further show that
ectopic expression of vIRF-1 in NIH 3T3 cells confers resistance to tumor
necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis. While vIRF-1 is unable to bind DNA with 
the same specificity as cellular IRFs, we demonstrate by in vitro binding assay
that it can associate with the family of cellular IRFs, such as IRF-1 and the
interferon consensus sequence binding protein. vIRF-1 interaction domain was
localized between amino acids (aa) 152 and 243. While no binding between the
full-size IRF-3 and vIRF-1 could be detected by the same assay, we show that
vIRF-1 also targets the carboxy-terminal region (aa 1623 to 2414) of the
transcriptional coactivator p300 which could also bind IRF-3 and IRF-1. These
results demonstrate that vIRF-1 can modulate the transcription of the IFNA genes 
by direct heterodimerization with members of the IRF family, as well as by
competitive binding with cellular transcription factors to the carboxy-terminal
region of p300.

Retinoic acid resistance in NB4 APL cells is associated with lack of interferon
alpha synthesis Stat1 and p48 induction.

Pelicano L(1), Brumpt C, Pitha PM, Chelbi-Alix MK.

Author information: 
(1)CNRS, UPR 9051, Hôpital St. Louis, Paris, France.

In the t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), all trans-retinoic (RA)
treatment induces maturation leading to clinically complete but not durable
remission, as RA resistance develops in the treated patients as well as in vitro.
RA and interferons (IFNs) are known inhibitors of proliferation in various cells 
including those from APL. In this report, we show that they can act cooperatively
to inhibit growth and to induce differentiation of NB4 cells but not of two
RA-resistant NB4 derived cell lines, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2. However, the resistant
cell lines respond to IFN. In NB4 cells, RA increases the expression of Stat1,
p48 and IRF-1, three transcription factors playing a central role in the IFN
response and induces the synthesis and the secretion of IFN alpha. RA-induced IFN
alpha seems to play a role in inhibition of NB4 cell growth but not in their
differentiation. In the resistant cells, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2, both the induction of
IFN and the increase of Statl and p48 expression by RA are completely blocked. In
contrast, IRF-1 mRNA and protein expressions are induced in the three cell lines.
This suggests that increase of IRF-1 expression is not sufficient for IFN
induction. Our results identify some defects linked to RA-resistance in APL and
support the hypothesis that RA-induced Stat1 expression and IFN secretion may be 
one of the mechanisms mediating growth inhibition by RA.

Conserved transactivation domain shared by interferon regulatory factors and Smad
morphogens.

Eroshkin A(1), Mushegian A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Computational Sciences, Axys Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA
92037, USA.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) regulate the transcription of both
interferon-inducible genes and interferons themselves. Along with the N-terminal,
DNA-binding, winged-helix domain, most IRFs contain the C-terminal domains that
are shown to be related to the C-terminal domains in the proteins of the Smad
family that mediate transcription activation in the transforming growth factor
response pathway. Comparison of the IRF-Smad alignment to the known
three-dimensional structure of human tumor suppressor Smad4 suggests that a
conserved loop, equivalent to Loop 3 in Smad 4, is a determinant of
protein-protein interaction in IRFs.

IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene-disrupted mice are defective in IL-12 and
IL-18 gene expression at the transcriptional and post-translational level
respectively. The mutant mouse mounts a type 2 T cell response upon bacterial
infection because of the impaired induction of the IL-12 p40 gene and
IFN-gamma-producing type 1 T cells are not induced. We showed here, however, that
different pathogens activate a novel pathway for inducing IFN-gamma-producing
type 1 T cells even in an IRF-1-deficient mouse. This pathway is independent of
IL-12 and IL-18, and is mediated by a distinct function of macrophage lineage
cells. Macrophages of the mutant mice fail to activate the IL-12-dependent
pathway, but they function in the IL-12-independent pathway in
Plasmodium-infected mice. This leads to the hypothesis that the IL-12-independent
novel pathway for inducing IFN-gamma-producing T cells is distinct from the
classical type 1/type 2 T cell subset differentiation pathway.

Macrophages derived from IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 knockout (-/-)
and wild-type (+/+) mice were utilized to examine the role of these transcription
factors in the regulation of IL-12 mRNA and protein expression. Induction of
IL-12 p40 mRNA by LPS was markedly diminished in both IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-)
macrophages. In contrast, IRF-1(-/-), but not IRF-2(-/-), macrophages exhibited
impaired LPS-induced IL-12 p35 mRNA expression. The ability of IFN-gamma to
augment LPS-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA further when both stimuli were present
simultaneously was significantly diminished in both IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-)
macrophages, with the most profound impairment observed for IRF-1(-/-)
macrophages. Reductions in IL-12 mRNA expression after stimulation with LPS or
LPS plus IFN-gamma were accompanied by substantial reductions in IL-12 p40 and
IL-12 p70 protein in both IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-) macrophages. Priming
IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-) macrophages with IFN-gamma for 24 h before LPS
treatment partially restored impaired IL-12 mRNA and protein production in both
IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-) macrophages. Depressed IL-12 levels were paralleled by 
significant reductions in IFN-gamma mRNA expression in IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-) 
macrophages. These results indicate that both IRF-1 and IRF-2 are critical
transcription factors in the regulation of macrophage IL-12 and consequently
IFN-gamma production.

The induction kinetics of the mRNA of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1),
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and proinflammatory cytokines in
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected human type 2 alveolar epithelial cells
(A549 cells) were analyzed semiquantitatively by RT-PCR. RSV enhanced IRF-1 and
iNOS mRNA expression as early as 4 h after RSV infection and this enhancement
lasted several hours. No IFN-gamma gene expression was observed during the whole 
course of the infection. Expression of IFN-beta, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha genes
was observed slightly at 4 h and became marked 7 h after infection. Addition of
neutralizing antibodies to these cytokines to the culture had no effect on the
induction of iNOS mRNA. The iNOS transcriptional activity in RSV-infected cells
was significantly enhanced by an exogenous cytokine mixture (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha,
and IFN-gamma). An apparent nitric oxide (NO) production was identified only when
cytokines were added together with RSV infection. A significant increase of iNOS 
gene expression was observed in nasopharyngeal exudate cells obtained from
infants during the acute phase of RSV bronchiolitis. These observations suggest
that RSV infection of human respiratory epithelial cells induces the iNOS gene
both in vitro and in vivo; this induction may occur rather promptly and involves 
transcriptional activator IRF-1 induced by the RSV infection itself. The iNOS
gene, which is initially induced by RSV infection, may be further enhanced in a
paracrine fashion by proinflammatory cytokines released by infection-activated
inflammatory cells.

Cloning of interferon-stimulated gene 17: the promoter and nuclear proteins that 
regulate transcription.

A member of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) family encodes a 17-kDa
ubiquitin homolog called ISG17 that is induced in the bovine uterine endometrium 
by interferon-tau (IFN-tau) during early pregnancy. The bovine (b) ISG17 cDNA
shares 30% identity with a tandem ubiquitin repeat and 70% identity with human
(h) ISG15. The present experiments were designed to sequence the bISG17 gene,
compare general structure with the hISG15 gene, and to identify transcription
factors that were induced by IFN-tau in bovine endometrial (BEND) cells. The
promoter of the bISG17 gene was similar to the hISG15 gene in placement of a
tandem IFN-stimulatory response element (ISRE) at position -90, but unique in the
presence of three additional ISREs at positions -123, -332, and -525. IFN-tau (25
nM) induced nuclear proteins in BEND cells that interacted with a tandem bISG17
ISRE in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). IFN-regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) bound to this ISRE based upon supershift EMSA using antiserum against
IRF-1. IFN-tau activated STAT-1 (signal transducer and activator of
transcription-1) and -2 by 0.5 h, and IRF-1 by 2 h in BEND cells. It is concluded
that the bISG17 gene is similar to the hISG15 gene, retains an ISRE that
interacts with IRF-1, and is possibly induced initially by the STATs and later by
IRF-1 in response to IFN-tau during early pregnancy.

Induction of transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 by
interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in
FRTL-5 cells.

While it is well known that interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF alpha) play a role in the regulation of thyroid growth and
differentiated functions, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in
mediating the effects of IFN gamma and TNF alpha on thyroid function are unknown.
In the present study, we used FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells to examine the effects of 
IFN gamma and TNF alpha on gene expression of transcription factor interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which is involved in mediating the effects of these 
cytokines in a number of cell types. Northern blot analysis of FRTL-5 mRNA showed
a single IRF-1 mRNA at 2.2 Kb. In quiescent FRTL-5 cells, IRF-1 mRNA levels were 
low but detectable by Northern analysis. Incubation of FRTL-5 cells with IFN
gamma or TNF alpha resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in IRF-1 mRNA 
levels. We have shown that TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma act synergistically to block
the TSH-induced increase in type I 5'-deiodinase(5'D-I) activity and 5'D-I gene
expression in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. Incubation of FRTL-5 cells with IFN gamma
and TNF alpha in combination, however, did not synergistically increase IRF-1
mRNA levels. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that IFN gamma 
induced the formation of a single complex to a IFN gamma activation site (GAS)
probe in a dose dependent manner. Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF
alpha activates transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B) through 
activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to
ceramide in a number of cell types. Here we demonstrate that hydrolysis of
sphingomyelin to ceramide by sphingomyelinase (SMase), but not activation of PKC 
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), was involved in the activation of 
NF kappa B in FRTL-5 cells. Similarly, hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide,
but not activation of PKC, resulted in an increased in IRF-1 mRNA levels in
FRTL-5 cells. The present data demonstrate that IFN gamma and TNF alpha increase 
IRF-1 mRNA levels in FRTL-5 cells through activation of GAS and NF kappa B
binding proteins, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that upregulation of
IRF-1 may play a role in mediating the effects of IFN gamma and TNF alpha on
thyroid function. Our results also suggest that the induction of IRF-1 mRNA by
IFN gamma and TNF alpha is not the cellular mechanism involved in the synergistic
effect of these cytokines on thyroid function.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 tryptophan 11 to arginine point mutation abolishes
DNA binding.

College of Medicine, MDC 7, 12901 Bruce B. Downs Blvd., Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator of genes
induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. Defects in IRF-1 occur
frequently in human cancers and may contribute to tumorigenesis. The IRF family
of transcription factors share invariant tryptophan residues that have been
proposed to function by orienting the DNA contacting residues of IRF-1 with the
DNA core sequence of the IRF element. Here we describe a point mutation in IRF-1 
that converts the tryptophan at codon 11 to arginine (W11R). The IRF-1 (W11R)
mutation abolishes IRF-1 DNA binding and transactivating activities demonstrating
the critical role of this invariant tryptophan in IRF-1 function.

Cooperative activity between HER oncogenes and the tumor suppressor IRF-1 results
in apoptosis.

Kirchhoff S(1), Hauser H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gene Regulation and Differentiation, GBF-National Research
Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany.

The tumor suppressor transcription factor IRF-1 inhibits cell growth. In this
report we show that IRF-1 also induces apoptosis of highly transformed and
tumorigenic cell lines. This activity of IRF-1 is demonstrated with cell lines
expressing HER oncogenes and an activatable IRF-1 fusion protein. Growth of cell 
lines expressing inactive HER1 is inhibited on IRF-1 activation. In contrast, the
same cells are killed by apoptosis when HER1 and IRF-1 are activated
simultaneously. We identified promoters stimulated synergistically by IRF-1 and
by activated HER1. To determine the signals causing transcriptional synergism
and/or apoptosis we tried to modulate these effects by various dominant negative 
acting proteins. Dominant negative STAT5alpha abolished both induction of
apoptosis and transcriptional synergy of IRF-1 and HER. Thus, these results
provide new insights into the mechanism of oncogene-dependent apoptosis induced
by the activation of a tumor suppressor.

Epigenetic inhibition of lysyl oxidase transcription after transformation by ras 
oncogene.

Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular enzyme involved in connective tissue maturation
that also acts as a phenotypic suppressor of the ras oncogene. To understand how 
this suppressor is controlled, gene transcription was studied and the promoter
was characterized. Nuclear runoff transcription assays indicated that the
markedly reduced amounts of lysyl oxidase message detected after ras
transformation resulted from inhibition of lysyl oxidase transcription.
Interferon-mediated phenotypic reversion of ras transformed cells, in which the
ras oncogene continued to be expressed, was accompanied by the restoration of
lysyl oxidase transcription. Reporter gene assay of a transfected mouse lysyl
oxidase promoter indicated that it was active in the transformed background,
despite the silencing of the endogenous lysyl oxidase promoter. The detection of 
comparable amounts of mRNA for transcription factors IRF-1 and IRF-2 in normal
and ras-transformed cell lines suggests that the differential transcription of
lysyl oxidase was not due to regulation of IRFs. Lysyl oxidase promoter activity 
was localized to a 126 bp region that includes two consensus TATA boxes with
associated confirmed cap signals. Analysis of a human lysyl oxidase promoter
sequence indicated similar promoter elements and extensive sequence identity with
the mouse promoter. The binding of transcription factor AP2 to sites predicted in
the control region was confirmed by DNase footprinting. Lysyl oxidase
transcription was stimulated by dexamethasone treatment of cells, but this effect
could not be assigned within the approximately 3 kb region tested in reporter
gene constructs. The promoter activity of the lysyl oxidase reporter gene
construct was completely abolished by in vitro DNA methylation, suggesting that
the transcriptional suppression after transformation by the ras oncogene may
involve DNA methylation.

universitaire, Lille.

The immune response against viral pathogens include specific and non specific
mechanisms. Cytokines are peptides which can play a role in the non specific
immunity. Type I interferons (IFNalpha/beta) are the most effective antiviral
cytokines. Interferons alpha are represented by a large familly of structurally
related genes while the IFNbeta is encoded by a single gene. Type I interferon
genes are located on the chromosome 9, and are segregated in a "modern" and an
"ancestral" group with distinctive effects onto the cells. Type I interferons
consist of 5 alpha helices, 4 of which are closely held together. Type I
interferons receptor is a member of the class II cytokine receptor familly. It is
a heterodimer composed of polypeptidic chains naimed IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. The
type I interferons inducers are viruses, inactivated viruses and certain
synthetic molecules. The molecular mechanisms of the induction of IFNbeta have
been extensively described whereas the factors that play a role in the regulation
of IFNalpha are not so well characterized. Two regulating domains located on the 
IFNbeta gene promotor are involved. The activation of these regulating domains
leads to adverse effects by interacting with two intracellular factors (IRF1 and 
IRF2). IRF1 enhances the synthesis of IFNbeta but other pathways may be involved 
as well. The different IFNalpha sub-types have not only synergistic but also
antagonistic effects. The synthesis of the different subtypes depends on cell
lines and IFNalpha inducers. The N terminal part of IFNalpha is a major
determinant in the diversity of the biological effects of IFNalpha sub-types
which probably involve changes of the conformation of the type I receptor
resulting from interactions between the receptor and its ligand. The type I
interferons confer resistance to viruses, especially by enhancing the synthesis
of intracellular antiviral proteins.

Chlamydia inhibits interferon gamma-inducible major histocompatibility complex
class II expression by degradation of upstream stimulatory factor 1.

Zhong G(1), Fan T, Liu L.

We report that chlamydiae, which are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens, 
can inhibit interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II expression. However, the IFN-gamma-induced IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression is not
affected, suggesting that chlamydia may selectively target the IFN-gamma
signaling pathways required for MHC class II expression. Chlamydial inhibition of
MHC class II expression is correlated with degradation of upstream stimulatory
factor (USF)-1, a constitutively and ubiquitously expressed transcription factor 
required for IFN-gamma induction of class II transactivator (CIITA) but not of
IRF-1 and ICAM-1. CIITA is an obligate mediator of IFN-gamma-inducible MHC class 
II expression. Thus, diminished CIITA expression as a result of USF-1 degradation
may account for the suppression of the IFN-gamma-inducible MHC class II in
chlamydia-infected cells. These results reveal a novel immune evasion strategy
used by the intracellular bacterial pathogen chlamydia that improves our
understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis.

Cytotoxic response of ovarian cancer cell lines to IFN-gamma is associated with
sustained induction of IRF-1 and p21 mRNA.

Burke F(1), Smith PD, Crompton MR, Upton C, Balkwill FR.

Author information: 
(1)Biological Therapies Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has some anti-tumour activity in human ovarian
cancer. This cytokine inhibited proliferation in three of four ovarian cancer
cell lines in vitro. We then compared the action of IFN-gamma in two cell lines, 
one sensitive and one resistant to its growth inhibitory effects. IFN-gamma
signalling appeared normal in both cell lines, with stat1 DNA binding activity
detectable at 30 min. Continuous exposure to IFN-gamma for 2-3 days was necessary
for an irreversible effect on cell growth and apoptosis in cells sensitive to
growth inhibition. During this time there was an increase in mRNA for the CKI
p21, but no alterations in mRNA levels for other members of the CKI family.
Maintenance of p21 mRNA required continuous mRNA synthesis. mRNA for the
transcription factor IRF-1 was also induced in growth inhibited cells with
similar kinetics to those observed for p21. Maximal induction of both p21 and
IRF-1 mRNA was observed after 2-3 days IFN-gamma exposure as the cells became
committed to cell death. There was also a rapid increase in p21 and IRF-1 mRNA in
cells resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma, but this increase 
was not maintained. Thus, continuous interaction with the IFN-gamma receptor,
together with a sustained induction of p21 and IRF-1, is associated with growth
inhibitory and apoptotic effects of IFN-gamma in ovarian cancer cells.

Interferon regulatory transcription factors are constitutively expressed and

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors
involved in regulation of cell growth and immunological responses. Nine IRFs have
been described and they are expressed in a variety of cells, except for ICSBP and
LSIRF/Pip, which are thought to be expressed exclusively in immune cells. Here,
we show that IRF-1, IRF-2, ICSBP, and LSIRF/Pip are constitutively expressed in
the mouse lens. These IRFs are present in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of
lens cells. However, the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins exhibit distinct
mobilities on SDS/PAGE. We further show that in the developing mouse lens, IRF-1 
and IRF-2 are expressed at high levels in differentiated lens fiber cells with
very low and barely detectable levels in undifferentiated lens epithelial cells. 
Although the level of ICSBP expression is very low in the normal mouse lens, in
transgenic mice with constitutive expression of interferon gamma in the lens, its
level is markedly elevated and ICSBP expression is detected exclusively in the
nuclei of undifferentiated lens cells. Taken together, our data suggest that
expression of IRF transcription factors is spatially regulated in the lens and
that distinct IRFs may contribute to differential gene regulation in the
epithelial and fiber compartments of the vertebrate lens.

Expression of interferon regulatory factors and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in
Chlamydia trachomatis-infected synovial fibroblasts.

Synovial fibroblasts probably represent host cells for Chlamydia trachomatis
during initial intra-articular infection in reactive arthritis. In vitro synovial
cells produce interferon-beta (IFN-beta) in response to chlamydial infection.
IFN-beta expression can be activated by interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
and interferon-stimulated gene factor 3gamma (ISGF3gamma). In this study, we
demonstrate that infection of synovial fibroblasts with C. trachomatis serotype D
induced the expression of IRF-1 mRNA as shown by reverse transcription-PCR. Tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation enhanced IRF-1 mRNA levels in
infected cells and was required to detect IRF-1 protein by immunoblotting. The
level of constitutively expressed IRF-2 was not significantly affected after
infection. C. trachomatis was found to cause an up-regulation of ISGF3gamma
protein in synovial cells. Induction of the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an important mechanism of the host cell
response to control intracellular infection by chlamydiae. It has been described 
that IRF-1 can induce IDO gene expression. Infection of synovial fibroblasts
alone in the absence of exogenous cytokine induced the expression of IDO mRNA
which was enhanced by TNF-alpha treatment. The stimulation of IRF-1, ISGF3gamma, 
and IDO expression was most effective when viable chlamydiae were used as
inoculum. Neutralization of IFN-beta in the culture medium of infected cells
diminished but did not abrogate expression of IRF-1, ISGF3gamma, and IDO. The
increased production of IRF-1 and ISGF3gamma in C. trachomatis-infected synovial 
fibroblasts may contribute to induction of IFN-beta and IDO.

To investigate mechanisms of interferon (IFN) resistance, we have established an 
IFN-resistant Daudi subline (Daudi(res)), which is 1 X 10(4) times more resistant
to IFN-alpha than parental cells. Among the IFN-inducible genes examined, only
ICE mRNA expression was deficient in Daudi(res) cells. We then analyzed the
regulatory mechanisms of ICE transcription, and found that IFN-induced activation
of the ICE promoter was dependent on the binding of IRFs to its initiator (Inr)
element. Inr binding of IRFs was markedly diminished in Daudi(res) cells, and
forced expression of IRF-1 was able to activate the ICE promoter to the level of 
parental cells. These results suggest that IRFs and their target genes, as
represented by ICE in this study, are involved in IFN resistance.

Regulation of IFN consensus sequence binding protein expression in murine

Recent work has demonstrated that the transcription factor, IFN consensus
sequence binding protein (ICSBP), plays a critical role in the capacity of mice
to control infection with Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania major, agents that
require highly activated macrophages for their elimination. In this report the
regulation of ICSBP mRNA and protein were analyzed in murine macrophages
stimulated with LPS and/or IFN-gamma. Like induction of leishmaniacidal activity,
LPS and IFN-gamma synergize to induce ICSBP mRNA and protein. Deletion analysis
of the ICSBP promoter identified regions that were IFN-gamma responsive, regions 
that mediate the ability of LPS and IFN-gamma to activate this promoter
synergistically, as well as regions that normally repress ICSBP transcription.
Finally, exogenous expression of ICSBP, found in previous studies to
down-regulate MHC I gene expression, failed to repress basal or IFN-gamma-induced
ICSBP transcription. This demonstrates that ICSBP can selectively suppress the
expression of IFN-responsive genes. These findings extend in a significant way
our understanding of the regulation of ICSBP by LPS and IFN-gamma and provide
important clues as to its role in macrophage activation.

IL-12 induces IFN regulating factor-1 (IRF-1) gene expression in human NK and T
cells.

(1)Lymphocyte Cell Biology Section, Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch, National
Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

IL-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immune 
responses and the differentiation of naive CD4+ cells to Th1 cells; however,
relatively few IL-12 target genes have been identified. To better clarify the
molecular basis of IL-12 action, we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by
IL-12, first by contrasting IL-12- and IFN-alpha-inducible genes. We identified
several genes up-regulated by IL-12, namely, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-1RA, and
IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 is a transcription factor regulated by
IFNs that is also essential for Th1 responses. We demonstrated that IL-12
directly up-regulates IRF-1 to the same extent as IFN-alpha in normal human T
cells and in NK cells. We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1, an
effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-gamma production.
Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1, whereas IFN-alpha and 
IL-12 did not. The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was
demonstrated in two ways. First, STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent
transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct, and second, STAT4 binding to the 
IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA. In contrast to IL-12, no up-regulation of
IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells, and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent 
up-regulation of IRF-1. Therefore, IRF-1 may be an important contributor to IL-12
signaling, and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1-/-
mice might be attributable, in part, to the absence of this transcription factor.

The role of HMG I(Y) in the assembly and function of the IFN-beta enhanceosome.

West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Transcriptional activation of the virus inducible enhancer of the human
interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene in response to virus infection requires the
assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators
NF-kappaB, ATF-2/c-Jun, IRFs and the architectural protein of the mammalian high 
mobility group I(Y) [HMG I(Y)]. Here, we demonstrate that the first step in
enhanceosome assembly, i.e. HMG I(Y)-dependent recruitment of NF-kappaB and
ATF-2/c-Jun to the enhancer, is facilitated by discrete regions of HMG I and is
mediated by allosteric changes induced in the DNA by HMG I(Y) and not by
protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and these proteins. However, we
show that completion of the enhanceosome assembly process requires
protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and the activators. Finally, we
demonstrate that once assembled, the IFN-beta enhanceosome is an unusually stable
nucleoprotein structure that can activate transcription at high levels by
promoting multiple rounds of reinitiation of transcription.

Interaction of interferon regulatory factor-1 and nuclear factor kappaB during
activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription.

(1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, The Johns 
Hopkins University School of Medicine, 720 Rutland Ave, Baltimore, MD, 21205,
USA.

We investigated the molecular mechanism for the synergistic induction of
inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Since
TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulate cells in part by activating NF-kappaB and
IRF-1, we hypothesized that these two transcription factors interact with each
other. IRF-1 and NF-kappaB co-localize in the nucleus of stimulated macrophages. 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that IRF-1 and NF-kappaB interact in
stimulated but not resting cells. Super-shift experiments show that IRF-1 and
NF-kappaB interact while binding to their respective DNA binding sites. These
results demonstrate the existence of a physical interaction between IRF-1 and
NF-kappaB proteins in vivo. We next suggested that this interaction between IRF-1
and NF-kappaB bends the DNA of the iNOS promoter region. Using a cyclization
assay, we demonstrate that nuclear extracts from stimulated cells accelerate the 
rate of conversion of a linear to circular DNA, compared to extracts from resting
cells. However, stimulated nuclear extracts cannot affect the rate of cyclization
of a promoter with a mutant IRE or kappaB site. Furthermore, stimulated nuclear
extracts depleted of IRF-1 and NF-kappaB cannot induce cyclization. We conclude
that IRF-1 and NF-kappaB interact in vivo, and that this interaction physically
bends the indicible nitric oxide synthase promoter DNA. This interaction may
explain the mechanism by which IFN-gamma synergistically augments inducible
nitric oxide synthase transcription.

The transcription factor IRF-1 has been implicated in tumor suppression: IRF-1
suppresses cell transformation and mediates apoptosis in vitro. Here we show that
the loss of IRF-1 alleles per se has no effect on spontaneous tumor development
in the mouse but dramatically exacerbates previous tumor predispositions caused
by the c-Ha-ras transgene or by nullizygosity for p53. Grossly altered tumor
spectrum, as compared to p53-null mice, was also observed in mice lacking both
IRF-1 and p53, and cells from these mice show significantly higher mutation rate.
Our results suggest that IRF-1 is a new member of the tumor susceptibility genes.

The role of HHV-8 in Kaposi's sarcoma.

Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, D-91054, Germany.

The epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) amongst North American and Northern
European patients with AIDS suggests that an infectious agent other than HIV is
involved in its pathogenesis. Several lines of evidence indicate that human
herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also termed Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus, is
the sought after agent. DNA of HHV-8 is invariably found in all forms of KS where
the virus is present in the KS spindle cell. In contrast, HHV-8 DNA is not
regularly detected in most other malignancies. Antibodies against HHV-8 are more 
frequently found in groups at risk of KS, and HHV-8 seroconversion precedes KS
development. Several HHV-8 genes have been identified that exhibit transforming
potential in cell culture systems. In addition, the virus encodes and induces
several cytokines and angiogenic factors. This is of particular interest as
models of KS pathogenesis developed before the discovery of HHV-8 emphasized the 
importance of inflammatory cytokines. Although the expression pattern of viral
genes in KS is not certain yet, it appears likely that the pathogenetic role of
HHV-8 in KS may be rather complex and differs from other virus-induced
malignancies. 1999 Academic Press.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) transcription factor binds to DNA sequence
elements found in the promoters of type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes. Transient 
up-regulation of the IRF-1 gene by virus and IFN treatment causes the consequent 
induction of many IFN-inducible genes involved in cell growth control and
apoptosis. We reported recently that IFN-alpha and all-trans retinoic Acid (RA)
inhibit the cell proliferation of squamous carcinoma cell line ME-180 by inducing
apoptotic cell death. IRF-1 expression correlates with the IFN-alpha-induced
apoptosis phenomenon and, surprisingly, with the RA-induced apoptosis phenomenon.
To study how these two different ligands cross-talk in the regulation of cellular
antitumor responses, the signalling pathways involved in IRF-1 induction were
analyzed in RA and/or IFN-alpha-treated ME-180 cells. We provide evidence
indicating that RA-induced IRF-1 gene expression is independent of the STAT-1
activation pathway, despite the presence of the IFN-gamma activated sequence
element in the gene promoter, but involves nuclear factor-kappaB activation.
Thus, here we first describe the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB by both
IFN-alpha and RA in the ME-180 cell line. The induced IRF-1 protein is
successively able to bind the IFN-stimulated responsive element in the promoter
of the target gene 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase.

IL-4 and IFN-gamma increase steady state levels of polymeric Ig receptor mRNA in 
human airway and intestinal epithelial cells.

Delivery of IgA to the mucosal surface occurs via transcytosis of polymeric IgA
(pIgA) across the epithelium, a process mediated by the pIgR. Several factors
increase pIgR expression in human epithelial cells, including IL-4 and IFN-gamma.
Using an RNase protection assay, we found that IL-4 and IFN-gamma increase steady
state levels of pIgR mRNA in both human intestinal (HT29) and airway (Calu-3)
epithelial cells. Time course studies in HT29 clone 19A cells showed that with
each cytokine alone and with both together: 1) there was a significant lag before
mRNA levels increased; 2) maximal levels were not reached until 48-72 h after the
addition of cytokines; 3) mRNA levels remained elevated in the continued presence
of cytokines; and 4) addition of actinomycin D or removal of cytokines led to
decreases in mRNA levels with a half-life of approximately 20-28 h.
Cytokine-dependent increases in steady state levels of pIgR mRNA were inhibited
by cycloheximide and by protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors but not by inhibitors 
of protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Both IFN-gamma and IL-4
increased expression of the inducible transcription factor IFN regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1), but levels of IRF-1 only weakly correlated with levels of pIgR 
mRNA, suggesting that additional transcription factors are required. These
studies provide additional insights into the mechanisms by which cytokines
regulate expression of the pIgR, a central player in mucosal immunity.

Altered immune response of interferon regulatory factor 1-deficient mice against

Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived biological mediator which can be induced in
various cell types and is able to cause many metabolic changes in target cells.
Inhibition of tumor cell growth and antimicrobial activity has been attributed to
the stimulation of NO production by transcriptional upregulation of inducible
nitric oxide synthase. In the present study, we used mice devoid of functional
interferon regulatory factor 1 by targeted gene disruption (IRF-1(-/-)) to
investigate the role of NO in the host immune response against blood-stage
Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection. IRF-1(-/-) mice survived longer with a later
onset of and a lower peak parasitemia despite the inability to produce
appreciable levels of NO. The administration of exogenous interleukin-12 (IL-12) 
was able to prolong survival in the wild-type mice with an upregulation in the
expression of both gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and NO. However, the
administration of IL-12 did not improve the survival of IRF-1(-/-) mice. These
studies indicate that while IL-12 is able to mediate protection via an IFN-gamma-
and NO-dependent pathway in the wild-type mice, such a protective mechanism may
not be functional in the IRF-1(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that NO may not be 
essential for host immunity to the parasite and that IRF-1(-/-) mice are able to 
induce an IFN-gamma- and NO-independent mechanism against P. berghei infection.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize an open reading frame (ORF) in
association with its mRNA and a coding protein recognized by anti-human
herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) monoclonal antibody B291.
STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: The antigen detected by B291 was characterized by
immunofluorescence method, Western blot analysis, laser confocal microscopy, and 
immunohistology cDNA of the protein was identified by immunoscreening the HHV-8
cDNA library with B291 and sequenced. Structure and kinetics of the mRNA
expression was investigated by 5',3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 
Northern blot analysis.
RESULTS: Viral interferon regulatory factor (vIRF; approximately 50 kd) was a
protein recognized by B291. It was detected in 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13
acetate (TPA)-induced, but not uninduced, HHV-8-infected cell lines (BCBL-1 and
BCP-1) and the tumor cells obtained from a SCID mouse injected with uninduced
BCBL-1. The expression of vIRF was predominantly in the nucleus and was partially
diminished by phosphonoformic acid (PFA) treatment, whereas the mRNA
(approximately 2.4 kb) was accumulated.
CONCLUSIONS: vIRF is an early protein expressed in the nucleus and may be
involved in Kaposi's sarcoma tumor formation.

Functional promoter modules can be detected by formal models independent of
overall nucleotide sequence similarity.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Mammalian Genetics, GSF-National Research Center for Environment 
and Health, Ingolstaedter Landstrasse 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.

MOTIVATION: Gene regulation often depends on functional modules which feature a
detectable internal organization. Overall sequence similarity of these modules is
often insufficient for detection by general search methods like FASTA or even
Gapped BLAST. However, it is of interest to evaluate whether modules, often known
from experimental analysis of single sequences, are present in other regulatory
sequences.
RESULTS: We developed a new method (FastM) which combines a search algorithm for 
individual transcription factor binding sites (MatInspector) with a distance
correlation function. FastM allows fast definition of a model of correlated
binding sites derived from as little as a single promoter or enhancer.
ModelInspector results are suitable for evaluation of the significance of the
model. We used FastM to define a model for the experimentally verified
NFkappaB/IRF1 regulatory module from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I HLA-B gene promoter. Analysis of a test set of sequences as well as
database searches with this model showed excellent correlation of the model with 
the biological function of the module. These results could not be obtained by
searches using FASTA or Gapped BLAST, which are based on sequence similarity. We 
were also able to demonstrate association of a hypothetical GRE-GRE module with
viral sequences based on analysis of several GenBank sections with this module.

Role of interferon and interferon regulatory factors in early protection against 
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection.

Grieder FB(1), Vogel SN.

the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814, USA. fgrieder@mxb.usuhs.mil

To investigate the role of type I interferon (IFN) and its regulatory transacting
proteins, interferon regulatory factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2), in early protection
against infection with virulent Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE), we
utilized mice with targeted mutations in the IFN-alpha/beta receptor, IRF-1, or
IRF-2 genes. IFN-alpha/beta-receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to
peripheral infection with virulent or attenuated VEE, resulting in their death
within 24 and 48 h, respectively. Treatment of normal macrophages with
anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibody prior to and during infection with molecularly
cloned virulent VEE resulted in increased VEE replication. However, treatment
with high doses of IFN or IFN-inducing agents failed to alter percentage
mortality or average survival times in mice challenged with a low dose of
virulent VEE. In IRF-1 and IRF-2 knockout mice (IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-2(-/-)), the
100% protection against virulent VEE that is conferred by attenuated VEE within
24 h in control C57BL/6 mice was completely absent in IRF-2(-/-) mice, whereas
50% of IRF-1(-/-) mice were protected. IRF-2(-/-) mice were deficient in clearing
VEE virus from the spleen and the brain compared to the heterozygous IRF-2(+/-)
knockout or C57BL/6 (+/+) mice. Furthermore, a distinct pattern of
histopathological changes was observed in brains of IRF-2(-/-) mice after VEE
exposure. Taken together, these findings imply that the altered immune response
in IRF-1 and IRF-2 knockout mice results in altered virus dissemination, altered 
virus clearance, and altered virus-induced pathology. Thus, type I interferon, as
well as IRF-1 and IRF-2, appears to play an important and necessary role in the
pathogenesis of, and protection against, VEE infection.

IRF-1 is an essential mediator in IFN-gamma-induced cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis of primary cultured hepatocytes.

IFN-gamma induces cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis in primary
cultured hepatocytes. However, it is not yet understood what molecules regulate
the mechanism. We report here that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is an
essential molecule in these phenomena. Hepatocytes from IRF-1-deficient mice were
completely resistant to IFN-gamma in apoptosis indicated by three different
hallmarks such as LDH release, DNA fragmentation and the activation of caspase-3 
family. Caspase-1 expression was little detected in hepatocytes, and constitutive
and IFN-gamma-induced mRNA expression of Fas or caspase-3 did not change in
between wild type and IRF-1-deficient hepatocytes. Expression of
IFN-gamma-inducible caspase, caspase-11, did not change either. Thus, it is
unlikely that these molecules directly regulate the mechanisms. Interestingly,
IRF-1-deficient hepatocytes were also resistant to IFN-gamma-induced cell cycle
arrest despite IFN-gamma-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are regulated by
independent pathways. Results by Northern blot analysis showed that
IFN-gamma-induced but not constitutive p53 mRNA expression was regulated by
IRF-1. In fact, IFN-gamma did not induce cell cycle arrest in p53-deficient
hepatocytes. Taken together, IRF-1 mediates IFN-gamma signaling into primary
hepatocytes for cell cycle arrest via p53 expression and for apoptosis.

IFN-gamma regulation of the type IV class II transactivator promoter in
astrocytes.

Dong Y(1), Rohn WM, Benveniste EN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294, USA.

The transcriptional activation of class II MHC genes requires the class II
transactivator (CIITA) protein, a regulator that is essential for both
constitutive and IFN-gamma-inducible class II MHC expression. The CIITA gene is
controlled by multiple independent promoters; two promoters direct constitutive
expression, while another, the type IV CIITA promoter, mediates IFN-gamma-induced
expression. We investigated the molecular regulation of IFN-gamma-induced type IV
CIITA promoter activity in astrocytes. IFN-gamma inducibility of the type IV
CIITA promoter is dependent on three cis-acting elements contained within a
154-bp fragment of the promoter; the proximal IFN-gamma activation sequence (GAS)
element, the E box, and the proximal IFN regulatory factor (IRF) element. Two
IFN-gamma-activated transcription factors, STAT-1alpha and IRF-1, bind the
proximal GAS and IRF elements, respectively. The E box binds upstream stimulating
factor-1 (USF-1), a constitutively expressed transcription factor. Furthermore,
STAT-1alpha binding to the proximal GAS element is dependent on the binding of
USF-1 to the adjacent E box. Functionally, the proximal IRF element is essential 
for IFN-gamma induction of type IV CIITA promoter activity, while the proximal
GAS and E box elements contribute to the IFN-gamma inducibility of this promoter.
In astrocytes, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC transcription.
Our results demonstrate that TNF-alpha does not enhance IFN-gamma-induced
transcriptional activation of the type IV CIITA promoter, indicating that the
enhancing effect of TNF-alpha is mediated downstream of CIITA transcription.
These results define the molecular basis of IFN-gamma activation of the type IV
CIITA promoter in astrocytes.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide prevent inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription in macrophages 
by inhibiting NF-kappa B and IFN regulatory factor 1 activation.

Delgado M(1), Munoz-Elias EJ, Gomariz RP, Ganea D.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.

High-output nitric oxide (NO) production from activated macrophages, resulting
from the induction of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, represents a major
mechanism for macrophage cytotoxicity against pathogens. However, despite its
beneficial role in host defense, sustained high-output NO production was also
implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases.
Therefore, the down-regulation of iNOS expression during an inflammatory process 
plays a significant physiological role. This study examines the role of two
immunomodulatory neuropeptides, the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the
pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), on NO production by
LPS-, IFN-gamma-, and LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated peritoneal macrophages and the Raw
264.7 cell line. Both VIP and PACAP inhibit NO production in a dose- and
time-dependent manner by reducing iNOS expression at protein and mRNA level.
VPAC1, the type 1 VIP receptor, which is constitutively expressed in macrophages,
and to a lesser degree VPAC2, the type 2 VIP receptor, which is induced upon
macrophage activation, mediate the effect of VIP/PACAP. VIP/PACAP inhibit iNOS
expression and activity both in vivo and in vitro. Two transduction pathways
appear to be involved, a cAMP-dependent pathway that preferentially inhibits IFN 
regulatory factor-1 transactivation and a cAMP-independent pathway that blocks
NF-kappa B binding to the iNOS promoter. The down-regulation of iNOS expression, 
together with previously reported inhibitory effects on the production of the
proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-12, and the stimulation of the 
anti-inflammatory IL-10, define VIP and PACAP as "macrophage deactivating
factors" with significant physiological relevance.

The immune response modifier imiquimod requires STAT-1 for induction of
interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and interleukin-6.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, ICB, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

Imiquimod is an oral inducer of interferon (IFN) and several other
proinflammatory cytokines and has been successfully used topically as an
antiviral agent for the treatment of genital warts. We have investigated the
molecular mechanisms by which imiquimod induces the expression of IFNs,
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and proinflammatory cytokines in vivo, using mice
deficient in various components of the IFN signaling system. Mice deficient in
the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) or in the
serine/threonine protein kinase PKR responded normally to imiquimod, producing
high levels of circulating IFN and induction of several ISGs. On the other hand, 
when mice deficient in STAT-1 were treated, a 32-fold reduction in the level of
circulating IFN was observed, together with a lack of induction of 2-5 oligo
adenylate synthetase (2-5 OAS) and IRF-1 genes. Interestingly, there was also a
lack of induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression, although tumor
necrosis factor was induced and readily detected in serum. In mice deficient in
the type I IFN receptor, imiquimod induced levels of IFN similar to those in
control mice, but again, neither 2-5 OAS, IRF-1, nor IL-6 genes were induced in
mutant mice. Our results suggest that STAT-1 plays a critical role in the
mechanism of gene activation by imiquimod. Moreover, induction of IL-6 gene
expression appears to be dependent on components of the IFN signaling cascade.

Interferon-gamma signaling in human retinal pigment epithelial cells mediated by 
STAT1, ICSBP, and IRF-1 transcription factors.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Immunology, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

PURPOSE: Studies have shown that interferon (IFN)-gamma stimulates expression of 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II, interleukin (IL)-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase and
inhibits replication of Toxoplasma gondii in human retinal pigment epithelial
(HRPE) cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate the molecular
mechanisms of IFN-gamma action.
METHODS: RNA, whole-cell extracts, and nuclear extracts were prepared from HRPE
cells cultured in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma. Activation of
IFN-gamma-responsive genes was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot analysis, 
and immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: HRPE cells constitutively expressed two members of the IFN regulatory
factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, IRF-1 and IRF-2. After exposure to 
IFN-gamma, transcription of IRF-1 and IFN consensus sequence binding protein
(ICSBP) genes were induced; IRF-2 gene transcription was not upregulated.
Activation of IFN-gamma-responsive genes was mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation
of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 factor.
CONCLUSIONS: This study characterized the IFN-gamma signaling pathway in HRPE
cells and identified IRF-1, ICSBP, and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 as mediators
of IFN-gamma action in these cells. ICSBP is thought to be exclusively used in
immunologic responses and has previously been detected only in lymphoid cells.
However, the current study shows that ICSBP expression is inducible in HRPE
cells, suggesting that it may regulate gene transcription in RPE cells and
possibly in other nonimmunologic cell types.

A role for casein kinase II phosphorylation in the regulation of IRF-1
transcriptional activity.

Lin R(1), Hiscott J.

Author information: 
(1)Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, and Department of Medicine, McGill 
University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFS) play an important role in the
transcriptional control of growth regulatory and immunoregulatory genes. The
inducibility and availability of IRF-1 and IRF-2 are influenced by external
stimuli, such as virus infection or interferon treatment. In the present study,
we sought to examine the potential modulatory role of phosphorylation on IRF-1
transcriptional activity. During the purification of IRF recombinant proteins, a 
kinase activity copurified with IRF-1 (and IRF-2) from baculovirus infected Sf9
insect cell extracts, but not from E. coli extracts. The kinase activity was also
identified in Jurkat T cells, specifically interacted with IRF proteins in GST
affinity chromatography, and phosphorylated IRF-1 with high specificity in vitro.
Using an in gel kinase assay with recombinant IRF-1 as substrate, two molecular
weight forms of the kinase (43 and 38 kDa) were identified. Biochemical criteria 
identified the kinase activity as the alpha catalytic subunit of casein kinase II
(CKII). Furthermore, far western analysis of protein-protein interactions
demonstrated that casein kinase II directly interacted with IRF-1 protein.
Deletion mutation analysis of IRF-1 revealed that IRF-1 was phosphorylated at two
clustered sites, one located between amino acids 138-150, the other in the
C-terminal acidic activation domain between amino acids 219-231. Cotransfection
studies comparing wild type and point mutated forms of IRF-1 demonstrated that
mutations of the four phosphoaceptor residues in the C-terminal transactivation
domain, significantly decreased transactivation by IRF-1, indicating that casein 
kinase II may be involved in the regulation of IRF-1 function. Strikingly, the
casein kinase II clusters in IRF-1 resemble the sites identified in the
C-terminal PEST domain of IkappaBalpha. The present experiments, together with
previously published studies with IkappaBalpha, c-Jun and other proteins,
indicate a broad role for casein kinase II phosphorylation in the regulation of
transcription factor activity.

Negative modulation of alpha1(I) procollagen gene expression in human skin
fibroblasts: transcriptional inhibition by interferon-gamma.

(1)Section of Rheumatology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a multifunctional cytokine produced by activated
Th1 lymphocytes, exerts potent effects on the extracellular matrix by regulating 
fibroblast function. In this study, we examined the modulation of alpha1(I)
procollagen gene (COL1A1) expression by recombinant IFN-gamma. The results showed
that IFN-gamma stimulated the rapid accumulation of interferon regulated factor
(IRF)-1 mRNA, followed by a delayed and dose-dependent inhibition of alpha1(I)
procollagen mRNA expression in skin fibroblasts from several different donors.
The inhibitory response was abrogated in fibroblasts stably expressing IRF-1 in
the antisense orientation. A marked decrease in the amount of heterogeneous
nuclear pre-mRNA preceded the inhibition of COL1A1 mRNA expression. In
fibroblasts transiently transfected with COL1A1 promoter-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase reporter gene plasmids, IFN-gamma selectively inhibited
promoter activity and abrogated its stimulation induced by TGF-beta. The
inhibition by IFN-gamma was not due to downregulation of TGF-beta receptor mRNA
expression in the fibroblasts or decreased ligand binding to the receptor.
IFN-alpha and IFN-beta by themselves had little effect on promoter activity, but 
IFN-alpha augmented the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma. Using a series of 5'
deletion constructs, a proximal region of the COL1A1 promoter was shown to
function as an IFN-gamma response element. This region of the gene harbors
overlapping binding sites for transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and NF-1 but no
homologs of previously characterized IFN-gamma response elements. The putative
IFN-gamma response region was sufficient to confer inhibition of reporter gene
expression by treatment with IFN-gamma. Gel mobility shift analysis showed that
two distinct and specific DNA-protein complexes were formed when fibroblast
nuclear extracts were incubated with oligonucleotides spanning the IFN-gamma
response region. IFN-gamma did not modify the ability of nuclear proteins to bind
to this region. The results indicate that IFN-gamma inhibits COL1A1 expression in
fibroblasts principally at the level of gene transcription. Inhibition involves
IRF-1 and is mediated through a short proximal promoter segment but without an
apparent change in promoter occupancy. The findings provide novel insight into
the mechanism of IFN-gamma regulation of fibroblast function.

Interleukin-4-mediated inhibition of nitric oxide production in
interferon-gamma-treated and virus-infected macrophages.

Paludan SR(1), Ellermann-Eriksen S, Lovmand J, Mogensen SC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Aarhus,
Denmark.

Upon interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation, murine macrophages (Mphi) produce 
nitric oxide (NO) through expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
Interleukin (IL)-4 treatment, even delayed 12 h relative to IFN-gamma,
antagonized this induction, whereas infection with herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) or treatment with tumour necrosis factor-alpha exerted a synergistic
effect, which partly compensated for the antagonistic effect of IL-4. Neither
IL-4 nor HSV-2 affected the IFN-gamma-activated Jak-STAT (Janus kinase-signal
transducer and activator of transcription) pathway or altered the levels of
IFN-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 expression, which is
STAT1-dependent and known to play a central role in IFN-gamma-mediated gene
induction. The effect of IL-4 was completely dependent on de novo protein
synthesis, indicating that a direct activation of latent inhibitors is not
sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect of IL-4. Furthermore, IL-4
substantially augmented the IFN-gamma-induced expression of IRF-2, which is known
to compete with IRF-1 for the DNA recognition site, ISRE (interferon-stimulated
response element). Our findings could indicate that IL-4 suppresses
IFN-gamma-stimulated iNOS transcription by elevating the level of IRF-2 which,
through competition, prevents IRF-1 from binding to ISRE in the iNOS promoter.
The virus-induced effects on iNOS and NO levels in IFN-gamma-stimulated Mphi do
not seem to involve the Jak/STAT pathway or a differential expression of IRF-1
and IRF-2.

Cyclosporin A suppresses the induction of nitric oxide synthesis in
interferon-gamma-treated L929 fibroblasts.

The effects of immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) on nitric oxide (NO)
production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activity in murine L929 fibroblasts
were investigated. IFN-gamma-induced NO production in L929 cells was mediated
through an iNOS-dependent L-arginine-NO pathway, since it was abrogated by a
selective inhibitor of iNOS, aminoguanidine. CsA applied simultaneously with
IFN-gamma caused a dose-dependent reduction of NO synthesis in L929 cells.
However, CsA did not influence the enzymatic activity of iNOS, since it failed to
affect NO production in cells in which iNOS had already been induced with
IFN-gamma and any further induction was blocked by the protein-synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide. IFN-gamma-triggered expression of mRNA for interferon
regulatory factor-1 was not reduced by CsA-treatment, suggesting that this iNOS
transcription factor is not a target in CsA-mediated inhibition of NO synthesis. 
Finally, FK506 was not able to mimic the inhibitory effect of CsA on NO
production in L929 cells, indicating the calcineurin-independent mechanism of CsA
action. These results indicate that CsA suppresses NO synthesis in L929 cells
independent of calcineurin inhibition, and interfering with intracellular
pathways involved in the iNOS induction, rather than inhibiting its enzymatic
activity.

Psoriatic keratinocytes show reduced IRF-1 and STAT-1alpha activation in response
to gamma-IFN.

(1)Department of Dermatology, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis characterized by
hyperproliferative keratinocytes (KC). The skin lesions are infiltrated by T
cells, which secrete gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) and are believed to be
necessary to maintain the psoriatic phenotype. In normal KC, gamma-IFN is a
potent inhibitor of proliferation, but proliferation of KC persists in psoriatic 
plaques despite the presence of gamma-IFN. Immunostaining of interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) revealed that IRF-1 was localized to the basal cells 
of the epidermis in normal and in nonlesional psoriatic skin, but was suprabasal 
or completely absent in lesional psoriatic skin. This finding led to the
hypothesis that abnormal signaling in the gamma-IFN pathway may occur in
psoriatic KC. To test this hypothesis, we measured activation of IRF-1 and signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1alpha transcription factors in 
KC after stimulation with gamma-IFN. Primary cultures of KC from normal and
nonlesional psoriatic skin were stimulated with gamma-IFN and subsequent
transcription factor activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. Psoriatic KC showed a reduced induction of IRF-1 and STAT-1alpha
activation after stimulation with gamma-IFN, compared with normal KC. Reduced
activation of IRF-1 and STAT-1alpha in response to gamma-IFN indicates a
fundamental defect in the growth and differentiation control of psoriatic KC in
the absence of the influence of other cell types.

Interleukin-12 induces expression of interferon regulatory factor-1 via signal
transducer and activator of transcription-4 in human T helper type 1 cells.

IRF-1-deficient mice show a striking defect in the development of T helper 1
(Th1) cells. In the present report, we investigate the expression of IRF-1 during
differentiation of human T helper cells. No significant differences of IRF-1 mRNA
expression were found in established Th1 and Th2 cells; however, interleukin 12
(IL-12) induced a strong up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts in Th1 but not in Th2
cells. We demonstrate that IL-12-induced up-regulation of IRF-1 is mediated by
signal transducer and activator of transcription-4, which binds to the interferon
(IFN)-gamma-activated sequence present in the promoter of the IRF-1 gene. Strong 
IL-12-dependent activation of a reporter gene construct containing the IRF-1
IFN-gamma-activated sequence element provides further evidence for the key role
of signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 in the IL-12-induced
up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts in T cells. IRF-1 expression was strongly
induced after stimulation of naive CD4(+) T cells via the T cell receptor,
irrespective of the cytokines present at priming, indicating that this
transcription factor does not play a major role in initiating a Th1-specific
transcriptional cascade in differentiating helper T cells. However, our finding
that IRF-1 is a target gene of IL-12 suggests that some of the IL-12-induced
effector functions of Th1 cells may be mediated by IRF-1.

The histone acetylase PCAF is a phorbol-ester-inducible coactivator of the IRF
family that confers enhanced interferon responsiveness.

Transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family bind to
the type I interferon (IFN)-responsive element (ISRE) and activate transcription 
from IFN-inducible genes. To identify cofactors that associate with IRF proteins,
DNA affinity binding assays were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from
tissue culture cells. The results demonstrated that the endogenous IRFs bound to 
the ISRE are complexed with the histone acetylases, PCAF, GCN5, and p300/CREB
binding protein and that histone acetylase activities are accumulated on the
IRF-ISRE complexes. By testing recombinant proteins, we show that PCAF directly
binds to some but not all members of the IRF family through distinct domains of
the two proteins. This interaction was functionally significant, since
transfection of PCAF strongly enhanced IRF-1- and IRF-2-dependent promoter
activities. Further studies showed that expression of PCAF and other histone
acetylases was markedly induced in U937 cells upon phorbol ester treatment, which
led to increased recruitment of PCAF to the IRF-ISRE complexes. Coinciding with
the induction of histone acetylases, phorbol ester markedly enhanced
IFN-alpha-stimulated gene expression in U937 cells. Supporting the role for PCAF 
in conferring IFN responsiveness, transfection of PCAF into U937 cells led to a
large increase in IFN-alpha-inducible promoter activity. These results
demonstrate that PCAF is a phorbol ester-inducible coactivator of the IRF
proteins which contributes to the establishment of type I IFN responsiveness.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is involved in
the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and apoptosis, processes that contribute
to ischemic brain injury. In this study, the induction of IRF-1 in response to
cerebral ischemia and its role in ischemic brain injury were investigated. IRF-1 
gene expression was markedly upregulated within 12 h of occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery in C57BL/6 mice. The expression reached a peak 4 d after ischemia
(6.0 +/- 1.8-fold; P < 0.001) and was restricted to the ischemic regions of the
brain. The volume of ischemic injury was reduced by 23 +/- 3% in IRF-1(+/-) and
by 46 +/- 9% in IRF-1(-/-) mice (P < 0.05). The reduction in infarct volume was
paralleled by a substantial attenuation in neurological deficits. Thus, IRF-1 is 
the first nuclear transacting factor demonstrated to contribute directly to
cerebral ischemic damage and may be a novel therapeutic target in ischemic
stroke.

Cutting edge: coordinate regulation of IFN regulatory factor-1 and the polymeric 
Ig receptor by proinflammatory cytokines.

The polymeric IgR (pIgR) mediates transcytosis of IgA across epithelial barriers 
of mucous membranes and exocrine glands. Synthesis of pIgR is up-regulated by the
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1 in HT-29 human colon
carcinoma cells. We previously reported that IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induce
production of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in HT-29
cells and that IRF-1 binds to an element in exon 1 of the PIGR gene. We now
report that levels of IRF-1 and pIgR mRNA are coordinately regulated in HT-29
cells by TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in 
vivo expression of pIgR mRNA is greatly depressed in the intestine and liver of
IRF-1-deficient mice. Our findings indicate a major role for the IRF-1
transcription factor in regulation of the PIGR gene and suggest a model for
regulation of important genes in the mucosal immune system by proinflammatory
cytokines.

-Apoptosis has been reported to play a pivotal role in vascular remodeling.
However, cellular mechanisms of apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
have not been well defined. In this study, we focused on
interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), a key protease in the induction of
apoptosis in lymphocytes and fibroblasts. We observed an increase in ICE mRNA
expression in rat aortic VSMCs after serum depletion, with a peak at 12 hours and
then a gradual decline. This was associated with DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of
apoptosis and morphological changes of apoptosis. Treatment of these VSMCs with
the ICE inhibitor N-(N-acetyl-tyrosinyl-valinyl-alaninyl)-3-amino-4-oxob utanoic 
acid (YVAD-CHO) attenuated DNA fragmentation. The increased ICE mRNA expression
was preceded by an increase in the mRNA expression of interferon regulatory
factor (IRF)-1, peaking at 6 hours after serum removal, and a rapid but transient
decrease in IRF-2 mRNA expression, reaching a nadir at 3 hours after serum
depletion. To demonstrate that these reciprocal changes in IRF-1 and IRF-2
regulated ICE expression and induced apoptosis, we transfected antisense
oligonucleotides for IRF-1 and IRF-2 into VSMCs and examined ICE mRNA expression 
and apoptotic changes. IRF-1 antisense pretreatment attenuated the increase in
ICE expression and reduced apoptotic changes, whereas IRF-2 antisense treatment
increased ICE mRNA expression and enhanced apoptotic changes. Taken together, our
results suggest that serum growth factor depletion in VSMCs upregulates IRF-1 and
downregulates IRF-2, thereby increasing ICE expression and inducing apoptosis.

MyD genes in negative growth control.

Liebermann DA(1), Hoffman B.

Author information: 
(1)Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University
School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.

Two interrelated cellular processes are invoked simultaneously upon induction of 
differentiation, the regulated progression of cells through successive stages of 
cell differentiation and growth inhibition which ultimately leads to growth
arrest. In tissues with rapid cell turnover terminally differentiated cells
undergo programmed cell death. Terminal differentiation, thus, represents one
form of negative growth control. It was surmised that the molecular engine which 
drives the differentiation process forward requires induction of positive
regulators of terminal cell differentiation, to be found among differentiation
primary response genes, as well as suppression of negative regulators, which
correspond to genes which control cellular growth. This line of thought has
prompted the isolation of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes
activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, upon IL-6 induced terminal
differentiation of murine M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, where the cells growth 
arrest and ultimately undergo programmed cell death. As delineated in this review
many of the genes identified as MyD genes, including both known genes [IRF-1,
(AP-1)Fos/Jun.EGR-1] and novel ones (MyD88, MyD116, MyD118), turned out to play a
role in negative growth control, including growth suppression and apoptosis, in
many cell types, of both hematopoietic and non hematopoietic origins.

IL-1 beta inhibits IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC expression by suppressing
transcription of the class II transactivator gene.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Alabama, Birmingham

Class II MHC Ags are critical for the initiation of immune responses by
presenting Ag to T lymphocytes, leading to their activation and differentiation. 
The transcriptional activation of class II MHC genes requires the induction of
the class II transactivator (CIITA) protein, a master regulator that is essential
for both constitutive and IFN-gamma-inducible class II MHC expression. The
cytokine IL-1beta has been shown to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC
expression in various cell types. We investigated the underlying mechanism of
this inhibitory effect of IL-1beta using human astroglioma cell lines. Our
findings demonstrate that IL-1beta prevents the expression of class II MHC mRNA
and protein upon treatment with IFN-gamma. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
IFN-gamma induction of CIITA mRNA expression is inhibited by treatment of cells
with IL-1beta. IL-1beta suppressed IFN-gamma activation of the type IV CIITA
promoter in astroglioma cells, indicating that the inhibitory influence of
IL-1beta is mediated by inhibition of CIITA transcription. IL-1beta did not
interfere with IFN-gamma receptor signal transduction, since tyrosine
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of STAT-1alpha to an
IFN-gamma activation sequence of the type IV CIITA promoter were not affected by 
IL-1beta. As well, IL-1beta treatment did not affect the ability of
IFN-gamma-induced interferon-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) to bind the IRF-1
element within the type IV CIITA promoter. This study suggests that IL-1beta may 
play a role in regulating immunoreactivity by inhibiting transcription of the
CIITA gene, thereby reducing subsequent class II MHC expression.

Recent studies have revealed promising leads on the potential of interferons
(IFNs) in combination with retinoids in solid tumor therapy. The role of
IFN-alpha and retinoic acid (RA) in cervical cancer is currently under active
study. Because preclinical and clinical data on IFN-beta in combination with
retinoids show promising results against breast carcinoma, we analysed the
anti-proliferative effect of human recombinant IFN-beta alone or in combination
with all-trans RA on two human squamous cervical carcinoma cell (SCC) lines
(ME180 and SiHa). The two cell lines differ in their sensitivity to the
anti-proliferative effects of the different agents and their combination: i) both
cell lines were more responsive to IFN-beta than to IFN-alpha2b; ii) combined
treatment with RA increases the growth inhibitory effect of the single agents in 
ME180, but not in SiHa; iii) the antiproliferative effect correlates with the
induction of apoptosis. We suggest as a possible mechanisms of action that
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor which belongs to
the IFN machinery, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi) p21 can be
involved in cellular growth inhibition and in the induction of apoptosis. These
results support the use of IFN-beta in further clinical investigation possibly in
combination with retinoids.

IFN-gamma induces transcription of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Recently,
the IFN-gamma-dependent Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway has been shown to mediate
the activation of some ISGs, by the sequential phosphorylation of two JAK kinases
(JAK1 and JAK2) and of STAT1. Given that the JAK/STAT is the major, but not the
only pathway linked to the IFN-gammaR, aim of our work was to investigate the
signal-transduction pathway(s) by which IFN-gamma exerts its effects on acute
replication of HIV in monocytic cells. To this end, we utilized clones previously
derived from the U937 promonocytic cell line, differing for their efficient (plus
clones) or inefficient (minus clones) abilities of supporting HIV replication.
Unlike IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma did not inhibit HIV replication in plus clones,
whereas virus production in minus cells was efficiently inhibited by both types
of IFN. Plus clones generated a JAK/STAT signal-transduction pathway in response 
to IFN-alpha, but not IFN-gamma. In contrast, minus clones responded to either
cytokines. The functional defect of plus clones in response to IFN-gamma was
correlated to a selective defect of IFN-gammaR2, but not IFN-gammaR1, membrane
expression. Surprisingly enough, IFN-gamma stimulation of plus clones induced
IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3gamma). These results strongly support the
hypothesis that the JAK/STAT pathway is responsible for the antiretroviral effect
of IFN-gamma, and further provide evidence for a potential second pathway
triggered by IFN-gamma in the absence of IFN-gammaR2 chain cell surface
expression and involving ISGF3gamma.

The effects of immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) on nitric oxide (NO)
production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression in rat C6 glioma cell
line were investigated. CsA applied simultaneously with iNOS activator IFN-gamma 
caused dose-dependent reduction of NO synthesis in confluent C6 cells, as
determined by measuring accumulation of nitrite, an indicator of NO production,
in 48 h culture supernatants. IFN-gamma-induced expression of iNOS, but not
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) mRNA was reduced in CsA-treated cells. The
enzymatic activity of iNOS was not changed by CsA, since it failed to affect NO
production in cells in which iNOS had already been induced with IFN-gamma and any
further induction was blocked by protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX).
FK506 was not able to mimic inhibitory effect of CsA on NO production in C6
cells, suggesting calcineurin-independent mechanism of CsA action.

As a response to viral infection, cells express the early inflammatory genes that
encode small proteins generally called cytokines or chemokines. These protein can
activate immune responses to viral infection as well as to modulate directly the 
outcome of viral infection. The group of proteins with the direct antiviral
effects have been called interferons. The stimulation of interferon synthesis in 
infected cells is regulated on a transcriptional level and two families of
cellular transcriptional factors seem to play a critical role in the
transcriptional activation of interferon genes. The first one are the proteins of
NF-kappaB family and the second is the family of the interferon responsive
factors. While both of the types of the transcriptional factors are important for
the induction of interferon beta gene, the NF-kappaB factor do not seems to
participate in the induction of interferon alpha genes. The present review is
focused on the recently identified new members of cellular IRF family and their
role in virus mediated response, responses and cell growth. In addition the HHV-8
encoded vIRFs are described.

The role of interferon regulatory factors in the interferon system and cell
growth control.

MO 63110, USA.

Complex cellular responses are often coordinated by a genetic regulatory network 
in which a given transcription factor controls the expression of a diverse set of
target genes. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 have originally been
identified as a transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively, of the
interferon-beta (IFN-beta) as well as of IFN-inducible genes. However, these
factors have since been shown to modulate not only the cellular response to IFNs,
but also cell growth, susceptibility to transformation by oncogenes, induction of
apoptosis, and development of the T cell immune response. Furthermore, the
evidence suggests that deletion and/or inactivation of the IRF-1 gene may be a
critical step in the development of some human hematopoietic neoplasms.
Subsequently, these factors have been shown to constitute a family of
transcription factors, termed the IRF-family. Recent studies indicate that other 
IRF family members also involve the regulation of the IFN system and cell
transformation. The IRF-family may be examples of transcription factors which can
selectively modulate several sets of genes depending on the cell type and/or
nature of the cellular stimuli, so as to evoke host defense mechanisms against
infection and oncogenesis.

IFN-gamma induces a number of cellular programs functional in innate and adaptive
resistance to infectious pathogens. It has recently become clear that the
complete cellular response to IFN-gamma is extraordinarily complex, with >500
genes (i.e., approximately 0.5% of the genome) activated. We made
suppression-subtractive hybridization differential libraries from
IFN-gamma-stimulated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and from a mouse
macrophage cell line, ANA-1, in each case with reference to unstimulated cells.
Of approximately 250 clones sequenced at random from the two libraries, >35% were
representatives of one or the other of two small unrelated families of GTPases,
the 65-kDa and 47-kDa families. These families dominate the IFN-gamma-induced
response in both cell types. We report here the full-length sequences of one new 
65-kDa and two new 47-kDa family members. The 65-kDa family members are under
transcriptional control of IRF-1, whereas the 47-kDa family members are inducible
in embryonic fibroblasts from IRF-1(-/-) mice. Members of both GTPase families
are strongly up-regulated in livers of wild-type mice infected with the
pathogenic bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, but not in IFN-gammaR(0/0) mice.
These GTPases appear to be dedicated to the IFN-gamma response, since resting
levels are negligible and since neither family shows any significant relationship
to any other described family of GTPases. Understanding the role of these GTPases
in IFN-gamma-mediated resistance against pathogens is the task for the future.

Two distinct gamma interferon-inducible promoters of the major histocompatibility

Carolina, USA.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) is the
master regulatory factor required for appropriate expression of class II MHC
genes. Understanding the expression of CIITA is key to understanding the
regulation of class II MHC genes. This report describes the independent
regulation of two distinct CIITA promoters by cytokines with opposing functions, 
gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). A
functional analysis of deletion mutations of the upstream promoter (promoter III)
identified an IFN-gamma-responsive region located approximately 5 kb from the
transcriptional start site. An in vivo DNase I hypersensitivity analysis detected
a hypersensitive site in this area which supports the relevance of this region.
When the downstream promoter (promoter IV) was studied by in vivo genomic
footprinting, IFN-gamma-induced changes at putative binding sites for STAT1,
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), and E-box proteins were seen. Gel shift
and supershift analyses for IRF-1 confirmed the in vivo footprint results. The
role of the IFN-gamma-inducible transcription factor STAT1 was examined
functionally. Although both promoters were controlled by STAT1, promoter-specific
regulation was exhibited. The IFN-gamma response of promoter III was completely
dependent on STAT1 and not IRF-1, while promoter IV was partially activated by
IRF-1 in the total absence of STAT1 expression. While both promoters were
affected by TGF-beta, activation of promoter III by IFN-gamma was more severely
diminished by TGF-beta treatment. The differential control of CIITA promoters by 
TGF-beta, IRF-1, and STAT1 may be important in refining regulation of class II
MHC genes in different cell types and under different stimulatory conditions.

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 transcription: role of the 5'-untranslated
leader region (review).

Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) transcription is dependent on the
interaction of host-cell transcription factors with cis-regulatory DNA elements
within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Much attention has focused on the
series of sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional initiation site in
the U3 region of the LTR including the Sp1 and NF-kappaB binding sites. Recent
studies, however, demonstrate that the transcribed 5'-untranslated leader region 
(5'-UTR) also contains important transcriptional elements. These regulatory
elements situated downstream of transcription interact with constitutive and
inducible transcription factors, mediate transmission of cellular activation
signals, and are important for efficient HIV-1 transcription and replication. The
5'-UTR contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1, NF-kappaB,
NF-AT, IRF, and Sp1. Mutations in these binding sites can interfere with the
viral response to cell activation signals, decrease LTR transcription, and
inhibit viral replication. The 5'-UTR also interacts with a specific nucleosome
that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent
provirus. We propose that the inducible transcription factor binding sites in the
5'-UTR comprise a downstream enhancer domain that can function independent of, or
in concert with, the LTR promoter to rapidly increase latent proviral
transcription in response to cell activation signals. In this review, we describe
the host-cell transcription factors that interact with the 5'-UTR and discuss
their role in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression.

Thymocyte selection in Vav and IRF-1 gene-deficient mice.

T cells undergo a defined program of phenotypic and genetic changes during
differentiation within the thymus. These changes define commitment of T-cell
receptor (TCR) gamma delta and TCR alpha beta cells and lineage differentiation
into CD4+ T helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. T-cell differentiation and
selection in the thymus constitute a tightly co-ordinated multistep journey
through a network that can be envisaged as a three-dimensional informational
highway made up of stromal cells and extracellular matrix molecules. This
intrathymic journey is controlled by information exchange, with thymocytes
depending on two-way cellular interactions with thymic stromal cells in order to 
receive essential signals for maturation and selection. Genetic inactivation of
surface receptors, signal transduction molecules, and transcription factors using
homologous recombination has provided novel insight into the signaling cascades
that relay surface receptor engagement to gene transcription and subsequent
progression of the developmental program. In this review we discuss molecular
mechanisms of T lymphocyte development in mice that harbour genetic mutations in 
the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav and the interferon regulatory
transcription factor 1 (IRF-1). We also propose a novel model of T-cell selection
based on TCR alpha chain-directed signals for allelic exclusion and TCR
alpha-based selection for single receptor usage.

Changes in interferon-regulatory factor-1 mRNA levels after transient ischemia in
rat brain.

Author information:

Research, Köln, Germany.

To evaluate whether the interferon system in the brain is activated by a severe
form of metabolic stress, and to elucidate the possible mechanism underlying this
activation, changes in the interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf-1) mRNA levels
were evaluated after transient cerebral ischemia, and after exposure of primary
neuronal cells to experimental conditions resulting in a depletion of ER calcium 
stores. Following 30 min ischemia and 2 h recovery, irf-1 mRNA levels rose
significantly and stayed high for up to 24 h of recovery. Irf-1 mRNA levels were 
also significantly increased in neurons in vitro after exposing cells to
conditions resulting in ER calcium store depletion with or without a parallel
increase in cytoplasmic calcium activity. It is concluded that transient cerebral
ischemia induces activation of the interferon system and that disturbances of ER 
calcium homeostasis may play a role in this process.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator which was
originally identified as the regulator of the type I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) 
gene expression. Subsequent studies have revealed that IRF-1 is involved in a
wide spectrum of the host defense mechanisms, including the antiviral response by
IFNs. IRF-1 has also been shown to regulate a variety of cytokines and their
target genes, thereby contributing to the development and function of the
Th1-type immune response. Furthermore, IRF-1 is a critical regulator of cell
growth and death, and its inactivation accelerates cell transformation. IRF-1 may
be a prototypical example of a transcription factor which can selectively
modulate distinct sets of genes depending on the cell type and/or nature of the
cellular stimuli, so as to evoke appropriate response in each.

Although there have been reports regarding the clinical effectiveness of IFN
alpha in the treatment of myeloma patients during this decade, its biological
effects on human myeloma cells have still not been clarified. Recently, apoptosis
has been considered as one of the most important mechanisms in the programmed
cell death of malignant tumour cells induced by chemotherapeutic agents or
cytotoxic immunological defence in malignancy-carrying hosts. Among the several
pathways which function to induce apoptosis, Fas and the Fas ligand system have
been thought to play an important role in inducing tumour-cell apoptosis,
particularly in immunological prevention. In this study we investigated myeloma
cell apoptosis induced by IFN alpha using five human myeloma cell lines which
were established without any additional supplementation of IL-6. In addition, the
mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes employing the reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were also analysed with the
KMS-12-PE cell line, which was the most sensitive of the five cell lines in terms
of apoptosis induced by IFN alpha. Based on the results, it was determined that
IFN alpha induced myeloma cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, but the
sensitivity to IFN alpha in the cell lines examined varied and one cell line
revealed growth stimulation by IFN alpha. In addition, the apoptosis induced by
IFN alpha did not seem to be mediated by the Fas/Fas ligand pathway. Finally, the
IL-6, IL-6R, IRF1 and IRF2 genes were up-regulated in KMS-12-PE cells cultured
with IFN alpha. Therefore these genes may play an important role during apoptosis
induced by IFN alpha.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 gene abnormality and loss of growth inhibitory
effect of interferon-alpha in human hepatoma cell lines.

The effect of IFN-alpha on the growth of 5 hepatoma cell lines and a normal
liver-derived cell line were examined. IFN dose-dependently inhibited the growth 
of cell lines except for HLE and PLC/PRF/5 in which the inhibition only occurred 
at a high concentration over 10,000 IU/ml. IFN-alpha induced the G1 arrest of
these cells according to upregulation of p21WAF-1 expression, which is induced in
PLC/PRF/5 and HLE only at a high IFN concentration. The receptor for IFN-alpha
was well expressed in all the cell lines. DNA rearrangement of IRF-1 was detected
in HLE and PLC/PRF/5 by Southern blotting, while IRF-2 gene was preserved.
IFN-induced gene expressions were compared between HCC-T, HCC-M and PLC/PRF/5.
RT-PCR demonstrated that the full-length IRF-1 and -2 mRNA was transcribed in all
cell lines, but the mRNA amount of former gene in PLC/PRF/5 was less than that in
HCC-T and HCC-M, about 1/10 by competitive RT-PCR. The sequence analysis of IRF-1
cDNA was performed and the full-length mRNA transcription was reconfirmed in
PLC/PRF/5, but no significant point mutation was detected. These results suggest 
that IFN-alpha inhibits hepatoma growth by increasing p21WAF-1 expression only
when the IRF-1 gene is preserved normally.

Maximal induction of p69 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in Daudi cells requires
cooperation between an ISRE and two IRF-1-like elements.

Wang Q(1), Floyd-Smith G.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular and Cellular Biology Program and Department of Biology, Arizona
State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1501, USA.

The human 2', 5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases are members of a family
interferon (IFN)-inducible anti-viral proteins. Three size classes of these
enzymes: small (p40, p46), intermediate (p69, p71) and large (p100), are encoded 
by three genes that exhibit differential constitutive and IFN-inducible
expression. Since the 5'-regulatory region of the 69 kDa isoform contains
multiple putative control elements, deletion analysis and site directed
mutagenesis were done to identify key regulatory motifs. The region located
between bp -972 and -452 from the translational start site contains elements that
slightly repress constitutive and IFN-inducible transcription. The region from bp
-366 to -117 contains two positive regulatory elements that differ slightly from 
consensus IFN-regulated factor 1 (IRF-1) binding sites. In mobility shift assays,
the proximal IRF-1 site weakly binds a novel factor found in both control and
IFN-treated cells. The region from bp -117 to -10 contains a functional
interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) that contributes to constitutive
expression and confers IFN-inducibility on a heterologous promoter. The ISRE
specifically binds an IFN-inducible factor that contains signal transducer
activator of transcription (STAT) 1alpha. The ISRE and the two IRF-1-like sites
cooperatively interact to control transcription. These three elements are
sufficient for constitutive and IFN-inducible expression, since expression from
reporter constructs containing mutations in all three elements is low in both
control and IFN-treated cells.

Cytokines and steroid hormones use different sets of signal transduction
pathways, which seem to be unrelated. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) uses JAK tyrosine
kinase and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription 
factor. Glucocorticoid binds glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is a member of
the steroid receptor superfamily. We have studied the crosstalk between the
IL-6-JAK-STAT and glucocorticoid-nuclear receptor pathways. IL-6 and
glucocorticoid synergistically activated the IL-6 response element on the rat
alpha2-macroglobulin promoter (APRE)-driven luciferase gene. The exogenous
expression of GR enhanced the synergism. The exogenous expression of dominant
negative STAT3 completely abolished the IL-6 plus glucocorticoid-induced
activation of the APRE-luciferase gene. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3
stimulated by IL-6 alone was not different from that by IL-6 plus glucocorticoid.
The protein level of STAT3 was also not increased by glucocorticoid stimulation. 
The time course of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by IL-6 plus glucocorticoid was
not different from that by IL-6 alone. The synergism was studied on the two other
IL-6 response elements, the junB promoter (JRE-IL-6) and the interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) promoter (IRF-GAS) which could be activated by STAT3.
The synergistic activation by glucocorticoid on the IL-6-activated JRE-IL-6 and
the IRF-GAS-driven luciferase gene was not detected. Glucocorticoid did not
change the mobility of IL-6-induced APRE-binding proteins in a gel shift assay.
These results suggest that the synergism was through the GR and STAT3, and the
coactivation pathway which was specific for APRE was the target of
glucocorticoid.

p48/STAT-1alpha-containing complexes play a predominant role in induction of
IFN-gamma-inducible protein, 10 kDa (IP-10) by IFN-gamma alone or in synergy with
TNF-alpha.

Foundation, OH 44195, USA.

Human IFN-gamma-inducible protein, 10 kDa (hIP-10) and murine IP-10 (mIP-10)
genes are induced by IFN-gamma alone, and synergistically induced by TNF-alpha
and IFN-gamma. Upstream regions of the human and murine genes contain conserved
regulatory motifs, including an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), which
governs response of the mIP-10 gene to IFN-gamma. Trans-acting factors mediating 
the IFN-gamma response via ISRE remain incompletely defined. We examined
ISRE-binding factors in the regulation of the hIP-10 gene. The requirement of p48
for hIP-10 induction by IFN-gamma, with or without TNF-alpha, was demonstrated
using p48-deficient U2A cells. An hIP-10 promoter-reporter mutant (mISRE3) that
was relatively deficient for binding a related factor, IFN regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) but competent for binding p48, was induced as well as the wild-type
hIP-10 promoter, supporting the interpretation that p48 played a necessary and
sufficient role in hIP-10 transcription. Genomic in vivo footprinting revealed
IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha-inducible binding at the ISRE consistent with the presence of
p48 and associated factors, but not with IRF-1. Induction of hIP-10 by
TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma also required NFkappaB binding sites, which were protected in
vivo and bound p65 homodimeric NFkappaB in vitro. These results documented the
essential role of p48 (complexed with STAT-1alpha) for induction and sustained
transcription of the IP-10 gene, strongly suggesting that IRF-1 is not required
for IP-10 induction by these inflammatory cytokines.

Exploring functional redundancy in the immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain gene
enhancer.

Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02254, USA.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) mu heavy-chain gene enhancer activity is mediated by multiple
DNA binding proteins. Mutations of several protein binding sites in the enhancer 
do not affect enhancer activity significantly. This feature, termed redundancy,
is thought to be due to functional compensation of the mutated sites by other
elements within the enhancer. In this study, we identified the elements that make
the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein binding sites, muE2 and muE3,
redundant. The major compensatory element is a binding site for interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs) and not one of several other bHLH protein binding
sites. These studies also provide the first evidence for a role of IRF proteins
in Ig heavy-chain gene expression. In addition, we reconstituted the activity of 
a monomeric mu enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and defined the domains of the ETS
gene required for function.

In order to understand the molecular basis of the synergistic action of
interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) on rat 
oligodendrocyte development, we studied some aspects of the signalling pathways
involved in the regulation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I 
and the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene expression. Two well-defined 
inducible enhancers of the MHC class I gene promoter, the MHC class I regulatory 
element (MHC-CRE) and the interferon consensus sequence (ICS), were analysed.
Neither IFN-gamma nor TNF-alpha was capable of inducing MHC-CRE binding activity 
when administrated alone. Following the exposure of oligodendrocytes to
IFN-gamma, TNF-R1 expression was transcriptionally induced by the binding of
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1) homodimers to the
IFN-gamma activated site (GAS) present in the gene promoter. The upregulation of 
TNF-R1 allowed TNF-alpha to induce the binding of nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-kappaB) to the MHC-CRE site. With respect to ICS element, IFN-gamma induced
IRF-1 binding, that was further enhanced upon co-treatment with TNF-alpha. The
existence of a synergism between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in stimulating IRF-1
expression at the transcriptional level was supported by IRF-1 promoter analysis:
IFN-gamma directly induced the binding of STAT-1 homodimers to the GAS element,
while NF-kappaB binding to the kappaB sequence was activated by TNF-alpha only
after IFN-gamma treatment. This transcriptional regulation of IRF-1 gene by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was confirmed at the mRNA level. The synergism
demonstrated in the present study highlights the importance of cytokine
interactions in magnifying their biological effects during brain injury and
inflammation.

Retinoic acid (RA) and interferons (IFN) are negative regulators of cell
proliferation. A number of clinical trials were thus carried out in cancer
therapy with RA and/or IFN. In vitro and in vivo, their combination leads to a
more potent cell growth inhibition. Moreover, RA and IFN act cooperatively to
increase the expression of many IFN-stimulated genes, leading also to a higher
cell differentiation and inhibition of viral replication. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which RA and IFN potentiate each other are not fully understood.
The cooperative effects by RA and IFN are mediated through multiple pathways. RA 
causes the induction and secretion of IFN alpha. RA also stimulates the IFN
regulatory factor gene expression (IRF1 and p48). Additional mechanisms could be 
involved as RA increases the level of signal transducing activators of
transcription (Stat) proteins, and thus enhances the IFN-induced Stat activation.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors 
among which are IRF-1, IRF-2, and IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP).
These factors share sequence homology in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. IRF-1
and IRF-2 are further related and have additional homologous sequences within
their C-termini. Whereas IRF-2 and ICSBP are identified as transcriptional
repressors, IRF-1 is an activator. In the present work, the identification of
functional domains in murine IRF-1 with regard to DNA-binding, nuclear
translocation, heterodimerization with ICSBP and transcriptional activation are
demonstrated. The minimal DNA-binding domain requires the N-terminal 124 amino
acids plus an arbitrary C-terminal extension. By using mutants of IRF-1 fusion
proteins with green fluorescent protein and monitoring their distribution in
living cells, a nuclear location signal (NLS) was identified and found to be
sufficient for nuclear translocation. Heterodimerization was confirmed by a
two-hybrid system adapted to mammalian cells. The heterodimerization domain in
IRF-1 was defined by studies in vitro and was shown to be homologous with a
sequence in IRF-2, suggesting that IRF-2 also heterodimerizes with ICSBP through 
this sequence. An acidic domain in IRF-1 was found to be required and to be
sufficient for transactivation. Epitope mapping of IRF-1 showed that regions
within the NLS, the heterodimerization domain and the transcriptional activation 
domain are exposed for possible contacts with interacting proteins.

Lipopolysaccharide and ceramide use divergent signaling pathways to induce cell
death in murine macrophages.

Lakics V(1), Vogel SN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of
the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.

Ceramide is a well-known apoptotic agent that has been implicated in LPS
signaling. Therefore, we examined whether LPS-induced macrophage cytotoxicity is 
mediated by mimicking ceramide. Both LPS and the cell-permeable ceramide
analogue, C2 ceramide, induced significant cell death in IFN-gamma-activated,
thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages after 48 and 24 h, respectively.
Ceramide-induced cell death was neither accompanied by DNA fragmentation nor
phosphatidyl serine externalization, characteristics of apoptosis. In contrast,
LPS induced a significant fraction of cells to undergo apoptosis, as demonstrated
by DNA fragmentation and quantified by DNA analysis on FACS, yet the majority of 
the cells died in a necrotic fashion. C3H/HeJ Lps(d) macrophages were resistant
to LPS-induced cell death and less sensitive to C2 ceramide-evoked cytotoxicity, 
when compared with Lps(n) macrophages. C2 ceramide plus IFN-gamma failed to
activate release of nitric oxide (NO.), whereas LPS-induced cell death, but not
C2-induced cytotoxicity, was blocked by an inhibitor of inducible NO. synthase
(iNOS), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Macrophages from IFN regulatory factor-1 (-/-) 
mice shown previously to respond marginally to LPS plus IFN-gamma to express iNOS
mRNA and NO., were refractory to LPS plus IFN-gamma-induced cytotoxicity and
apoptosis. These data suggest that although LPS may mimic certain ceramide
effects, signal transduction events that lead to cytotoxicity, as well as the
downstream mediators, diverge.

Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occurs in many
tumors and in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis for treatment. Here,
we report that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) induces EGFR promoter
activity up to 200-fold compared to 3-10-fold induction by other regulators. The 
region of the promoter that is required for this induction was defined using
deletion mutants. In addition, we found that IRF-1 and tricostatin A, a
deacetylase inhibitor, have a synergistic effect on EGFR promoter activity. This 
indicates that the increase in EGFR promoter activity by IRF-1 may also involve
changes in chromatin structure. These results identify IRF-1 as a major regulator
of EGFR gene expression.

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) observed in human tumors strongly suggests the
existence of (a) tumor-suppressor gene(s) at the concerned locus. A series of
studies has revealed that LOH on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) frequently
occurs in differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, it has been shown 
that the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) locus on chromosome 5q31.1 is one
of the common minimal regions of LOH in these cancers. IRF-1 is a transcriptional
activator that shows tumor-suppressor activity in the mouse. In the present
study, we examined the sequence of the IRF-1 gene in 9 cases of histologically
differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas, all of which exhibited LOH at the IRF-1
locus. We identified a mis-sense mutation in the residual allele in one case.
This mutated form of IRF-1 showed markedly reduced transcriptional activity. In
addition, overexpression of wild-type IRF-1 induced cell-cycle arrest, whereas
such activity was attenuated in the mutant IRF-1. These results suggest that the 
loss of functional IRF-1 is critical for the development of human gastric
cancers.

Retinoic acid has antiproliferative and differentiative effects on many cell
types. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA (all-trans retinoic
acid) -dependent growth inhibition and cell differentiation are poorly
understood. On the other hand, several different cytokine specific transcription 
factors such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and
interferon regulatory factors (IRF) are known to be instrumental in mediating
differentiative, growth regulatory and antiproliferative effects in cells. The
IRF family consists of six different proteins, of which IRF-1 has been
demonstrated to have antiproliferative and tumor suppressive functions. We have
shown that ATRA activates IRF-1 gene expression in several myeloid leukemia cell 
lines (HL-60, NB4, THP-1, U937), all of which respond to ATRA by growth
inhibition. In addition, during ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation, gene
expression of STAT1, STAT2, and p48 was upregulated. These proteins are involved 
in IFN-alpha specific signaling. ATRA-induced expression of IRF and/or STAT
transcription factors may be one of the molecular mechanisms mediating growth
inhibition by ATRA.

Recruitment of CBP/p300 by the IFN beta enhanceosome is required for synergistic 
activation of transcription.

Merika M(1), Williams AJ, Chen G, Collins T, Thanos D.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New 
York, New York 10032, USA.

Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection
requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional
activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y). 
The level of transcription generated by all of these activators is greater than
the sum of the levels generated by individual factors, a phenomenon designated
transcriptional synergy. We demonstrate that this synergy, in the context of the 
enhanceosome, requires a new protein-protein interaction domain in the p65
subunit of NF-kappa B. Transcriptional synergy requires recruitment of the
CBP/p300 coactivator to the enhanceosome, via a new activating surface assembled 
from the novel p65 domain and the activation domains of all of the activators.
Deletion, substitution, or rearrangement of any one of the activation domains in 
the context of the enhanceosome decreases both recruitment of CBP and
transcriptional synergy.

p50/p65 of NF-kappa B. Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these
activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG 
I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on
the DNA helix. Analyses of the in vitro assembled enhanceosome revealed that the 
transcriptional synergy is due, at least in part, to the cooperative assembly and
stability of the complex. Reconstitution experiments showed that the formation of
a stable enhanceosome-dependent preinitiation complex require cooperative
interactions between the enhanceosome; the general transcription factors TFID,
TFIIA, and TFIIB; and the cofactor USA. These studies provide a direct
biochemical demonstration of the importance of the structure and function of
natural multicomponent transcriptional enhancer complexes in gene regulation.

IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that modulates the diverse functions of
hepatocytes such as acute phase responses and inflammation. When human hepatoma
cells, Hep3B cells, were treated with IL-6, p140 was phosphorylated rapidly and
reached its maximal rate at 1 min after treatment. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of 
protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, affected IL-6-induced p140 phosphorylation.
Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor on the enhancer 
of type I interferons, and its gene expression is induced by IL-6. When IRF-1
promoter-luciferase construct was transfected into Hep3B cells, okadaic acid
increased IL-6- induced IRF-1 promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of 
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) antisense constructs further increased IL-6-induced
IRF-1 promoter activity, suggesting that PP2A is involved in IL-6 signaling. In
addition, IL-6 directly induced the PP2A phosphorylation. PP2A phosphorylation
was maximal at 1 min after IL-6 stimulation, but it was not induced by other
inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha or TGF-beta. Furthermore, IL-6 activated
PP2A activity simultaneously. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-6
modulates the functions of PP2A which is involved in downstream events of IL-6
signaling in Hep3B.

Regulation of interferon responses in medulloblastoma cells by interferon
regulatory factor-1 and -2.

Transcriptional activator interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and repressor
IRF-2 are known to play a critical role in the regulation of interferon (IFN)
responses and oncogenesis in fibroblasts. Although these two factors are
expressed in many tissues, including the brain, the role of IRFs in the central
nervous system (CNS) has not been elucidated. We analysed a medulloblastoma cell 
line, ONS-76, as a CNS-derived model system and generated its derivatives, R1 and
R2 cells, which constitutively expressed each mouse IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNA at high 
levels. By viral infection, R1 and R2 cells showed IFN-beta gene expression 3 h
earlier than the control ONS-76 (C-76) cells, with 2.46- and 2.24-fold increase
in IFN-beta production respectively. In the presence of cycloheximide, virally
induced IFN-beta gene expression of C-76 cells was suppressed, whereas R1 and R2 
cells produced IFN-beta 7.5- and 2.2-fold higher than C-76 cells respectively. On
the other hand, induction of IFN-inducible genes was enhanced in R1 cells but was
suppressed in R2 cells compared with C-76 cells. These results demonstrate that
IRF-1 and IRF-2 may play an important role in the regulation of IFN-beta and
IFN-inducible genes and that IRF-2 may have dual functions as an activator and
repressor in CNS-derived cells.

Cytomegalovirus activates interferon immediate-early response gene expression and
an interferon regulatory factor 3-containing interferon-stimulated response
element-binding complex.

Author information:

California 92093, USA.

Interferon establishes an antiviral state in numerous cell types through the
induction of a set of immediate-early response genes. Activation of these genes
is mediated by phosphorylation of latent transcription factors of the STAT
family. We found that infection of primary foreskin fibroblasts with human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes selective transcriptional activation of the
alpha/beta-interferon-responsive ISG54 gene. However, no activation or nuclear
translocation of STAT proteins was detected. Activation of ISG54 occurs
independent of protein synthesis but is prevented by protein tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. Further analysis revealed that HCMV infection induced the DNA binding
of a novel complex, tentatively called cytomegalovirus-induced
interferon-stimulated response element binding factor (CIF). CIF is composed, at 
least in part, of the recently identified interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), 
but it does not contain the STAT1 and STAT2 proteins that participate in the
formation of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3. IRF3, which has previously been
shown to possess no intrinsic transcriptional activation potential, interacts
with the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, but not with p300, to 
form CIF. Activating interferon-stimulated genes without the need for prior
synthesis of interferons might provide the host cell with a potential shortcut in
the activation of its antiviral defense.

Interferon enhances tumor necrosis factor-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule
1 (CD106) expression in human endothelial cells by an interferon-related factor
1-dependent pathway.

Vienna Medical School, Vienna, A-1090 Austria.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 are known to initiate endothelial
vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 transcription primarily by activating
nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, which translocates to the nucleus. In addition to two
NF-kappaB elements found within the minimal cytokine-inducible VCAM-1 promoter,
an interferon-related factor (IRF) element (IRF-1) has been identified close to
the transcription initiation site, suggesting that cytokines that induce IRF-1
might affect VCAM-1 expression levels. We therefore investigated the effects of
interferons (IFNs), which strongly induce IRF-1, on VCAM-1 transcription and
expression. We show that IFN-alpha and -gamma enhance TNF-induced VCAM-1 mRNA
transcription and protein expression in human endothelial cells. IFN enhancement 
of TNF-induced expression is also seen using chloramphenicol acetyl transferase
reporter genes linked to the minimal cytokine inducible VCAM-1 promoter. Nuclear 
IRF-1 is the molecular basis of IFN enhancement, because (a) IFN plus TNF-treated
cells displayed increased nuclear IRF-1 levels and increased IRF-1 binding to the
VCAM-1 promoter, compared with cells treated with TNF alone; (b) kinetics of
nuclear IRF-1 levels correlated with VCAM-1 mRNA levels; (c) transfection with an
IRF-1 construct substituted for IFN treatment; and (d) transfection with an
expression construct encoding IRF-2, a competitive inhibitor of IRF-1, reduced
TNF-induced VCAM-1 expression. Our experiments show that IFN amplifies
TNF-induced VCAM-1 expression at the transcriptional level by an IRF-1-dependent 
pathway.

Different requirements for signal transducer and activator of transcription
1alpha and interferon regulatory factor 1 in the regulation of low molecular mass
polypeptide 2 and transporter associated with antigen processing 1 gene
expression.

Chatterjee-Kishore M(1), Kishore R, Hicklin DJ, Marincola FM, Ferrone S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla,
New York 10595, USA.

The components of the antigen processing machinery, low molecular mass
polypeptide (LMP) 2 and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1,
are encoded by closely linked genes within the major histocompatibility complex
class II subregion. Although the two genes share a bi-directional promoter, LMP2 
and TAP1 have differential cellular expression. TAP1 is expressed constitutively.
However, LMP2 expression requires induction by interferon-gamma in most cells.
The regulatory elements within the LMP2/TAP1 promoter and the transcription
factors that bind these elements have been defined. However, how these
transactivators regulate differential TAP1 and LMP2 gene transcription is not
known. We have addressed this question by analyzing three human melanoma cell
lines with distinct phenotypes of LMP2 and TAP1 expression. Whereas binding of
either interferon regulatory factor 1 or Stat1 to the overlapping interferon
consensus sequence-2/GAS is sufficient for regulating transcription of the TAP1
gene, binding of both factors is required for LMP2 gene transcription. This
conclusion is supported by restoration of LMP2 gene transcription following
transfection of wild type Stat1alpha or interferon regulatory factor 1 cDNA into 
cells lacking these transcription factors. The flexibility in the regulation of
the TAP1 gene may reflect its role in maintaining immune surveillance.
Furthermore, lack of LMP2 gene transcription in quiescent human cells suggests
that LMP2 expression reflects a state of cell activation.

Procyanidins extracted from Pinus maritima (Pycnogenol): scavengers of free
radical species and modulators of nitrogen monoxide metabolism in activated
murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.

Nitrogen monoxide (NO) has diverse physiological roles and also contributes to
the immune defense against viruses, bacteria, and other parasites. However,
excess production of NO is associated with various diseases such arthritis,
diabetes, stroke, septic shock, autoimmune, chronic inflammatory diseases, and
atheriosclerosis. Cells respond to activating or depressing stimuli by enhancing 
or inhibiting the expression of the enzymatic machinery that produce NO. Thus,
maintenance of a tight regulation of NO production is important for human health.
Phytochemicals have been traditionally utilized in ways to treat a family of
pathologies that have in common the disregulation of NO production. Here we
report the scavenging activity of Pycnogenol (the polyphenols containing extract 
of the bark from Pinus maritima) against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species,
and its effects on NO metabolism in the murine macrophages cell line RAW 264.7.
Macrophages were activated by the bacterial wall components lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and interferon (IFN-gamma), which induces the expression of large amounts
of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Preincubation of cells with
physiological concentrations of Pycnogenol significantly decreased NO generation.
It was found that this effect was due to the combination of several different
biological activities, i.e., its ROS and NO scavenging activity, inhibition of
iNOS activity, and inhibition of iNOS-mRNA expression. These data begin to
provide the basis for the conceptual understanding of the biological activity of 
Pycnogenol and possibly other polyphenolic compounds as therapeutic agents in
various human disorders.

Interferons (IFNs) are a family of multifunctional cytokines with antiviral
activities. The K9 open reading frame of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus 
(KSHV) exhibits significant homology with cellular IFN regulatory factors (IRFs).
We have investigated the functional consequence of K9 expression in IFN-mediated 
signal transduction. Expression of K9 dramatically repressed transcriptional
activation induced by IFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma. Further, it induced
transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, resulting in morphologic changes, focus
formation, and growth in reduced-serum conditions. The expression of antisense K9
in KSHV-infected BCBL-1 cells consistently increased IFN-mediated transcriptional
activation but drastically decreased the expression of certain KSHV genes. Thus, 
the K9 gene of KSHV encodes the first virus-encoded IRF (v-IRF) which functions
as a repressor for cellular IFN-mediated signal transduction. In addition, v-IRF 
likely plays an important role in regulating KSHV gene expression. These results 
suggest that KSHV employs an unique mechanism to antagonize IFN-mediated
antiviral activity by harboring a functional v-IRF.

The growing family of interferon regulatory factors.

Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Québec, Canada.

Interferons (IFN) exert their multiple biological effects through the induction
of expression of over 30 genes encoding proteins with antiviral,
antiproliferative and immunomodulatory functions. Among the many IFN-inducible
proteins are the Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs), a family of transcription 
regulators, originally consisting of the well-characterized IRF-1 and IRF-2
proteins; the family has now expanded to over 10 members and is still growing.
The present review provides a detailed description of recently characterized IRF 
family members. Studies analyzing IRF-expressing cell lines and IRF knockout mice
reveal that each member of the IRF family exerts distinct roles in biological
processes such as pathogen response, cytokine signalling, cell growth regulation 
and hematopoietic development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which
the IRFs affect these important cellular events and IFN expression will
contribute to a greater understanding of events leading to various viral, immune 
and malignant disease states and will suggest novel strategies for antiviral and 
immune modulatory therapy.

Transforming growth factor-beta 1 stimulates or inhibits cell growth via down- or
up-regulation of p21/Waf1.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) regulates cell proliferation
positively or negatively. The mitoinhibition by TGF-beta has been attributed to
induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, such as p15/ Ink4B,
p27/Kip1, and p21/Waf1 also known as Cip1 and Sdi1. However, the biological
process by which TGF-beta exerts the stimulatory effects on cell growth remains
poorly understood. Here we report that TGF-beta 1 stimulates DNA synthesis of
IMR-90 human embryonic lung fibroblasts but inhibits that of HuCCT1 human
cholangiocarcinoma cells, via down- or up-regulation of p21/Waf1, respectively.
TGF-beta 1 markedly suppresses IMR-90 cells to express two different kinds of the
p21/Waf1 gene transcription factors, the p53 tumor suppressor and the interferon 
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). This is followed by a marked decrease in expression 
of p21/Waf1 in a manner consistent with the timing of activation of cyclin
E-associated kinase, which normally accompanies the G1-S transition in the cell
cycle. Contrarily, TGF-beta 1-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in HuCCT1 cells
is preceded by IRF-1-dependent but p53-independent up-regulation of p21/Waf1
expression followed by inactivation of cyclin E-associated kinase. Thus the cell 
growth stimulation or inhibition by TGF-beta 1 are mediated by the down- or
up-regulation of p21/ Waf1, respectively.

PU.1, interferon regulatory factor 1, and interferon consensus sequence-binding
protein cooperate to increase gp91(phox) expression.

gp91(phox) is a subunit of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase catalytic
unit. Transcription of CYBB, the gene encoding gp91(phox), is restricted to
terminally differentiated phagocytic cells. An element in the proximal CYBB
promoter binds a protein complex, referred to as hematopoiesis-associated factor 
(HAF1), that is necessary for interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-induced gp91(phox)
expression. In these investigations, we determined that HAF1 was a multiprotein
complex, cross-immunoreactive with the transcription factors PU.1, interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein
(ICSBP). In electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the HAF1 complex was
reconstituted by either in vitro translated PU.1 with IRF-1 or PU.1 with ICSBP,
but not by IRF-1 with ICSBP. HAF1a, a slower mobility complex with the same
binding site specificity as HAF1, was also investigated. Similar to the HAF1
complex, the HAF1a complex was cross-immunoreactive with PU. 1, IRF-1, and ICSBP.
Unlike the HAF1 complex, reconstitution of the HAF1a complex required in vitro
translated PU.1 with both IRF-1 and ICSBP. An artificial promoter construct
containing the HAF1/HAF1a binding site was modestly activated in the
myelomonocytic cell line U937 by co-transfection either with PU.1 and IRF-1 or
with PU.1 and ICSBP, but it was strongly activated by co-transfection with PU.1, 
IRF-1, and ICSBP. This activation required serine 148-phosphorylated PU.1. These 
studies describe a novel mechanism for PU.1 transcriptional activation via
interaction with both IRF-1 and ICSBP, a target gene for the interaction of IRF-1
with ICSBP, and a novel activation function for ICSBP as a component of a
multiprotein complex.

Jak2 deficiency defines an essential developmental checkpoint in definitive

Janus kinases (Jaks) play an important role in signal transduction via cytokine
and growth factor receptors. A targeted inactivation of Jak2 was performed.
Jak2-/- embryos are anemic and die around day 12.5 postcoitum. Primitive
erythrocytes are found, but definitive erythropoiesis is absent. Compared to
erythropoietin receptor-deficient mice, the phenotype of Jak2 deficiency is more 
severe. Fetal liver BFU-E and CFU-E colonies are completely absent. However,
multilineage hematopoietic stem cells (CD34low, c-kit(pos)) can be found, and B
lymphopoiesis appears intact. In contrast to IFNalpha stimulation, Jak2-/- cells 
do not respond to IFNgamma. Jak2-/- embryonic stem cells are competent for LIF
signaling. The data provided demonstrate that Jak2 has pivotal functions for
signal transduction of a set of cytokine receptors required in definitive
erythropoiesis.

A variety of cytokines activate receptor-associated members of the Janus family
of protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks). To assess the role of Jak2, we have derived
Jak2-deficient mice. The mutation causes an embryonic lethality due to the
absence of definitive erythropoiesis. Fetal liver myeloid progenitors, although
present based on the expression of lineage specific markers, fail to respond to
erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3 (IL-3), or granulocyte/macrophage
colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, the response to granulocyte specific
colony-stimulating factor is unaffected. Jak2-deficient fibroblasts failed to
respond to interferon gamma (IFNgamma), although the responses to IFNalpha/beta
and IL-6 were unaffected. Lastly, reconstitution experiments demonstrate that
Jak2 is not required for the generation of lymphoid progenitors, their
amplification, or functional differentiation. Therefore, Jak2 plays a critical,
nonredundant role in the function of a specific group of cytokines receptors.

Identification and regulation of testicular interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) receptor 
subunits: IFNgamma enhances interferon regulatory factor-1 and interleukin-1beta 
converting enzyme expression.

Kanzaki M(1), Morris PL.

Author information: 
(1)Population Council, New York, New York 10021, USA.

Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) transmits its signal through a specific cell surface 
receptor (IFNgammaR), which consists of a primary ligand binding alpha-chain
(IFNgammaR alpha) and a signaling beta-chain (IFNgammaR beta). Recent studies
identified the cytokines IFNgamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1alpha, and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha in testicular cells. Therefore, we: 1) examined the
expression of IFNgammaR alpha and IFNgammaR beta subunits in freshly isolated and
purified rat testicular cells; 2) examined the differential regulation of
receptor components by cytokines using primary cultures of Sertoli cells; 3)
identified the cell signaling pathway components of testicular IFNgammaR; and 4) 
characterized the functional role of testicular IFNgamma using primary Sertoli
cells. We demonstrated the messenger RNAs for both chains of IFNgammaR in rat
testicular cells using Northern hybridization analysis. Western blot analysis and
immunocytochemistry showed that both specific IFNgammaR protein subunits were
present in cultured primary Leydig and Sertoli cells prepared from the testes of 
immature rats. The expression of both IFNgammaR component messenger RNAs in
cultured Sertoli cells was increased by its specific ligand (IFNgamma), as well
as IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in both a time- and dose-dependent 
manner. IFNgamma-activation of the Janus (JAK) tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2
proteins, indicate that IFNgammaR, expressed in the Sertoli cell, is functional. 
Moreover, IFNgamma modulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor
(IRF)-1 and IL-1beta converting enzyme genes in Sertoli cells. Thus, our data are
suggestive of a role(s) for IFN-gamma in the regulation of distinct gene
expression and cell-specific sensitivity to apoptosis in the testis.

The ril gene encoding a LIM domain protein of an unknown function was previously 
identified by differential expression cloning as a candidate tumor suppressor
gene in rat fibroblasts (Kiess, M., Scharm, B., Aguzzi, A., Hajnal, A., Klemenz, 
R., Schwarte-Waldhoff, I., Schafer, R., 1995. Expression of ril, a novel LIM
domain gene, is down-regulated in HRAS-transformed cells and restored in
phenotypic revertants. Oncogene 10, 61-68). Searching for novel genes on human
chromosome 5q31.1 by the cDNA selection technique, we isolated a cDNA clone
identical with the cDNA of the human RIL gene (GenBank Accession No. X93510). The
human 5q31.1 region is of interest because it contains the cytokine gene cluster 
and is frequently deleted in the malignant cells of patients with myelodysplasia 
and myeloid leukemia. Using Southern blot analysis and restriction mapping of
genomic YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) and cosmid clones, we located the human
RIL gene 240-260 kb telomeric to the IRF1 gene and characterized its genomic
structure. PCR analysis indicated the presence of two alternative RIL transcripts
in human fetal brain mRNA. The major transcript is identical with the RIL cDNA
previously deposited in GenBank and contains seven exons distributed over 14.5 kb
of genomic DNA with the two last 3'-exons coding a LIM domain. The minor
transcript lacks the sixth exon compared with the major transcript, which leads
to the loss of the LIM domain. We also identified two putative transcription
start points (tsp) and sequenced the 5'-flanking region of RIL to reveal
potential binding sites for transcriptional factors.

Lack of 2',5'-oligoadenylate-dependent RNase expression in the human hepatoma
cell line HepG2.

Tnani M(1), Bayard BA.

Author information: 
(1)UMR 5539 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Université de
Montpellier II, France.

2',5'-adenylate oligonucleotide (2-5A)-dependent RNase and 2-5A-synthetase are
two enzymes of the 2-5A system strongly implicated in the basal control of RNA
decay of both interferon-treated and untreated cells. RNase is activated by a
2-5A produced by 2-5A-synthetase, both enzymes being overexpressed by type
I-interferon (alpha/beta). We described here for the first time a cell line
completely deficient in RNase and its mRNA, while p69 2-5A-synthetase was
normally interferon alpha/beta-induced. The complete absence of this RNase in
human hepatoma cells (HepG2) was shown using three different methods based on the
binding of a [32P]-labeled 2-5A probe of high specific activity to its binding
site. Negative Western blotting assay with a specific monoclonal antibody
correlated the previous findings. RNase-specific mRNA was not detectable even
after treatment of cells with 1000 units/ml of interferon alpha/beta. This is not
due to a mutation of the gene because an intronless genomic DNA sequence encoding
2-5A-binding site was cloned and expressed. It is likely that the expression of
2-5A-dependent RNase was impaired at the transcriptional level while having the
known IFN alpha/beta-transcriptional regulatory factors as revealed by induction 
of p69 2-5A-synthetase gene. This may account for a differential activation of
2-5A-dependent RNase and 2-5A-synthetase genes by type I-interferon, and suggests
that other members of regulatory transcription factors, different from IRF-1 and 
STAT proteins, may participate in two different interferon alpha/beta signaling
pathways.

Respiratory syncytial virus infection of human alveolar epithelial cells enhances
interferon regulatory factor 1 and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme gene
expression but does not cause apoptosis.

The induction kinetics of the transcriptional activities of interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1), interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), and CPP32 by
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection of human type II alveolar epithelial 
cells (A549 cells) were analyzed semiquantitatively by reverse transcriptase PCR.
The appearance of ICE and CPP32 protein in cell lysate was examined by Western
blotting analysis. The induction of apoptosis by RSV infection was examined by
the appearance of DNA fragmentation detected by terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling. RSV
moderately enhanced IRF-1 mRNA as early as 4 h after infection, and this
enhancement lasted several hours. Following induction of the IRF-1 gene, ICE gene
expression increased significantly, and an increase of ICE protein was observed
in the RSV-infected cell lysate. These increments were observed in cells treated 
with live RSV but not in cells treated with inactivated RSV or control antigen.
However, no infection-specific increase of CPP32 gene expression or the protein
was observed. No nucleosomal fragmentation was observed in RSV-infected cells
during the whole course of infection, despite the appearance of extensive
cytopathic change and cell death. These observations suggest that RSV infection
of human alveolar epithelial cells induces the ICE gene and its protein as a
result of increased IRF-1 induction but that the increased ICE was insufficient
to cause apoptosis in the RSV-infected cells. ICE might not be able to activate
CPP32, which is thought to be the more important protease for apoptosis.

Spontaneous resorption in the CBA x DBA/2 model is attributed to NK cells,
macrophages, and Th1-type cytokines. In vivo depletion of NK cells by
anti-asialoGM1 Ab or macrophage depletion by silicon dioxide treatment reduced
abortion rates, which could no longer be boosted by injecting TNF-alpha (which
activates NK cells) or IFN-gamma (which activates macrophages). TNF-alpha +
gamma-IFN coadministration aborted >80% of the embryos whether or not NK cells or
macrophages had been depleted or estradiol + progesterone was injected to correct
potential reduction in ovarian function by cytokines. The cytokines also aborted 
IRF1+/+ C57BL/6 but not IRF1-/- females pregnant by IRF1+/+ DBA/2. Both
spontaneous and cytokine-boosted abortions in CBA x DBA/2 were blocked by Ab to
fgl2 prothrombinase [corrected] expressed by cytokine-stimulated vascular
endothelial cells and monocytes; in vivo Ab depletion of granulocytes also
prevented TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma-induced abortions. Cytokine-triggered
thrombotic/inflammatory processes in maternal uteroplacental blood vessels causes
abortion.

The integrated activities of IRF-2 (HiNF-M), CDP/cut (HiNF-D) and H4TF-2 (HiNF-P)
regulate transcription of a cell cycle controlled human histone H4 gene:
mechanistic differences between distinct H4 genes.

Maximal transcription of a prototypical cell cycle controlled histone H4 gene
requires a proliferation-specific in vivo genomic protein/DNA interaction
element, Site II. Three sequence-specific transcription factors interact with
overlapping recognition motifs within Site II: interferon regulatory factor IRF-2
(HiNF-M), the putative H4 subtype-specific protein H4TF-2 (HiNF-P), and HiNF-D
which represents a complex of the homeodomain protein CDP/cut, CDC2, cyclin A and
pRB. However, natural sequence variation in the Site II sequences of different
human H4 genes abolishes binding of specific trans-acting factors; the functional
consequences of these variations have not been investigated. To address the
precise contribution of H4 promoter factors to the level of H4 gene
transcription, we performed a systematic mutational analysis of Site II
transcriptional motifs. These mutants were tested for ability to bind each of the
Site II cognate proteins, and subsequently evaluated for ability to confer H4
transcriptional activity using chimeric H4 promoter/CAT fusion constructs in
different cell types. We also analyzed the effect of over-expressing IRF-2 on CAT
reporter gene expression driven by mutant H4 promoters and assessed H4
transcriptional control in cells nullizygous for IRF-1 and IRF-2. Our results
show that the recognition sequence for IRF-2 (HiNF-M) is the dominant component
of Site II and modulates H4 gene transcription levels by 3 fold. However, the
overlapping recognition sequences for IRF-2 (HiNF-M), H4TF-2 (HiNF-P) and CDP/cut
(HiNF-D) together modulate H4 gene transcription levels by at least an order of
magnitude. Thus, maximal activation of H4 gene transcription during the cell
cycle in vivo requires the integrated activities of multiple transcription
factors at Site II. We postulate that the composite organization of Site II
supports responsiveness to multiple signalling pathways modulating the activities
of H4 gene transcription factors during the cell cycle. Variations in Site II
sequences among different H4 genes may accommodate differential regulation of H4 
gene expression in cells and tissues with unique phenotypic properties.

STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a key transcription
factor mediating the signals for a variety of cytokines, including interleukin-6 
(IL-6). The Stat3 gene itself is activated by IL-6 signals. We show that the
region of the signal-transducing subunit, gp130, essential for STAT3 activation, 
is also required for activation of the Stat3 gene. To elucidate the mechanisms
activating the Stat3 gene, we identified an IL-6 response element (IL-6RE) in the
Stat3 gene promoter containing both a low affinity STAT3-binding element and a
cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that 
IL-6 induced a slowly migrating complex on the IL-6RE containing a STAT3
homodimer and an unidentified CRE-binding protein. With the combination of
transient transfection assays using mutant Stat3 promoter-reporter constructs and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we found that the formation of a slowly
migrating complex was required for full activation of the Stat3 gene. Thus, STAT3
activates the Stat3 gene in cooperation with an unidentified CRE-binding protein.
This regulatory mechanism is similar to that of the junB gene, which is activated
by IL-6 through the junB IL-6RE, which contains a low affinity STAT3-binding site
and a CRE-like site.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is important
during the maturation of natural killer 1.1+ T cell receptor-alpha/beta+ (NK1+ T)

In contrast to conventional T cells, natural killer (NK) 1.1+ T cell receptor
(TCR)-alpha/beta+ (NK1+T) cells, NK cells, and intestinal intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs) bearing CD8-alpha/alpha chains constitutively express the
interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (R)beta/15Rbeta chain. Recent studies have indicated 
that IL-2Rbeta/15Rbeta chain is required for the development of these lymphocyte 
subsets, outlining the importance of IL-15. In this study, we investigated the
development of these lymphocyte subsets in interferon regulatory factor
1-deficient (IRF-1-/-) mice. Surprisingly, all of these lymphocyte subsets were
severely reduced in IRF-1-/- mice. Within CD8-alpha/alpha+ intestinal IEL subset,
TCR-gamma/delta+ cells and TCR-alpha/beta+ cells were equally affected by IRF
gene disruption. In contrast to intestinal TCR-gamma/delta+ cells, thymic
TCR-gamma/delta+ cells developed normally in IRF-1-/- mice. Northern blot
analysis further revealed that the induction of IL-15 messenger RNA was impaired 
in IRF-1-/- bone marrow cells, and the recovery of these lymphocyte subsets was
observed when IRF-1-/- cells were cultured with IL-15 in vitro. These data
indicate that IRF-1 regulates IL-15 gene expression, which may control the
development of NK1+T cells, NK cells, and CD8-alpha/alpha+ IELs.

Human cytomegalovirus inhibits major histocompatibility complex class II
expression by disruption of the Jak/Stat pathway.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that is able to persist 
for decades in its host. HCMV has evolved protean countermeasures for anti-HCMV
cellular immunity that facilitate establishment of persistence. Recently it has
been shown that HCMV inhibits interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-stimulated MHC class
II expression, but the mechanism for this effect is unknown. IFN-gamma signal
transduction (Jak/Stat pathway) and class II transactivator (CIITA) are required 
components for IFN-gamma-stimulated MHC class II expression. In this study, we
demonstrate that both a clinical isolate and a laboratory strain of HCMV inhibit 
inducible MHC class II expression at the cell surface and at RNA level in human
endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Moreover, reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction and Northern blot analyses demonstrate that neither CIITA nor
interferon regulatory factor 1 are upregulated in infected cells. Electrophoretic
mobility shift assays reveal a defect in IFN-gamma signal transduction, which was
shown by immunoprecipitation to be associated with a striking decrease in Janus
kinase 1 (Jak1) levels. Proteasome inhibitor studies with
carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine vinyl sulfone suggest an HCMV-associated
enhancement of Jak1 protein degradation. This is the first report of a mechanism 
for the HCMV-mediated disruption of inducible MHC class II expression and a
direct virus-associated alteration in Janus kinase levels. These findings are yet
another example of the diverse mechanisms by which HCMV avoids immunosurveillance
and establishes persistence.

Interferon-gamma and interleukin-6 inhibit proliferation in human melanoma cells 
by different signalling pathways.

Fontaine V(1), Mahieu M, Content J.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratoire de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, Bruxelles, Belgium.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a cell growth inhibitor, induced by
cytokines, which transactivates downstream effector genes. The role of IRF-1 in
the antiproliferative effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was investigated using the
A375 human melanoma cell line. IL-6 is a stronger inhibitor of A375 proliferation
compared with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma). However, in contrast to IFNgamma, IL-6
triggered lower IRF-1 DNA binding activity and induced barely detectable
IRF-1-dependent transactivation activity. Furthermore, although IFNgamma induces 
only activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1,
IL-6 activates mainly STAT3. These data suggest that IRF-1 plays a minor role in 
the antiproliferative effect of IL-6, which uses alternative signalling events to
induce growth inhibition in A375 melanoma cells.

Genetics of host resistance and susceptibility to intramacrophage pathogens: a
study of multicase families of tuberculosis, leprosy and leishmaniasis in
north-eastern Brazil.

Genetic analysis of disease phenotypes segregating in recombinant inbred,
congenic and recombinant haplotype mouse strains permitted us to effectively
"scan" the murine genome for genes controlling resistance and susceptibility to
leishmanial infections. Five major regions were implicated which, because they
show conserved synteny with regions of the human genome, immediately provide
candidate gene regions for human disease susceptibility genes. A common
intramacrophage niche for leishmanial and mycobacterial pathogens, and a similar 
spectrum of immune response and disease phenotypes, also led to the prediction
that the same genes/candidate gene regions might be responsible for genetic
susceptibility to mycobacterial infections such as leprosy and tuberculosis.
Indeed, one of the murine genes (Nramp1) was identified for its role in
controlling a range of intramacrophage pathogens, including leishmanial,
salmonella and mycobacterial infections. In recent studies, multicase families of
visceral leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and leprosy, from north-eastern Brazil have 
been analysed to determine the role of these candidate genes/regions in humans.
Complex segregation analysis provides evidence for one or two major genes
controlling susceptibility to these diseases in this population. Family-based
linkage analyses (e.g., combined segregation and linkage analysis; sib-pair
analyses) and transmission disequilibrium testing have been used to examine the
role of four regions in disease susceptibility and/or immune response phenotypes.
Results to date demonstrate: (1) the major histocompatibility complex (MHC:H-2 in
mouse, HLA in humans: mouse chromosome 17/human 6p; candidates class II and class
III including tumour necrosis factor alpha/beta genes) shows both linkage to, and
allelic association with, leprosy per se, but is only weakly associated with
visceral leishmaniasis and shows neither linkage to, nor allelic association
with, tuberculosis; (2) no evidence for linkage between NRAMP1, the positionally 
cloned candidate for the murine macrophage resistance gene Ity/Lsh/Bcg (mouse
chromosome 1/human 2q35), and susceptibility to tuberculosis or visceral
leishmaniasis; (3) the region of human chromosome 17q (candidates NOS2A, SCYA2-5)
homologous with distal mouse chromosome 11 is linked to tuberculosis
susceptibility; and (4) the "T helper 2" cytokine gene cluster (proximal murine
chromosome 11/human 5p; candidates IL4, IL5, IL9, IRF1, CD14) is not linked to
human disease susceptibility for any of the three infections, but shows linkage
to and highly significant allelic association with ability to mount an immune
response to mycobacterial antigens. The demonstration of an allelic association
between IL4 and immune response to mycobacterial antigen may provide a genetic
explanation for the inverse association recently demonstrated between delayed
hypersensitivity T helper 1 responses to mycobacterial antigen and atopic
disorder in Japanese children. These studies demonstrate that the
"mouse-to-human" strategy, refined by our knowledge of the human immune response 
to infection, can lead to the identification of important candidate gene regions 
in humans.

Ten years have passed since the molecular cloning of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in
1986. IL-6 is a typical cytokine, exhibiting functional pleiotropy and
redundancy. IL-6 is involved in the immune response, inflammation, and
hematopoiesis. The IL-6 receptor consists of an IL-6 binding alpha chain and a
signal transducer, gp130, which is shared among the receptors for the IL-6
related cytokine subfamily. The sharing of a receptor subunit is a general
feature of cytokine receptors and provides the molecular basis for the functional
redundancy of cytokines. JAK tyrosine kinase is a key molecule that can initiate 
multiple signal-transduction pathways by inducing the tyrosine-phosphorylation of
the cytokine receptor, gp130 in the case of IL-6, on which several signaling
molecules are recruited, including STAT, a signal transducer and activator of
transcription, and SHP-2, which links to the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. JAK can also
directly activate signaling molecules such as STAT and Tec. These multiple
signal-transduction pathways intimately regulate the expression of several genes 
including c-myc, c-myb, junB, IRF1, egr-1, and bcl-2, leading to the induction of
cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The deregulated expression of IL-6
and its receptor is involved in a variety of diseases.

Growth hormone stimulates interferon regulatory factor-1 gene expression in the
liver.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor first identified
as part of the nuclear response to interferons. IRF-1 has been shown to be
activated by many cytokines, including PRL, and has been thought to play a role
in PRL-regulated gene expression in several experimental systems, including the
Nb2 T lymphoma cell line, where it was first characterized as a PRL-responsive
gene. We now find that IRF-1 gene expression is rapidly activated in vivo by both
PRL and GH treatment. A single i.p. injection of rat PRL to hypophysectomized
female rats caused a transient increase in nascent hepatic nuclear IRF-1 RNA
within 15 min of hormone treatment. The rise in IRF-1 transcripts was accompanied
by induction of nuclear protein binding to a DNA element from the proximal IRF-1 
promoter, as assessed by gel mobility shift assays; this element was shown
previously to mediate PRL-activated gene transcription. GH treatment stimulated a
greater and more sustained increase in nascent IRF-1 RNA than PRL, leading to
accumulation of IRF-1 transcripts for up to 16 h after a single hormone
injection. GH also caused a pronounced induction of hepatic nuclear protein
binding to the IRF-1 promoter element. Supershift experiments with specific
antibodies showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
and to a lesser extent STAT3 were components of the GH-activated protein-DNA
complexes. By contrast, these two STATs were not induced in the liver by PRL.
Protein binding to the IRF-1 DNA element and IRF-1 gene activation by GH were not
blunted by pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide,
indicating that these hormonal effects are primary consequences of GH-activated
signal transduction pathways. Our results identify another component of the rapid
nuclear response to GH, and support the idea that multiple primary and secondary 
signaling pathways contribute to the acute actions of GH on gene expression.

Activation of the MHC class II transactivator CIITA by interferon-gamma requires 
cooperative interaction between Stat1 and USF-1.

Author information: 
(1)Louis Jeantet Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Department of Genetics and
Microbiology, University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland.

CIITA is the mediator of MHC class II gene induction by interferon-gamma
(IFNgamma). The CIITA gene is itself selectively activated via one of its four
promoters (PIV). We show here that three cis-acting elements, the GAS, the E box,
and the IRF-1-binding site, as well as the transacting factors Stat1 and IRF-1,
are essential for activation of CIITA promoter IV by IFNgamma. Stat1 binds to the
GAS site only in the presence of the ubiquitous factor USF-1, which binds to the 
adjacent E box. Indeed, Stat1 and USF-1 bind to the GAS/E box motif in a
cooperative manner. The specificity for CIITA activation by IFNgamma is thus
dictated by the GAS/E box motif and by the selective interaction of
IFNgamma-activated Stat1 and USF-1. This clarifies the missing link in the
overall pathway of IFNgamma activation of MHC-II expression.

Natural killer (NK) cells are critical for both innate and adaptive immunity. The
development of NK cells requires interactions between their progenitors and the
bone-marrow microenvironment; however, little is known about the molecular nature
of such interactions. Mice that do not express the transcription factor
interferon-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1; such mice are IRF-1(-/-) mice) have been
shown to exhibit a severe NK-cell deficiency. Here we demonstrate that the lack
of IRF-1 affects the radiation-resistant cells that constitute the
microenvironment required for NK-cell development, but not the NK-cell
progenitors themselves. We also show that IRF-1(-/-) bone-marrow cells can
generate functional NK cells when cultured with the cytokine interleukin-15 and
that the interleukin-15 gene is transcriptionally regulated by IRF-1. These
results reveal, for the first time, a molecular mechanism by which the
bone-marrow microenvironment supports NK-cell development.

In murine macrophages, inducible NO synthase II (iNOS or NOS-II) is induced at
the transcriptional level by IFN-gamma, alone or synergistically with LPS. We
investigated the possible role of reactions of ADP-ribosylation in triggering the
signaling pathways involved in NOS-II gene expression. Stimulation with IFN-gamma
and/or LPS of RAW 264.7 macrophages, transiently transfected with the NOS-II
promoter, was inhibited by ADP-ribosylation inhibitors, indicating that they
interfered with the signal(s) responsible for NOS-II gene transcription. We
therefore explored the effect of these inhibitors on the activity of IRF-1 and NF
kappa B transcription factors known to be involved in NOS-II induction by
IFN-gamma and LPS. No effect was observed on IRF-1 activation. However, NF kappa 
B binding to its target sequence diminished and transfection experiments with an 
NF kappa B-driven reporter plasmid demonstrating that ADP-ribosylation inhibitors
suppressed NF kappa B-dependent promoter activity. These results provide evidence
that a step involving ADP-ribosylation is required to activate NF kappa
B-mediated gene transcription.

Regulation of type I interferon gene expression by interferon regulatory
factor-3.

Author information: 
(1)Oncology Center, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.

The genes of the family of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF) encode DNA
binding transcriptional factors that are involved in modulation of transcription 
of IFN and interferon-induced genes (ISG). The presence of IRF binding sites in
the promoter region of IFNA and IFNB genes indicates that IRF factors recognizing
these sites play an important role in the virus-mediated induction of these
genes. We have described a novel human gene of this family, IRF-3, that is
constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types. IRF-3 binds to the
interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) present in the ISG15 gene promoter
and activates its transcriptional activity. In the present study, we examined
whether IRF-3 can modulate transcriptional activity of IFNA and IFNB promoter
regions. Our results demonstrate that IRF-3 can bind to the IRF-like binding
sites present in the virus-inducible region of the IFNA4 promoter and to the
PRDIII region of the IFNB promoter but cannot alone stimulate their
transcriptional activity in the human cell line, 293. However, the fusion protein
generated from the IRF-3 binding domain and the RelA(p65) activation domain
effectively activates both IFNA4 and IFNB promoters. Cotransfection of IRF-3 and 
RelA(p65) expression plasmids activates the IFNB gene promoter but not the
promoter of IFNA4 gene that does not contain the NF-kB binding site.
Surprisingly, activation of the IFNA4 gene promoter by virus and IRF-1 in these
cells was inhibited by IRF-3. These data indicate that in 293 cells IRF-3 does
not stimulate expression of IFN genes but can cooperate with RelA(p65) to
stimulate the IFNB promoter.

Altered DNA repair and dysregulation of p53 in IRF-1 null hepatocytes.

s.prost@ed.ac.uk

The tumor suppressor proteins IRF-1 and p53 are involved in response pathways
after DNA damage. In different cell types, IRF-1 and p53 can cooperate to produce
cell cycle arrest (embryo fibroblasts) or can independently trigger apoptosis
(lymphoid cells). p53 may also regulate DNA repair, but there is no information
on IRF-1 and repair. The cell lineage dependency of these effects precludes
extrapolation of findings to other tissues of relevance to human cancer. Here, we
report the consequences of IRF-1 deficiency for apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and
DNA repair in primary hepatocytes after DNA damage and extend previous work on
the role of p53 in hepatocytes. IRF-1-deficient hepatocytes showed reduced DNA
repair activity compared with wild-type, as assessed by unscheduled DNA synthesis
after UV irradiation (10J/m2) and by host reactivation of a UV-damaged reporter
construct. p53-deficient hepatocytes also showed reduced unscheduled DNA
synthesis after UV, but there was no impairment of specific repair in host
reactivation assays. IRF-1 deficiency did not affect the p53-dependent G1/S
arrest after UV irradiation. Hepatocyte apoptosis after UV treatment, previously 
reported to be independent of p53, was also independent of IRF-1. However, IRF-1 
deficiency produced dysregulation of p53, manifested as increased transactivation
of a p53-reporter plasmid in undamaged hepatocytes, and accelerated p53
stabilization after DNA damage. Hence, in hepatocytes, IRF-1 is not required for 
growth arrest or apoptosis after DNA damage, but the results suggest for the
first time a role in DNA repair regulation.

The detailed mechanism which governs the choice between herpes simplex virus
(HSV) latency and reactivation remains to be elucidated. It is probable that
altered expression of cellular factors in sensory neurons leads to induction of
HSV gene expression resulting in reactivation. As an approach to identify novel
cellular genes which are activated or repressed by stimuli that reactivate HSV
from latency and hence may play a role in viral reactivation, RNA from explanted 
trigeminal ganglia (TG) was analyzed by differential display reverse
transcription-PCR (DDRT-PCR). Nearly 50 cDNAs whose mRNA level was modified by
the stress of explantation were isolated and sequenced. We present a listing of a
spectrum of altered RNAs, including both known and unknown sequences. Five of
those differentially displayed transcripts were identified as interferon-related 
murine TIS7 mRNA. These results were confirmed in both infected and uninfected
ganglia by quantitative RNase protection assay and immunostaining. Alpha and beta
interferons and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) were also induced by
explantation. In addition, we have identified sequences that correspond to IRF-1 
consensus binding sites in both HSV type 1 origins of replication. Our findings
suggest that physiological pathways that include these cellular factors may be
involved in modulating HSV reactivation.

No association or linkage to IDDM of an interferon regulatory factor-1 gene
polymorphism in a Danish population. The Danish Study Group for Diabetes in

Nitric oxide is a potent mediator of the cytokine-induced cytotoxic effect on
pancreatic beta cells. It has been shown that the inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) is induced in islets of Langerhans by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta).
Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional factor known to play an
essential role in the induction of the inducible nitric oxide synthase, has also 
been shown to be induced by IL-1 beta in isolated islets of Langerhans. In the
present study we analysed a GT nucleotide repeat polymorphism in the intron 7 of 
the IRF-1 gene. We typed 123 Danish Caucasian insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM) multiplex families (550 individuals including 271 diabetic patients) and
108 control subjects of Danish Caucasian origin. In total, seven alleles were
identified. No significant differences in either allele or genotype distribution 
were found comparing IDDM patients with control subjects (P = 0.7 and P = 0.5,
respectively). An extended transmission disequilibrium test (ETDT) did not reveal
transmission disequilibrium in an allele-wise manner. A 16-nucleotide deletion
was found when sequencing the region containing the polymorphic GT repeat. This
new deletion was in linkage disequilibrium with the GT-repeat polymorphism, as it
was only seen with alleles of more than 13 GT tandem repeats. No association with
IDDM for the deletion was observed. Furthermore, three single base substitutions 
linked to the 16 nucleotide deletion were identified. Even though we could not
associate the GT-repeat polymorphism to IDDM in this study, additional mutation
screening is warranted, as we still think the IRF-1 gene is a potential candidate
gene for IDDM.

The p69/71 2-5A synthetase promoter contains multiple regulatory elements
required for interferon-alpha-induced expression.

Author information:

The p69/71 2-5A synthetase is an interferon-inducible enzyme that polymerizes ATP
to form 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates when activated by double-stranded RNA. A
genomic clone was isolated that contained 12.5 kb of the 5'-flanking region and
the first exon of the p69/71 2-5A synthetase gene. The major transcriptional
start site was mapped to an A residue located 84 bp upstream of the translational
start site within a sequence that matches both a consensus ISRE and an Inr
element. Sequencing of the region 972 bp upstream of the translation start site
revealed 4 imperfect direct repeats of 70 to 80 bp that contain several putative 
regulatory elements. This region does not have a TATA or CAAT box but does
contain two IRF-1-like elements, an Ets-1 motif, an AP-1 site, an Sp1 binding
site, an NF-kappaB-binding site, and a palindrome containing two overlapping
NF-IL-6 consensus motifs in opposite orientation. The region -480 to -850 bp
contains PuF, UBP-1, and PEA 3 motifs and another NF-IL-6 motif adjacent to an
E2A-binding site. The 5'-flanking sequence binds proteins in DNase I foot
printing assays and is a functional interferon-inducible promoter that requires
multiple elements for maximal constitutive and interferon-inducible expression.

In vivo class II transactivator expression in mice is induced by a
non-interferon-gamma mechanism in response to local injury.

BACKGROUND: Tissue injury induces MHC class II expression, which could be
important in the recognition of that tissue as an allograft. The class II
transcriptional activator (CIITA) is the major regulator of basal and induced MHC
class II expression and is essential for antigen presentation. The role of CIITA 
in the induction of class II by tissue injury is unknown. In this study, we
examined CIITA induction in the course of acute ischemic or toxic renal injury in
mice, including the role of interferon (IFN)-gamma and of the transcription
factor, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1.
METHODS: Kidneys were injured by ischemia or by gentamicin toxicity and were then
studied for changes in gene expression using Northern blot, reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, radioimmunoassay, and tissue staining.
We compared wild-type (WT) mice to IFN-gamma knockout (GKO) or IRF-1 knockout
mice.
RESULTS: Ischemic injury induced CIITA and class II expression in the kidney, in 
WT and GKO mice. Gentamicin injury also induced both CIITA and class II
expression, independent of IFN-gamma, in WT and GKO mice. After ischemic injury, 
the induction of class II protein levels and CIITA and class II mRNA levels were 
induced, to a lesser degree, in IRF-1 knockout mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that CIITA is induced by tissue injury, and
probably accounts for class II induction during tissue injury. CIITA induction by
injury is largely IFN-gamma independent but requires IRF-1. The similarities of
the pattern of CIITA and class II induction in ischemic and toxic injury suggest 
that this is a stereotyped response of injured tissue and not a consequence of a 
particular mechanism of injury.

Respiratory syncytial virus infection of neonatal monocytes stimulates synthesis 
of interferon regulatory factor 1 and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-converting
enzyme and secretion of IL-1beta.

Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production in response to respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) was investigated in normal neonate monocytes. Intracellular or
culture supernatant IL-1beta protein levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay. 
The expression of mRNAs for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1),
IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), and IL-1beta in the cells was analyzed
semiquantitatively by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Before RSV exposure, some IRF-1,
ICE, and IL-1beta transcripts were already expressed in the monocytes. The levels
of these transcripts increased significantly 2 h after RSV exposure compared with
those in mock-infected cells. At that time, significantly higher intracellular
IL-1beta protein levels were observed in RSV-exposed cells. After 20 h of RSV
exposure, quantities of soluble IL-1beta secreted from RSV-exposed cells were
moderately higher than those from noninfected cells. These observations suggest
that RSV infection of neonatal monocytes triggers enhanced transcription and
increased translation of the IL-1beta gene and increased secretion of the soluble
protein. The later phase of these processes may be promoted by ICE activity,
which was upregulated by increased IRF-1. The increase in IRF-1 activity may also
result from RSV infection.

Human herpesvirus 8 encodes an interferon regulatory factor (IRF) homolog that
represses IRF-1-mediated transcription.

Author information: 
(1)Winship Cancer Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.

Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the probable viral etiologic agent for Kaposi's
sarcoma. The HHV-8 genome encodes viral interferon regulatory factor (vIRF), a
gene product that has homology to the IRF family of transcription factors. We
demonstrate that vIRF inhibits responses to type I and type II interferons and
blocks IRF-1-mediated transcription. vIRF does not compete with IRF-1 for binding
to DNA or complex directly with IRF-1. The ability of vIRF to block
IRF-1-mediated transcription is independent of the DNA binding domains of both
vIRF and IRF-1. These data suggest that vIRF may contribute to viral pathogenesis
and cellular transformation by interfering with interferon- and IRF-1-mediated
gene expression through a novel mechanism.

Inhibition of interferon regulatory factor-1 expression results in predominance
of cell growth stimulatory effects of interferon-gamma due to phosphorylation of 
Stat1 and Stat3.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a potent inhibitor of hematopoiesis in vitro and 
has been implicated in the pathophysiology of human bone marrow failure
syndromes. IFN-gamma both inhibits cell cycling and induces expression of the
Fas-receptor, resulting in subsequent apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor
cells. IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) mediates some of these suppressive effects
by activation of downstream inducible genes, such as double-stranded
RNA-activatable protein kinase and inducible nitric oxide synthase. However,
under certain experimental conditions, IFN-gamma appears to stimulate
proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Based on the hypothesis that
IFN-gamma-receptor triggering may activate diverse signaling cascades, we
designed experiments to determine which intracellular mechanisms (in addition to 
the IRF-1 transduction pathway) influence the biologic effects of IFN-gamma.
Using antisense technique, we inhibited the IRF-1-mediated pathway in KG1a cells 
stimulated with IFN-gamma. In contrast to the suppressive effects of IFN-gamma
observed in control cells, untreated and IFN-gamma-treated KG-1a cells that were 
transduced with retroviral vectors expressing IRF-1 antisense mRNA showed
enhanced proliferation. The increased growth rate was associated with decreased
levels of IRF-1 mRNA and protein but unchanged levels of IRF-2. We inferred that 
IFN-gamma could also activate a stimulatory transduction pathway that, under
specific conditions, may control the cellular response to this cytokine. The
family of Stat proteins is involved in signal transduction of hematopoietic
growth factors. We showed that, in KG-1a cells, IFN-gamma also induced
phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3, whereas p42 MAP kinase was phosphorylated
regardless of the presence of IFN-gamma. Using electrophoresis mobility shift
assays, IFN-gamma enhanced Stat1-Stat1 homodimer and Stat1-Stat3 heterodimer
formation, suggesting that, in addition to inhibitory signals mediated by IRF-1, 
IFN-gamma may activate proliferative signals by phosphorylation of Stat1 and
Stat3 proteins. The observations made in experiments with KG-1a cells were
confirmed in primary hematopoietic cells. After inhibition of the IRF-1 pathway
by transduction of an antisense IRF-1 retrovirus into human CD34+ cells,
IFN-gamma produced an aberrant stimulatory effect on hematopoietic colony
formation. Conversely, in control vector-transduced CD34+ cells, the typical
inhibitory response to IFN-gamma was seen. Our results indicate that inhibitory
cytokines such as IFN-gamma may exhibit diverse biologic effects depending on the
intracellular balance of transcriptional regulators, in turn influenced by the
activation and differentiation status of the target cells.

Apoptosis during bone-like tissue development in vitro.

Worcester 01655, USA.

We present evidence of cell death by apoptosis during the development of
bone-like tissue formation in vitro. Fetal rat calvaria-derived osteoblasts
differentiate in vitro, progressing through three stages of maturation: a
proliferation period, a matrix maturation period when growth is downregulated and
expression of the bone cell phenotype is induced, and a third mineralization
stage marked by the expression of bone-specific genes. Here we show for the first
time that cells differentiating to the mature bone cell phenotype undergo
programmed cell death and express genes regulating apoptosis. Culture conditions 
that modify expression of the osteoblast phenotype simultaneously modify the
incidence of apoptosis. Cell death by apoptosis is directly demonstrated by
visualization of degraded DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments after gel
electrophoresis. Bcl-XL, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and Bax, which can accelerate
apoptosis, are expressed at maximal levels 24 h after initial isolation of the
cells and again after day 25 in heavily mineralized bone tissue nodules. Bcl-2 is
expressed in a reciprocal manner to its related gene product Bcl-XL with the
highest levels observed during the early post-proliferative stages of osteoblast 
maturation. Expression of p53, c-fos, and the interferon regulatory factors IRF-1
and IRF-2, but not cdc2 or cdk, were also induced in mineralized bone nodules.
The upregulation of Msx-2 in association with apoptosis is consistent with its in
vivo expression during embryogenesis in areas that will undergo programmed cell
death. We propose that cell death by apoptosis is a fundamental component of
osteoblast differentiation that contributes to maintaining tissue organization.

Specific inhibition of Stat3 signal transduction by PIAS3.

Author information:

The signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) protein is
activated by the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, epidermal growth
factor, and leptin. A protein named PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT)
that binds to Stat3 was isolated and characterized. The association of PIAS3 with
Stat3 in vivo was only observed in cells stimulated with ligands that cause the
activation of Stat3. PIAS3 blocked the DNA-binding activity of Stat3 and
inhibited Stat3-mediated gene activation. Although Stat1 is also phosphorylated
in response to IL-6, PIAS3 did not interact with Stat1 or affect its DNA-binding 
or transcriptional activity. The results indicate that PIAS3 is a specific
inhibitor of Stat3.

Identification of a novel transcriptional regulatory element common to the p53

The promoter regions of both the interferon regulatory factor (IRF1) and p53
antioncogenes contain a previously unidentified sequence denoted IRF1 p53 common 
sequence (IPCS), which markedly increases the transcriptional activity of a
reporter gene placed under the control of an heterologous promoter in transfected
U937 cells. In contrast, transfection of U937 cells with reporter vectors
containing p53 and IRF1 promoters with mutated IPCS sites resulted in a 4-fold
reduction in the constitutive expression of those two genes. The transcriptional 
activity of IPCS is strictly correlated with the binding of a novel nuclear
factor, IPCS-binding factor (IPCS-BF). IPCS-BF, which is composed of a single
polypeptide of 26 kDa, is present constitutively in nuclear extracts of both U937
cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. The finding
that the pattern of binding of IPCS-BF to the IPCS is unlike that of any known
transcription factor and that the IPCS sequence does not exhibit any significant 
homology with any known binding site present in the data base, strongly suggest
that IPCS-BF is a novel transcription factor which, by virtue of this ability to 
regulate the expression of the p53 and IRF1 genes, could play a central role in
the control of cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.

The multifunctional cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a central role in host
defence mechanisms and hematopoiesis. Furthermore, dysregulation of IL-6 gene
expression is associated with the pathogenesis of various immunologically related
diseases such as myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis and Kaposi's sarcoma. The regulation of IL-6 gene expression occurs
mainly at transcriptional level, although mechanisms of post-transcriptional
regulation have also been described. In the present study we demonstrate that in 
HeLa cells, induction of IL-6 by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is
transcriptionally controlled, as shown by run on assays and analysis of the IL-6 
mRNA stability. Gel-retardation experiments using antibodies specific for factors
of the IRF family identified four protein-DNA complexes, which bind to the
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding site at position -267 to -254, in
nuclear extracts from IFN-gamma treated cells. Furthermore, transient
transfection analyses of the 5'-flanking region of IL-6 gene linked to the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene demonstrated that the -267 
to -254 IRF site is necessary for IL-6 induction by IFN-gamma. However,
transfection experiments in which IRF-1 and I kappa B alpha were overexpressed
show that full-scale transcriptional activation of the IL-6 promoter directing
CAT expression requires the co-operation between IRF-1 and NF-kappa B at a low
constitutive level.

In the 1970s and 1980s, analysis of recombinant inbred, congenic and recombinant 
haplotype mouse strains permitted us to effectively 'scan' the murine genome for 
genes controlling resistance and susceptibility to leishmanial infections. Five
major regions of the genome were implicated in the control of infections caused
by different Leishmania species which, because they show conserved synteny with
regions of the human genome, immediately provides candidate gene regions for
human disease susceptibility genes. A common intramacrophage niche for
leishmanial and mycobacterial pathogens, and a similar spectrum of immune
response and disease phenotypes, also led to the prediction that the same
genes/candidate gene regions might be responsible for genetic susceptibility to
mycobacterial infections such as leprosy and tuberculosis. Indeed, one of the
murine genes (Nramp1) was identified for its role in controlling a range of
intramacrophage pathogens including leishmania, salmonella and mycobacterium
infections. In recent studies, multicase family data on visceral leishmaniasis
and the mycobacterial diseases, tuberculosis and leprosy, have been collected
from north-eastern Brazil and analysed to determine the role of these candidate
genes/regions in determining disease susceptibility. Complex segregation analysis
provides evidence for one or two major genes controlling susceptibility to
tuberculosis in this population. Family-based linkage analyses (combined
segregation and linkage analysis; sib-pair analysis), which have the power to
detect linkage between marker loci in candidate gene regions and the putative
disease susceptibility genes over 10-20 centimorgans, and transmission
disequilibrium testing, which detects allelic associations over 1 centimorgan
(ca. 1 megabase), have been used to examine the role of four regions in
determining disease susceptibility and/or immune response phenotype. Our results 
demonstrate: (i) the major histocompatibility complex (MHC: H-2 in mouse, HLA in 
man: mouse chromosome 17/human 6p; candidates class II and class III including
TNF alpha/beta genes) shows both linkage to, and allelic association with,
leprosy per se, but is only weakly associated with visceral leishmaniasis and
shows neither linkage to nor allelic association with tuberculosis; (ii) no
evidence for linkage between NRAMP1, the positionally cloned candidate for the
murine macrophage resistance gene Ity/Lsh/Bcg (mouse chromosome 1/human 2q35),
and susceptibility to tuberculosis or visceral leishmaniasis could be
demonstrated in this Brazilian population; (iii) the region of human chromosome
17q (candidates NOS2A, SCYA2-5) homologous with distal mouse chromosome 11,
originally identified as carrying the Scl1 gene controlling healing versus
nonhealing responses to Leishmania major, is linked to tuberculosis
susceptibility; and (iv) the 'T helper 2' cytokine gene cluster (proximal murine 
chromosome 11/human 5q; candidates IL4, IL5, IL9, IRF1, CD14) controlling later
phases of murine L. major infection, is not linked to human disease
susceptibility for any of the three infections, but shows linkage to and highly
significant allelic association with ability to mount an immune response to
mycobacterial antigens. These studies demonstrate that the 'mouse-to-man'
strategy, refined by our knowledge of the human immune response to infection, can
lead to the identification of important candidate gene regions in man.

CD4+ T cells from IRF-1-deficient mice exhibit altered patterns of cytokine
expression and cell subset homeostasis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037,

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a member of a family of transcription
factors that regulate an array of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation,
and death. Analysis of cytokine expression by stimulated CD4+ cells from
IRF-1(-/-) and IRF-1(+/+) mice revealed that IRF-1 deficiency resulted in an
elevated production of Th2-related cytokines and a compensatory decrease in the
expression of naive cell- and Th1-related cytokines. The altered cytokine
profiles of IRF-1(-/-) cells could be explained, in part, by a shift in the
representation of subsets of CD4+ cells; IRF-1(-/-) mice exhibited a decreased
percentage of naive cells (a major source of IL-2) but increased numbers of
memory or effector cells (the source of Th2-related cytokines). We analyzed
purified, phenotypically matched memory/effector cells from IRF-1(-/-) and
IRF-1(+/+) mice and found that the increased Th2:Th1 cytokine ratio was still
evident in the IRF-1(-/-) group, thus suggesting that IRF-1 is involved in the
polarization of the cytokine repertoire in CD4+ cells. Our data indicate that
IRF-1 plays an important role in the maintenance of CD4+ cell subset homeostasis 
and in the expression of cytokines by naive and memory/effector cells.

Transcriptional inhibition by Stat5. Differential activities at growth-related
versus differentiation-specific promoters.

Luo G(1), Yu-Lee L.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine,
Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

Prolactin (PRL) induces transcriptional activation of not only growth-related
genes such as interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) but also
differentiation-specific genes such as beta-casein through a signaling cascade
consisting of Janus kinases and Stat (signal transducer and activator of
transcription) factors. To understand better the role of Stats in PRL signaling, 
we cloned rat Stat5b from a PRL-responsive T cell line Nb2. A Stat5b-specific
peptide antibody was generated. In PRL receptor reconstituted COS cells
cotransfected with Stat5b or Stat5a, both Stat5 proteins become tyrosine
phosphorylated and bind to the IRF-1 GAS (interferon-gamma activation sequence)
element in a PRL-inducible manner. Unexpectedly, both Stat5b and Stat5a inhibit
PRL induction of the IRF-1 promoter, but they mediate PRL stimulation of the
beta-casein promoter. Stat5-mediated inhibition was observed only at the native
IRF-1 promoter and not at the isolated IRF-1 GAS element linked to a heterologous
thymidine kinase promoter. Mutational analyses showed that the DNA binding
activity of Stat5b is not required, but the carboxyl-terminal transactivation
domain is essential for Stat5b to inhibit PRL induction of the IRF-1 promoter.
These results suggest that Stat5b mediates inhibition via protein-protein
interactions. In contrast, both DNA binding and transactivation domains of Stat5b
are required to mediate PRL induction of the beta-casein promoter. Furthermore, a
carboxyl-terminal truncated dominant negative Stat5b can reverse Stat5b
inhibition at the IRF-1 promoter. These studies suggest that Stat proteins can
act as not only positive but also negative regulators of gene transcription.
Further, Stat5 can modulate gene expression without binding to DNA but via
protein-protein interactions.

Class I MHC protein is induced in glia but not mature neurons by IFN-gamma. We
have compared IFN-gamma signal transduction in these populations. There were
identical levels of STAT1 homodimers and IRF-1 by gel-shift and IRF-1 mRNA was
induced equally. However class I MHC, beta2-microglobulin and interleukin 1-beta 
converting enzyme mRNA levels were greatly reduced in neurons. These experiments 
show that there is no defect in expression of IRF-1 in response to IFN-gamma in
mature mouse neurons but that insufficient class I MHC gene expression is induced
for detectable cell surface protein expression.

Convergence of TNFalpha and IFNgamma signalling pathways through synergistic
induction of IRF-1/ISGF-2 is mediated by a composite GAS/kappaB promoter element.

Pine R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY 10016, USA.

The molecular basis for the well known synergistic biological effects of tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) is still poorly 
understood. This report demonstrates that expression of interferon-regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1), also known as interferon-stimulated-gene factor 2 (ISGF-2), is 
synergistically induced by these cytokines. The induction is a primary
transcriptional response that occurs rapidly without a requirement for new
protein synthesis. Synergism is mediated by a novel composite element in the
IRF-1 promoter that includes an IFNgamma-activation site (GAS) overlapped by a
non-consensus site for nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). These sequences are
bound strongly by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) and
weakly by the p50/p65 heterodimer form of NFkappaB, respectively. However, the
binding of STAT-1 and NFkappaB to the GAS/kappaB element in vitro seems to be
mutually exclusive and independent. Synergistic induction of IRF-1 is likely to
be an important early step in regulatory networks critical to the synergism of
TNFalpha and IFNgamma. The GAS/kappaB element may mediate synergistic
transcriptional induction of IRF-1 by other pairs of ligands that together
activate NFkappaB and STAT family members. Other genes are likely to contain this
motif and be regulated similarly.

Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1 has been characterized as an important
growth regulatory and immunomodulatory transcription factor. To further
characterize the potential targets of IRF-1 antiproliferative activity, IRF-1 was
expressed under the control of the tetracycline-inducible system in murine NIH3T3
cells. Due to their ability to mimic IRF-1 transactivator function, the
regulatory potential of IRF-1/RelA and IRF-2/RelA fusion proteins consisting of
the DNA binding domains of IRF-1 or IRF-2 fused to the transactivation domain of 
NF-kappaB RelA(p65) was also examined. Cells inducibly expressing IRF-1 or
IRF/RelA in response to doxycycline treatment displayed significantly reduced
growth rates compared to control cells, and inhibition of cell growth correlated 
directly with the level of transgene expression. Interestingly, IRF-1 and
IRF/RelA expression also induced a low level of apoptosis, as detected by
microscopic analyses. Furthermore, expression of the interferon inducible, double
stranded RNA dependent kinase PKR was increased following IRF-1 or IRF/RelA
induction. Most strikingly, induction of IRF-1 and IRF/RelA expression resulted
in a significant increase in STAT1 (p91) protein and increased ISGF3 DNA binding 
activity, suggesting that IRF-1 tumor suppressor activity may involve a novel
mechanism which activates the JAK-STAT pathway through STAT1. WAF1 levels were
also constitutively elevated in IRF-1 and IRF-1/RelA cells. These studies
demonstrate that inducible expression of the transactivation function of IRF-1 or
IRF/RelA mediates tumor suppressor activity by inducing cell growth arrest,
apoptosis and the differential activation of growth regulatory genes such as PKR,
STAT1 and WAF1.

at G1, and subsequent macrophage differentiation. To understand the mechanisms by
which Stat3 causes such effects, we searched for other Stat3-regulated genes
possibly involved in growth arrest. We identified this inducible molecule as
p19INK4D using a specific antibody. Both p19INK4D mRNA and protein were rapidly
induced by IL-6 treatment without requiring de novo protein synthesis and the
induction was fully suppressed by dominant-negative forms of Stat3. Thus both
Stat3-regulated events, repressions of c-myc and c-myb and induction of p19INK4D,
are likely to be involved in IL-6-induced growth arrest in M1 cells.

The IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) DNA binding protein regulates expression of
genes that are involved with the induction of immune and inflammatory responses. 
The present study used mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN regulatory
factor-1 gene (IRF-1-/-) to examine the role of this transcription factor in
synovial inflammation and nitric oxide production. Intraarticular injection of
IL-1 or LPS was associated with a significantly reduced intensity of synovial
lining hyperplasia and leukocyte infiltration in the IRF-1-/- mice as compared
with wild-type mice of the same parental lineage C57BL/6. Nitric oxide (NO) is
involved with the pathogenesis of arthritis, and IRF-1 regulates expression of
inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in mononuclear phagocytes. Articular chondrocytes
from IRF-1-/- mice produced similar levels of NO in response to IL-1 or LPS.
Furthermore, the synergistic induction of NO by IFN-gamma and IL-1 or LPS was
almost identical in chondrocytes from wild-type and IRF-1-/- mice. This was in
contrast to the expected decrease in NO production by peritoneal macrophages from
IRF-1-/- mice, suggesting that IRF-1 is not required for iNOS expression in
chondrocytes. These results indicate that IRF-1 has a tissue-specific role in the
induction of iNOS. Inhibition of this transcription factor may represent a novel 
approach in controlling inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) acts as a transcriptional activator in the
interferon system and as a tumor suppressor. The loss of functional IRF-1 has
been observed in a significant number of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) and leukemia, suggesting a potentially critical role of IRF-1 in human
oncostasis. Here we report an alternative mechanism by which IRF-1 may be
inactivated. We purified an IRF-1 association molecule which was revealed to be
identical to a nuclear factor nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23/numatrin. Functional
analysis showed that NPM inhibited the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity
of IRF-1. Moreover, NPM was overexpressed in several clinical leukemia samples
and human-derived leukemia cell lines. Finally, overexpression of NPM in NIH3T3
cells resulted in malignant transformation. These results suggest the possible
involvement of NPM in inactivating IRF-1-dependent anti-oncogenic surveillance in
human cancer development.

Interferon (IFN) has anti-cell-proliferative activities. Some of the
interferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) products have important roles for controlling
cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Candidates for that kind of ISGs
involve PKR, IRF-1, IRF-2, 2'5' OAS, RNaseL, and ICSBP. The PKR phosphorylate
eIF2 alpha that leads to blocking of protein synthesis, mediates signal
transduction via NF-kappa B and/or probably IRF-1, and is also involved in
apoptosis. IRF-1 leads to apoptosis to prevent malignant transformation when a
cell undergoes initial oncogene activation, and controls cell proliferation by
balancing with IRF-2. 2'5' OAS and RNaseL system also has possibilities to have
those roles. ICSBP, one of the IRF family, has new findings from the knock-out
mouse. The mouse developed a hematopoietic abnormality which looks very similar
to human chronic myelogenous leukemia, indicating ICSBP has important roles in
proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells.

School, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.

Nitric oxide production in a variety of inflammatory conditions is dependent on
the synthesis of the enzyme, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). The gene for
this enzyme is regulated by a number of inflammatory cytokines, including
interferon-gamma. Transcriptional activation of the gene is dependent on the
interferon-gamma-induced transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1). Using a 99-base pair segment of the iNOS gene promoter encompassing
nucleotides -979 to -881, a region essential for gene activation by cytokines, we
show that with increasing concentrations of added IRF-1, a monomeric then a
dimeric complex form. Molecular footprinting analysis shows that the factor binds
initially to a canonical IRF-1 site as a monomer. The region of binding is then
extended both in a 5' and 3' direction on formation of the dimeric complex, with 
additional contacts in the minor groove of DNA. Binding of the second molecule of
IRF-1 is dependent on the presence of the initial bound protein. Sequential
binding of IRF-1 to form a dimeric complex has not been described previously, and
we show that formation of this dimeric complex is essential for full activation
of the iNOS gene by cytokines in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional regulation
that govern T cell selection processes and the differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells. Mice lacking the interferon regulatory transcription factor-1 (IRF-1) have
reduced numbers of mature CD8+ cells within the thymus and peripheral lymphatic
organs. Here we show that positive and negative T cell selection of two MHC class
I-restricted TCR alphabeta transgenes, H-Y and P14, are impaired in IRF-1-/-
mice. The absence of IRF-1 resulted in decreased expression of LMP2, TAP1, and
MHC class I on thymic stromal cells. Despite decreased MHC class I expression on 
IRF-1-/- thymic stromal cells, the defect in CD8+ T cells development did not
reside in the thymic environment, and IRF-1-/- stromal cells can fully support
development of CD8+ thymocytes in in vivo bone marrow chimeras and in vitro
reaggregation cultures. Moreover, IRF-1-/- thymocytes displayed impaired
TCR-mediated signal transduction, and the induction of negative selection in TCR 
Tg thymocytes from IRF-1-/- mice required a 1000-fold increase in selecting
peptide. We also provide evidence that IRF-1 is mainly expressed in mature, but
not immature, thymocytes and that expression of IRF-1 in immature thymocytes is
induced after peptide-specific TCR activation. These results indicate that IRF-1 
regulates gene expression in developing thymocytes required for lineage
commitment and selection of CD8+ thymocytes.

apoptotic responses in hematopoietic cells.

Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) from mice nullizygous at the Fanconi anemia 
(FA) group C locus (FAC -/-) are hypersensitive to the mitotic inhibitory effects
of interferon (IFN-gamma). We tested the hypothesis that HPC from the bone marrow
of Fanconi group C children are similarly hypersensitive and that the fas pathway
is involved in affecting programmed cell death in response to low doses of
IFN-gamma. In normal human and murine HPC, IFN-gamma primed the fas pathway and
induced both fas and interferon response factor-1 (IRF-1) gene expression. These 
IFN-gamma-induced apoptotic responses in HPC from the marrow of a child with FA
of the C group (FA-C) and in FAC -/- mice occurred at significantly lower IFN
doses (by an order of magnitude) than did the apoptotic responses of normal HPC. 
Treatment of FA-C CD34+ cells with low doses of recombinant IFN-gamma, inhibited 
growth of colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage and burst-forming unit
erythroid, while treatment with blocking antibodies to fas augmented clonal
growth and abrogated the clonal inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma. Transfer of the
normal FAC gene into FA-C B-cell lines prevented mitomycin C-induced apoptosis,
but did not suppress fas expression or inhibit the primed fas pathway. However,
the kinetics of Stat1-phosphate decay in IFN-gamma-treated cells was prolonged in
mutant cells and was normalized by transduction of the normal FAC gene.
Therefore, the normal FAC protein serves, in part, to modulate IFN-gamma signals.
HPC bearing inactivating mutations of FAC fail to normally modulate IFN-gamma
signals and, as a result, undergo apoptosis executed through the fas pathway.

Unmasking by soluble IL-6 receptor of IL-6 effect on metastatic melanoma: growth 
inhibition and differentiation of B16-F10.9 tumor cells.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibits the growth of melanocytes and of early stage
melanoma cells, but not that of advanced melanoma cells. The in vitro IL-6
response can be restored in the highly metastatic melanoma B16-F10.9 by addition 
of recombinant soluble IL-6 receptor alpha-chain (sIL-6R). The F10.9 cells then
undergo irreversible growth-arrest and show increased adherence with changes from
epithelioid to spindleoid morphology. The sIL-6R is required for IL-6 to induce a
sustained activation of the various Stat transcription factors which bind to
specific IL-6 inducible enhancers. The sIL-6R and IL-6 combination causes an
increase in the level of the anti-oncogenic transcription factor IRF-1 protein
and DNA-binding, which remain elevated for 24 h. The promoter activity of the
anti-oncogenic p21/Waf-1/Cip-1 gene is induced and accumulation of the p21
protein is observed. These results illustrate the potent agonist activity of
sIL-6R on molecular pathways which could mediate the growth-arrest and
differentiation of the metastatic melanoma cells. Previously observed
antimetastatic effects of IL-6 therapy in mice bearing F10.9 tumors may be at
least partly due to direct growth inhibition and differentiation elicited by
sIL-6R present in biological fluids.

iNOS expression and nitrotyrosine formation in the myocardium in response to
inflammation is controlled by the interferon regulatory transcription factor 1.

Biophysics, University of Toronto, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Production of NO by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) has been implicated 
in the pathology of spontaneous and antigen-induced autoimmune diseases, and iNOS
is expressed in the myocardium of patients with heart failure. It is not clear
whether inflammatory murine autoimmune heart disease, an experimental model for
human postviral heart disease, is characterized by increased iNOS expression
within the heart and whether iNOS and NO are essential in the pathogenesis of
autoimmune myocarditis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In the murine model of cardiac myosin-induced myocarditis,
we demonstrate that iNOS expression was elicited in inflammatory macrophages and 
in distinct cardiomyocytes. Autoimmune heart disease was accompanied by formation
of the NO reaction product nitrotyrosine in inflammatory macrophages as well as
in cardiomyocytes. iNOS expression and nitrotyrosine formation were strictly
dependent on myocardial inflammation. Focal myocarditis was sufficient to induce 
nitrotyrosine formation throughout the whole heart muscle. Mice defective for the
interferon regulatory transcription factor-1 (IRF-1(-/-)) after gene targeting
failed to induce iNOS expression and nitrotyrosine formation in the heart but
developed cardiac myosin-induced myocarditis at prevalence and severity similar
to those of heterozygous littermates (IRF-1(+/-)).
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first in vivo evidence that iNOS expression
and NO synthesis in macrophages and distinct cardiomyocytes are elicited in
experimental murine inflammatory heart disease. The transcription factor IRF-1
controls iNOS expression and NO synthesis in disease. Because autoimmune
myocarditis can develop in animals lacking IRF-1, these mice will be useful to
elucidate the link between iNOS expression in inflammatory heart disease and the 
development of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.

Interferons up-regulate STAT1, STAT2, and IRF family transcription factor gene
expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages.

Lehtonen A(1), Matikainen S, Julkunen I.

IFN signaling is mediated by binding of IFNs to their receptors and subsequent
activation of Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway. Stimulation of 
cells with IFN-alpha leads to the assembly of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3
transcription factor complex formed by STAT1, STAT2, and p48 protein. IFN-gamma
signaling is mediated by homodimeric STAT1 protein. Although these signaling
molecules are expressed constitutively, there is also evidence of transcriptional
regulation by IFNs. We have characterized the expression of STAT and IFN
regulatory factor (IRF) family transcription factors in primary human blood
mononuclear cells and macrophages in response to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma
stimulation. We show that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma rapidly and efficiently
enhanced STAT1, STAT2, p48, and IRF-1 gene expression. IFN-gamma induced IRF-1
gene expression more strongly than IFN-alpha. Stimulation experiments in the
presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggested that these
genes were activated directly by IFNs. IRF-2 gene was apparently only weakly
responsive to IFNs in these cells. When macrophages were pretreated with low
doses of IFN-gamma and then stimulated with IFN-alpha, clearly enhanced formation
of specific transcription factor complexes was detected. This suggests that
higher intracellular levels of STAT1, STAT2, and p48 protein may result in
enhanced signal transduction for cytokines utilizing these transcription factors.

Interferon-regulatory factors during development of CD4 and CD8 thymocytes.

(1)Centre d'Immunologie, INSERM-CNRS de Marseille Luminy, France.

Selection events in the thymus occur at the double-positive CD4+ CD8+ (DP)
developmental stage leading either to further differentiation of the CD4+ and
CD8+ lineages or to deletion. The interferon-regulatory factor IRF-1 has been
implicated in signalling for T-cell death and also in CD8+ thymic
differentiation. IRF-1 is an activator and IRF-2 a repressor of gene
transcription regulated by type 1 interferons (IFN). To evaluate the role of
IRF-1 and IRF-2 in the differentiation of CD4 and CD8 thymocytes, we analysed
their DNA-binding activity before and after antigenic stimulation at different
stages of thymic development and in peripheral T cells. Unseparated,
double-positive and single-positive thymocytes as well as peripheral T
lymphocytes from mice transgenic (tg) for a T-cell receptor (TCR), restricted
either by major histocompatibility complex class I or class II, were stimulated
by their nominal antigen. Our results demonstrate that the DNA-binding activity
of IRF-2 and, weakly, that of IRF-1 are inducible in total thymocytes in response
to antigen. There is no induction of IRF-1/IRF-2 binding activity at the
double-positive stage of thymic development in the MHC class II-restricted model 
whereas in the MHC class I-restricted model IRF-1/IRF-2 activity is induced
weakly. At the single-positive stage, antigen induces the IRF-1/IRF-2 DNA binding
in both CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes, but not in mature lymphocytes from the
periphery. This pattern of expression suggests that IRF-1/IRF-2 binding
activities resulting from antigen stimulation are developmentally regulated. No
evidence for a selective role of IRF-1 in the development of the CD8+ lineage was
found, however.

Expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) genes and response to
interferon-alpha in chronic myeloid leukaemia.

Medical School, London, UK.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 1 and 2 are DNA-binding proteins which
control interferon (IFN) gene expression. IRF1 functions as an activator for IFN 
and IFN-inducible genes, whereas IRF2 represses the action of IRF1. Expression of
the two regulatory genes is itself IFN-inducible. Because therapeutic responses
of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients to IFN-alpha may be determined by
intracellular levels of these two mutually antagonistic transcription factors, we
have devised a competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assay which provides an estimate of the ratio of IRF1 to IRF2 expression
in a given cell population. Analysis of peripheral blood leucocytes from 25
normal individuals showed that the IRF1:IRF2 ratio varied between 1.13 and 2.30
(mean +/- s.d. 1.49 +/- 0.33). Similar values were obtained for normal bone
marrow specimens, with no significant difference between CD34+ and CD34- cells.
In contrast, the IRF1:IRF2 ratio in leucocytes from CML patients showed a much
wider variation (0.53-5.11). Eleven out of 130 patients in chronic phase had
ratios above the normal range, whereas none of the 33 blast crisis samples had a 
ratio >2.5. Analysis of diagnostic specimens in 59 CML patients treated
subsequently with IFN-alpha showed a high IRF1:IRF2 ratio of 5.11 in one of two
patients who became complete responders; all the 53 patients with minimal or no
cytogenetic response had ratios below 2.5. In a separate series of 97 CML
patients studied after IFN-alpha therapy a highly significant correlation was
found between the IRF1:IRF2 ratio and both the cytogenetic and the molecular
response (ie low concentration of BCR-ABL transcripts) to treatment: 53 out of
115 prospectively analysed samples of good cytogenetic responders had ratios
above 2.0, as opposed to only 13 out of 91 samples from poor responders (P <
0.0001; chi2 test). We conclude that a high ratio of IRF1/IRF2 expression may be 
associated with good cytogenetic and molecular response to IFN-alpha in CML.

The radical nitric oxide (NO) may be a mediator of beta-cell damage in IDDM. The 
cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-1beta are required for expression of the enzyme nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), and NO production by human pancreatic islets. In this
study, possible mechanisms by which IFN-gamma participates in iNOS messenger RNA 
(mRNA) expression were evaluated in both rodent and human islets cells. Addition 
of IFN-gamma, before or after arrest of IL-1beta-induced iNOS gene transcription 
by actinomycin D, did not prolong iNOS mRNA half life in the rat
insulin-producing cell line RINm5F (RIN cells). IFN-gamma also failed to modify
IL-1beta-induced activation of the transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in RIN
cells, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, IFN-gamma 
induced an early (30 min(-1) h) increase in interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) mRNA expression and a later (2 h) 19-fold increase in RIN cell nuclear
IRF-1 protein content, an effect further potentiated by IL-1beta. The total
cellular content of IRF-1 protein increased by 30- to 50-fold in human islets
exposed for 2-8h to IFN-gamma or IFN-gamma + IL-1beta. IL-1beta alone induced a
marginal and transient increase in IRF-1. It has been previously reported that
nicotinamide prevents IL-1beta-induced IRF-1 expression in rat pancreatic islets.
However, nicotinamide (20 mM) presently failed to prevent IL-1beta +
IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1 protein expression in human pancreatic islets. In
conclusion, the effects of IFN-gamma on iNOS expression can neither be explained 
by iNOS mRNA stabilization nor increased NF-kappaB activation. However, IFN-gamma
induces an early increase in cellular IRF-1 content, and this may contribute to
increased iNOS mRNA expression.

Interferon (IFN)-gamma increases the sensitivity of tumor cell lines, many of
which are p53 mutants, to tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated and anti-Fas
antibody-mediated cell death. To better understand the mechanism of IFN-gamma
action in modulating the cell death response independently of p53 function, we
analyzed the death of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, following 
treatment with IFN-gamma and various cytotoxic agents. Here we show that
IFN-gamma modulates cell death by sensitizing the cells to killing by numerous
pro-apoptotic stimuli but not pro-necrotic stimuli. Furthermore, we show that
select genes from several important apoptosis-related gene families are induced
by IFN-gamma, including the apoptosis-signaling receptors CD95 (Fas/APO-1) and
TNFR 1 and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (Ice) family members Ice, CPP32
(Yama, apopain), ICErel-II (TX, Ich-2), Mch-3 (ICE-LAP3, CMH-1), Mch-4, and Mch-5
(MACH, FLICE). Of the bcl-2 family members, IFN-gamma directly induced bak but
notably not bax, which is activated by p53. The IFN-responsive transcriptional
activator interferon regulatory factor-1 was also strongly induced and
translocated into the nucleus following IFN-gamma treatment. We propose that
IFN-gamma modulates a p53-independent apoptotic pathway by both directly and
indirectly inducing select apoptosis-related genes.

Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) exerts
inhibitory and cytotoxic effects on various cells including neuronal cells. Glial
NO production, mediated via induction of iNOS, is thought to facilitate neuronal 
damage during cerebral ischemia. Recently, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
has been reported to be an essential transcription factor for iNOS mRNA induction
in murine macrophages. However, expression of IRF-1 and its role in the central
nervous system have not been examined. In the present study, by using primary
glial cell cultures from mice with targeted disruption of the IRF-1 gene, we
investigated whether IRF-1 is involved in iNOS mRNA induction in glial cells.
After stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma, IRF-1 mRNA was
strongly induced in wild-type (IRF-1 +/+) glial cells. iNOS mRNA induction and
nitrite production in IRF-1 -/- glial cells were reduced as compared with those
observed in IRF-1 +/+ glial cells. Diethyldithiocarbamate, a selective inhibitor 
of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), completely inhibited iNOS
mRNA induction. These results suggest that not only NF-kappa B but also IRF-1
play important roles in iNOS mRNA induction in the central nervous system.

Nitric oxide (NO) exerts cytotoxic effects on various cells including neuronal
cells. Glial NO production, mediated via induction of inducible NO synthase
(iNOS), enhances neurotoxicity associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor. The present study examined whether nicotinamide, an inhibitor of poly
(ADP-ribose) synthetase, inhibits NO formation in primary culture of rat glial
cells. Nicotinamide (5-20 mM) suppressed iNOS mRNA expression and subsequent NO
formation, which were induced by the combination of interferon-gamma and
lipopolysaccharide, in a dose dependent manner. In addition, high-concentration
(20 mM) nicotinamide decreased mRNA of interferon regulatory factor-1, a
transcription factor which plays a major role in iNOS mRNA induction. These
results suggest that nicotinamide may have protective effect on glial NO-related 
pathologies by preventing iNOS mRNA induction.

Synergy between interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in
transcriptional activation is mediated by cooperation between signal transducer
and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor kappaB.

Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) cooperate 
to induce the expression of many gene products during inflammation. The present
report demonstrates that a portion of this cooperativity is mediated by synergism
between two distinct transcription factors: signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). IFNgamma and
TNFalpha synergistically induce expression of mRNAs encoding interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1, Mig (monokine
induced by gamma-interferon), and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell
expressed and secreted) in normal but not STAT1-deficient mouse fibroblasts,
indicating a requirement for STAT1. Transient transfection assays in fibroblasts 
using site-directed mutants of a 1.3-kilobase pair sequence of the IRF-1 gene
promoter revealed that the synergy was dependent upon two sequence elements; a
STAT binding element and a kappaB motif. Artificial constructs containing a
single copy of both a STAT binding element and a kappaB motif linked to the
herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter were able to mediate synergistic response 
to IFNgamma and TNFalpha; such response varied with both the relative spacing and
the specific sequence of the regions between these two sites. Cooperatively
responsive sequence constructs bound both STAT1alpha and NF-kappaB in nuclear
extracts prepared from IFNgamma- and/or TNFalpha-stimulated fibroblasts, although
binding of individual factors was not cooperative. Thus, the frequently observed 
synergy between IFNgamma and TNFalpha in promoting inflammatory response depends 
in part upon cooperation between STAT1alpha and NF-kappaB, which is most likely
mediated by their independent interaction with one or more components of the
basal transcription complex.

Role of the bZIP transcription factor IREBF1 in the NGF induction of
stromelysin-1 (transin) gene expression in PC12 cells.

Stromelysin-1 (ST-1) is one of the most nerve growth factor-(NGF) responsive gene
products expressed in PC12 cells. In previous work, we identified a novel
NGF-responsive element in the proximal promoter region of the ST-1 gene that
participates in this induction, and showed that it bound a protein present in the
nuclei of PC12 cells. Here, we identify a transcription factor that specifically 
recognizes this regulatory element-the interferon-response element binding
factor-1 (IREBF1), a member of the basic leucine zipper gene family. We show that
IREBF1 is constitutively expressed in PC12 cells and that overexpression of
IREBF1 augments NGF-responsive ST-1 gene regulation, but does not affect basal
levels of expression. On the other hand, expression of a mutated form of this
transcription factor lacking the DNA binding domain attenuated NGF
responsiveness, without affecting basal levels of expression. These data suggest 
that IREBF1 is part of the NGF-responsive transcriptional machinery necessary for
the expression of ST-1 in PC12 cells.

IRF-1 expression in normal human epidermal keratinocytes.

(1)Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of cell growth arrest in human
epidermal keratinocytes. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), an
interferon-inducible gene, is a mediator of interferon action. It has also been
suggested that IRF-1 may have a functional role as a tumor suppressor gene and
may be associated with the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma. We examined the
expression of IRF-1 mRNA in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Northern
blot analysis demonstrated an increased expression of IRF-1 mRNA by IFN-gamma in 
NHEKs. This increased expression of IRF-1 mRNA by IFN-gamma was not blocked by
treatment with cycloheximide, but was abolished by treatment with actinomycin D. 
In addition, neither pretreatment with TPA, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator,
nor treatment with H7, a PKC inhibitor, affected the induction of IRF-1 mRNA by
IFN-gamma. These results indicate that IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1 mRNA in NHEKs is
transcriptional and PKC-independent.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) mediates the
effects of IFN. No information exists on its role in lymphokine production.
Protection against the intracellular pathogen Leishmania major depends on a Th1
response. Here, we show that CD4+ T cells from Leishmania-infected mice lacking
one (+/-) or both (-/-) alleles of the IRF-1 gene developed a profound, gene
dose-dependent decrease in IFNgamma production. IRF-1(-/-) mice showed
dramatically exacerbated Leishmaniasis. They produced increased
Leishmania-specific IgG1 and IgE, and their CD4+ T cells produced increased IL-4,
characteristics of the non-protective Th2 response. In cell transfer experiments,
IRF-1(-/-) CD4+ T cells mounted normal Th1 responses. However, the ability of
IRF-1(-/-) mice to produce IL-12 was severely compromised. Thus, IRF-1 is a
determining factor for Th1 responses.

Eradication of a given pathogen is dependent on the selective differentiation of 
T helper (Th) cells into Th1 or Th2 types. We show here that T cells from mice
lacking the transcription factor IRF-1 fail to mount Th1 responses and instead
exclusively undergo Th2 differentiation in vitro. Compromised Th1 differentiation
is found to be associated with defects in multiple cell types, namely impaired
production of interleukin-12 by macrophages, hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ T cells
to interleukin-12, and defective development of natural killer cells. These
results indicate the involvement of IRF-1 in multiple stages of the Th1 limb of
the immune response.

Ultraviolet light suppresses IFN-gamma-induced IL-7 gene expression in murine
keratinocytes by interfering with IFN regulatory factors.

UV light is a potent stimulus for keratinocytes to release several cytokines.
Recently, UV light was shown to inhibit keratinocyte release of IL-7, a growth
factor for dendritic epidermal T cells. Since to date IL-7 is the only
keratinocyte-derived cytokine down-regulated by UV light, we addressed the
molecular mechanisms involved. IFN-gamma treatment of the murine keratinocyte
cell line Pam 212 resulted in an up-regulation of IL-7 mRNA, while IL-7
transcripts were suppressed in cells exposed to UV before IFN-gamma. Because
IFN-gamma induces IL-7 via activation of an IFN-stimulated response element
(ISRE) located in the 5' upstream region of the IL-7 gene, bandshift assays were 
performed using the ISRE sequence from the IL-7 gene. Nuclear extracts from
untreated cells revealed two bands, a slower migrating band identified by
supershift analysis as IFN regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), a transcriptional
repressor, and a more rapidly migrating band identified as IRF-1, a
transcriptional activator. IFN-gamma significantly induced IRF-1 binding, whereas
UV treatment plus IFN-gamma decreased IRF-1 binding, suggesting that UV light
suppresses IFN-gamma-induced expression of IL-7 by interfering with IRF-1.
Chloramphenicol transferase assay confirmed functional relevance, showing that
the minimal promoter sequence for the ISRE explicitly responded to IFN-gamma,
which was suppressed by UV irradiation. Northern blot analysis using an IRF-1
cDNA probe revealed that UV light reduced IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1 mRNA. This
study demonstrates that UV light can inhibit cytokine activities by interference 
with transcriptional activators. This newly described ability of UV light may
contribute to its immunosuppressive properties.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 up-regulates angiotensin II type 2 receptor and
induces apoptosis.

The expression of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor is developmentally and
growth regulated. In cultured R3T3 cells, expression of this receptor is markedly
induced at the confluent state and with serum deprivation. In this study we
demonstrated that the removal of serum from culture media resulted in the
induction of apoptosis in these cells and the addition of angiotensin II further 
enhanced apoptosis. We have previously identified an interferon regulatory factor
(IRF) binding motif in the mouse AT2 receptor gene promoter region. In this
report, we observed that serum removal increased IRF-1 expression, with a rapid
and transient decrease of IRF-2. To prove that the changes in IRFs after serum
removal mediated apoptosis and up-regulated AT2 receptor, we transfected
antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 or IRF-2 into R3T3 cells and observed that
IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide attenuated apoptosis and abolished the
up-regulation of AT2 receptor. IRF-2 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment did
not affect the onset of apoptosis after serum removal; instead, it increased AT2 
receptor binding and enhanced angiotensin II-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, 
these results suggest that increased IRF-1 after serum starvation contributes to 
the induction of apoptosis and that increased IRF-1 up-regulates the AT2 receptor
expression after serum starvation, resulting in enhanced angiotensin II-mediated 
apoptosis.

Interferon regulatory factors: growth control and histone gene regulation--it's
not just interferon anymore.

Vaughan PS(1), van Wijnen AJ, Stein JL, Stein GS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center,
Worcester 01655, USA.

Interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) are a related family of proteins originally 
identified by their ability to bind a DNA sequence found in the beta-interferon
gene and many interferon-stimulated genes. Two well-studied members of this
family, IRF-1 and IRF-2, have antagonistic roles in interferon-beta gene
regulation: IRF-1 activates this gene, and IRF-2 represses the activation by
IRF-1, IRF-1 and IRF-2 have more recently been linked to growth control by
displaying tumor suppressor and oncogenic activities, respectively. A possible
explanation for the oncogenic activity of IRF-2 is the discovery that IRF-2 can
activate a histone gene that is functionally coupled to cell cycle progression.
This first report of native IRF-2 playing the role of activator of a gene
essential for growth may lead to the discovery of a more general involvement of
interferon regulatory factors in mediating growth control.

Molecular actions of prolactin in the immune system.

Yu-Lee LY(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

The immunoregulatory properties of prolactin, a pituitary peptide hormone, have
received renewed attention. The prolactin receptor, a member of the
hematopoietin/cytokine receptor superfamily, is ubiquitously expressed by cells
in the immune system. Certain subpopulations of lymphocytes synthesize and
secrete biologically active prolactin, which suggests that prolactin can act as
an autocrine and/or paracrine factor to modulate the activities of cells of the
immune system. This review focuses on the molecular actions of prolactin in the
immune system. Emphasis is given to recent information about the molecular
mechanisms of prolactin receptor signal transduction, and the signaling molecules
and prolactin-inducible target genes that participate in these responses. In
particular, the prolactin-inducible interferon regulatory factor-1 gene and its
roles in mediating diverse immune responses are highlighted.

IFN regulatory factor-1 plays a central role in the regulation of the expression 
of class I and II MHC genes in vivo.

Hobart M(1), Ramassar V, Goes N, Urmson J, Halloran PF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

Transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is implicated in
regulating class I MHC expression in vitro. We investigated the in vivo
relationship between IRF-1 and MHC expression in kidney and other nonlymphoid
organs, assessing MHC expression in mice with disrupted IRF-1 genes (IRF-1 KO)
compared with mice with intact IRF-1 genes (WT). In kidneys of IRF-1 KO mice,
basal class I expression was decreased, particularly on arterial endothelium, but
basal class II expression was unchanged. The induction of both class I and class 
II expression by injected rIFN-gamma was reduced in IRF-1 KOs, compared with WT
mice. Similarly, stimuli that induce endogenous IFN-gamma production (LPS or
oxazolone) massively increased MHC expression in kidneys of WT mice, with little 
increase in IRF-1 KO mice. Impaired class II induction by rIFN-gamma in IRF-1 KO 
mice probably reflects the role of IRF-1 in regulating class II transactivator
(CIITA) expression: rIFN-gamma induced CIITA mRNA less in kidneys of IRF-1 KO
mice than in WT mice. In organs of WT mice, IRF-1 mRNA was expressed in the basal
state, and rIFN-gamma treatment increased IRF-1 mRNA before the induction of
class I or CIITA mRNA. Treatment of WT mice with cycloheximide plus rIFN-gamma
superinduced IRF-1 mRNA expression, but partially inhibited CIITA mRNA
expression, indicating that IRF-1 mRNA induction is not dependent on new protein 
synthesis, unlike CIITA. Thus, in vivo, IRF-1 plays a major role in basal and
induced class I expression and in induction of class II by IFN-gamma, probably
via CIITA induction.

Phosphorylation events modulate the ability of interferon consensus sequence
binding protein to interact with interferon regulatory factors and to bind DNA.

Two families of transcription factors mediate interferon (IFN) signaling. The
first family, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), is
activated within minutes of IFN treatment. Specific phosphorylation events lead
to their translocation to the nucleus, formation of transcriptional complexes,
and the induction of the second family of transcription factors termed interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs). Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) 
is a member of IRF family that is expressed only in cells of the immune system
and acts as a transcriptional repressor. ICSBP binds DNA through the association 
with other transcription factors such as IRF-1 or IRF-2. In this communication,
the domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions was mapped to the
carboxyl terminus of ICSBP. This domain is also important for mediating
ICSBP-repressing activity. In vitro studies demonstrated that direct binding of
ICSBP to DNA is prevented by tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation. Yet,
Tyr-phosphorylated ICSBP can bind target DNA only through the association with
IRF-2 and IRF-1. This type of phosphorylation is essential for the formation of
heterocomplexes. Tyr-phosphorylated ICSBP and IRF-2 are detected in expressing
cells constitutively, and Tyr-phosphorylated IRF-1 is induced by IFN-gamma. These
results strongly suggest that like the STATs, the IRFs are also modulated by Tyr 
phosphorylation that affects their biological activities.

A search of cell lines showing aberrant cell-cycle checkpoints revealed the lack 
of gamma-irradiation-induced G1 arrest in the BALB/c 3T3 A31 variant 1-1
(A31-1-1) clone. This clone is well-known for its hypersensitivity to
transformation by DNA damaging agents. p53 stabilization and p21 mRNA induction
after 8 Gy irradiation were observed, suggesting that the abrogation of G1 arrest
occurred in spite of normal p53 and p21 responses by abnormal regulation of other
cellular factors. Constitutive overexpression of Mdm2 and Cdk4 mRNAs was found,
which might have contributed to the loss of G1 arrest. In addition,
overexpression of a growth-suppressive transcription factor, Irf1, a putative key
molecule in the p53-independent pathway after DNA damage, was also observed,
although the relation to the loss of G1 arrest could not be elucidated.

Lymphocytes are highly sensitive to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In thymocytes, 
the tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to be required for this type of
apoptosis. However an as yet unknown, p53-independent pathway(s) appears to
mediate the same event in mitogenically activated mature T lymphocytes. By using 
mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene, we revealed that DNA damage-induced 
apoptosis in the latter cell type is dependent on the anti-oncogenic
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Thus two different
anti-oncogenic transcription factors, p53 and IRF-1, are required for distinct
apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we found that mitogen induction
of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (Ice) gene, a mammalian homolog of
the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, is also IRF-1-dependent. An
IRF-1 binding sequence was identified in the 5' flanking region of the Ice gene. 
In addition, ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the
endogenous Ice gene and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced
apoptosis. Thus, induction of Ice gene may be involved in IRF-1 dependent DNA
damage-induced apoptosis in activated mature T lymphocytes.

Upregulation of interferon-alpha receptor expression in hydroxyurea-treated
leukemia cell lines.

Tamura T(1), Matsuzaki M, Harada H, Ogawa K, Mohri H, Okubo T.

Author information: 
(1)First Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University School of
Medicine, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) shows its antitumor effect through
binding to specific cell surface receptors. A DNA synthesis inhibitor,
hydroxyurea (HU), has been successfully combined with IFN-alpha to improve the
efficiency of IFN therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). To understand
the mechanism of this combination effect, expression of IFN-alpha receptors on
the CML cell line, K562, was studied before and after treatment with HU.
METHODS: Cells were treated with HU at a dose of 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mmol/L for
48 hours. Binding assays were performed using 125I-labeled IFN-alpha at 4 degrees
C. Cell cycle analysis was carried out using flow cytometer following staining
cellular DNA with propidium iodide. Northern blot analysis was performed to
evaluate the inducibility of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene
expression by IFN-alpha.
RESULTS: Hydroxyurea-treated cells showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in 
binding of 125I-labeled IFN-alpha (maximal 2.5-fold). The increase of binding was
caused by an increase in the number of binding sites with a constant receptor
affinity. Similar results were obtained in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line,
Daudi. Cell cycle analyses suggested that upregulation of the IFN receptor may
have occurred as a result of the alteration in the cell cycle distribution.
Furthermore, IFN-alpha induction of the IFN-inducible gene IRF-1 mRNA in
HU-treated K562 cells was 2-fold higher than that in untreated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, HU may have an ability to enhance the response to IFN-alpha
probably because of its ability to upregulate the IFN-alpha receptors, suggesting
that this may be involved in the mechanism of effective combination therapy of
IFN-alpha with HU.

Jak3 is associated with CD40 and is critical for CD40 induction of gene
expression in B cells.

Hanissian SH(1), Geha RS.

Author information: 
(1)Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
Massachusetts 02115, USA.

CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival, growth, differentiation,
and isotype switching of B lymphocytes. Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine
kinase activity, its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is 
necessary for several CD40-mediated events. We show that engagement of CD40
induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3. Jak3
is constitutively associated with CD40, and this interaction requires a
proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40. Deletion of this
sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23, ICAM-1, and
lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells. These results indicate that signaling through
Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions.

A double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway mediating
stress-induced apoptosis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cancer Biology, Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.

Apoptosis occurs in response to different cellular stresses, including viral
infection, inflammatory cytokines, growth factor deprivation, and UV light, but
it is unclear whether these inducers share a common mechanism of induction. The
interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) has been
implicated in processes that rely on apoptosis as control mechanisms in vivo,
including antiviral activities, cell growth regulation, and tumorigenesis. Here
we report that mouse embryo fibroblasts from mutant mice containing homozygous
deletions in the PKR gene (Pkr(0/0) mice) were resistant to apoptotic cell death 
in response to double-stranded RNA, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or
lipopolysaccharide. The mechanism underlying the suppression of apoptosis in the 
Pkr(0/0) cells could be attributed to defects in the activation of DNA-binding
activity for the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 and in Fas
mRNA induction. Thus, these results provide genetic evidence implicating a
requirement for PKR in mediating different forms of stress-related apoptosis.

Listeria monocytogenes is widely used as a model to study immune responses
against intracellular bacteria. It has been shown that neutrophils and
macrophages play an important role to restrict bacterial replication in the early
phase of primary infection in mice, and that the cytokines interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are essential for
protection. However, the involved signaling pathways and effector mechanisms are 
still poorly understood. This study investigated mouse strains deficient for the 
IFN-dependent transcription factors interferon consensus sequence binding protein
(ICSBP), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1 or 2 for their capacity to
eliminate Listeria in vivo and in vitro and for production of inducible reactive 
nitrogen intermediates (RNI) or reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) in
macrophages. ICSBP-/- and to a lesser degree also IRF2-/- mice were highly
susceptible to Listeria infection. This correlated with impaired elimination of
Listeria from infected peritoneal macrophage (PEM) cultures stimulated with
IFN-gamma in vitro; in addition these cultures showed reduced and delayed
oxidative burst upon IFN-gamma stimulation, whereas nitric oxide production was
normal. In contrast, mice deficient for IRF1 were not able to produce nitric
oxide, but they efficiently controlled Listeria in vivo and in vitro. These
results indicate that (a) the ICSBP/IRF2 complex is essential for
IFN-gamma-mediated protection against Listeria and that (b) ROI together with
additional still unknown effector mechanisms may be responsible for the
anti-Listeria activity of macrophages, whereas IRF1-induced RNI are not limiting.

interferon-stimulated genes.

(1)Department of Hematology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, U.S.A.

The interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a positive transcriptional
regulatory protein which acts in the interferon signal transduction pathway to
activate the transcription of the type I interferon genes by binding to the PRDI 
response element. The aim of this study was to explore the role of IRF-1 in
regulating the expression of other interferon-stimulated genes in the interferon 
signal transduction pathway. A transient transfection assay was used to show that
IRF-1 induced the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. The induction was a 
direct result of IRF-1 binding to the promoters of the interferon-stimulated
response element (ISRE). The levels of endogenous mRNA of two
interferon-stimulated genes, 6-16 and 9-27, were increased in cells containing
increased levels of IRF-1. In addition, IRF-1 activates the expression of IRF-2, 
a negative regulator of the type I interferon genes themselves. Two sequences
were found in the IRF-2 promoter which were the binding sites for IRF-1.
Mutations in the oligonucleotide sequences of these sites could abolish the
binding of the IRF-1. These data suggested that IRF-1 not only plays an important
role in the induction of type I interferon genes, but also in the activation of
interferon-stimulated genes.

Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) has been studied on 3p (von Hippel-Lindau gene
locus), 5q and 17p (p53 gene locus) by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
strategy in 42 sporadic renal cell carcinomas (RCC). LOH at seven microsatellite 
loci on 5q was investigated because a tumor suppressor gene on 5q involved in the
development and/or progression of RCC has not yet been identified. LOH was found 
in seven (17%) RCC at single or multiple loci on 5q, 38% (11/29 informative
cases) on 3p, and 6% (2/35 informative cases) on 17p. Replication error (RER) was
present in 10% (4/42) RCC at single or multiple loci. The minimum region of
deletion on 5q to account for LOH was mapped to 5q31.1 (interferon regulatory
factor-1; IRF-1 locus), where LOH was detected in 23% (6/26 informative cases).
LOH on 3p and 5q occurred in both stage 2 and more advanced (stage 3 and 4)
tumors at similar incidences (41 and 33% on 3p; and 24 and 22% on 5q,
respectively), suggesting that LOH on these chromosomes is an early genetic
event. All RCC exhibiting LOH on 3p or 5q (IRF-1 locus) were the clear cell or
the mixed clear and granular cell types. These findings suggest that LOH on 3p
and 5q plays an important role in the genesis of clear cell RCC. In addition,
only one tumor exhibited LOH on both 3p and 5q, which suggests that LOH occurs
not sequentially but independently.

significantly stimulated growth of the fourth cell line, KAS-6/1. Our studies
have focused on elucidating the mechanism of differential IFN-alpha
responsiveness. First, we have shown that IFN-alpha-stimulated growth of the
KAS-6/1 cells did not result from induction of autocrine IL-6 expression. Second,
analysis of Stats 1, 2, and 3 and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2
activation failed to reveal differences between the IFN-alpha growth-arrested or 
growth-stimulated cells. Third, although IFN-alpha treatment of the IFN-alpha
growth-inhibited cell lines reduced IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression, IFN-alpha
also reduced KAS-6/1 IL-6R expression. Finally, although IFN-alpha treatment
reduced IL-6R numbers on each cell line, analysis of Stat protein activation
revealed that the receptors were still functional. We conclude that myeloma cell 
responsiveness to IFN-alpha is heterogeneous and that mechanisms of
IFN-alpha-mediated growth inhibition other than IL-6R downregulation must exist
in myeloma. Identification of these mechanisms may allow development of agents
that are more universally effective than IFN-alpha.

IFN-gamma has a direct antitumor effect on many tumor cell lines mediated through
the IFN-gammaR. One effect of IFN-gamma is to induce the nuclear transcription
factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), which may function as a tumor suppressor.
In this study, mouse IRF-1 cDNA under a high constitutive expression promoter was
transfected into the highly aggressive, nonimmunogenic MCA 101 murine sarcoma.
Clones were obtained by G418 selection and screened for IRF-1 mRNA expression by 
reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). High expression clones had high levels of two
MHC class I proteins (H-2Kb and H-2Db) on the cell surface that correlated with
increased levels of class I mRNA by RT-PCR. Furthermore, these clones also had
increased levels of MHC class II protein (I-Ab), which correlated with increased 
levels of one subunit of class II mRNA by RT-PCR. IRF-1-expressing clones had
markedly diminished cell growth in vitro and decreased anchorage-independent
growth in a soft agar assay. These clones also demonstrated markedly prolonged
tumor latency and slowed growth in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. IRF-1 gene-transfected
cells had shortened tumor latency and formed faster growing tumors in
gamma-irradiated immunodeficient mice compared with results in immunocompetent
mice. Mice immunized with IRF-1-transfected cells were protected against
subsequent challenge with IRF-1 transfected cells and also demonstrated greater
tumor latency and slower tumor growth against subsequent challenge with
untransfected cells compared with mice immunized with empty vector-transfected
cells. These studies demonstrate a tumor suppressor effect of IRF-1, which acts
in vivo through both partial reversion of the malignant phenotype and enhanced
immune recognition and may play a role in the antitumor effects of IFN-gamma.

Constitutive activation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 gene
transcription by IRF1 and IRF2 during restricted EBV latency.

School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 gene promoter active in the type I program of 
restricted viral latency was recently identified and shown to reside in the viral
BamHI Q fragment. This promoter, Qp, is active in a wide variety of cell lines
and has an architecture reminiscent of eukaryotic housekeeping gene promoters (B.
C. Schaefer, J. L. Strominger, and S. H. Speck, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
92:10565-10569, 1995; B. C. Schaefer, J. L. Strominger, and S. H. Speck, Mol.
Cell. Biol. 17:364-377, 1997). Here we demonstrate by deletion analysis that the 
important cis-acting elements regulating Qp are clustered in a relatively small
region (ca. 80 bp) surrounding the site of transcription initiation. Immediately 
upstream of the site of initiation is a region which is protected from DNase I
digestion by crude nuclear extracts. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses
(EMSA) employing probes spanning this region demonstrated the presence of two
major protein complexes. Deletion analysis of Qp demonstrated that at least one
of these complexes plays an important role in Qp activity. Evidence that
interferon response factor 2 (IRF2) is a major constituent of the most prominent 
EMSA complex and that IRF1 may be a minor component of this complex is presented.
Transfections into IRF1-/-, IRF2-/-, and IRF1,2-/- fibroblasts demonstrated that 
absence of both IRF1 and IRF2 reduced Qp activity to approximately the same
extent as mutation of the IRF-binding site in Qp, strongly implicating IRF2, and 
perhaps IRF1, in the regulation of Qp activity. Notably, transcription from Qp
was not inducible by either alpha or gamma interferon in EBV-negative B cells but
rather was shown to be constitutively activated by IRF1 and IRF2. This
observation suggests that IRF1 and IRF2 have a previously unrecognized role as
constitutive activators of specific genes. Additionally, data presented indicate 
that a protein complex containing the nonhistone architectural protein HMG-I(Y)
binds to the region identified as the major transcription initiation site for Qp.
This observation raises the possibility that HMG-I(Y)-induced DNA bending plays a
role in the initiation of transcription from Qp.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates
interferon-induced genes and type I interferons. Recently, studies of
IRF-l-deficient mice have revealed that IRF-I regulates the induction of
molecules that play important roles in inflammation, such as inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-l beta-converting enzyme (ICE). To study
the role of IRF-1 in autoimmunity, we investigated type II collagen-induced
arthritis (CIA), and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), in mice
lacking IRF-1. The incidence and severity of CIA were significantly decreased in 
IRF-1-/- mice compared with IRF-l +/- mice, as was the production of interferon
(IFN)-gamma in lymph node cells. Both IRF-l+/- and IRF-1-/- mice exhibited mild
and transient disease after adoptive transfer of a type II collagen
(CII)-specific T cell line together with sera from arthritic mice, but the
IRF-1-/- mice were less severely affected than the IRF-1+/- mice. In addition,
the incidence of EAE in IRF-1-/- mice was decreased as compared with IRF-1 +/-
mice. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that IRF-1 mRNA was 
constitutively expressed in the spinal cords of IRF-1+/- mice, and was
upregulated in mice with clinical EAE. Expression of iNOS was also detected in
inflamed spinal cords. These results suggest that IRF-I plays a key role in
promoting inflammation and autoimmunity in CIA and EAE animal models.

The interferon (IFN)-induced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated Ser/Thr
protein kinase (PKR) plays a role in the antiviral and antiproliferative effects 
of IFN. PKR phosphorylates initiation factor eIF2alpha, thereby inhibiting
protein synthesis, and also activates the transcription factor, nuclear
factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), by phosphorylating the inhibitor of NF-kappaB,
IkappaB. Mice devoid of functional PKR (Pkr(o/o)) derived by targeted gene
disruption exhibit a diminished response to IFN-gamma and poly(rI:rC) (pIC). In
embryo fibroblasts derived from Pkr(o/o) mice, interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF-1) or guanylate binding protein (Gbp) promoter-reporter constructs were
unresponsive to IFN-gamma or pIC but response could be restored by
co-transfection with PKR. The lack of responsiveness could be attributed to a
diminished activation of IRF-1 and/or NF-kappaB in response to IFN-gamma or pIC. 
Thus, PKR acts as a signal transducer for IFN-stimulated genes dependent on the
transcription factors IRF-1 and NF-kappaB.

A recessive mutant cell line, B7, which is partially responsive to both
interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma is described. B7 was FACS sorted from a
cellular pool, which was obtained from the parental cell line 2C4, after several 
rounds of mutagenesis. The partial responsiveness to IFN was observed both in
terms of expression of cell surface markers (CD2, class I and II HLAs) and mRNA
expression of IFN-stimulated genes (9-27; 6-16; 2'-5' OAS; GBP and HLA-DR alpha).
A genetic cross with the U4 mutant (JAK1-, a member of the Janus family of
nonreceptor tyrosine kinase) did not restore full IFN responsiveness to B7, and
JAK1 cDNA transfection into B7 restored the wild phenotype of the cell line,
defining B7 as a member of the U4 complementation group. Nevertheless, JAK1 mRNA 
was not detected in this mutant. Transcriptional regulator complexes such as
IRF1/2 (IFN-regulatory factor) and ISGF3-gamma (IFN-stimulated gene factor) were 
constitutively formed in the B7 mutant and co-migrated with the IFN-induced
complexes expressed in the parental cell line 2C4. Thus, this cell line seems to 
be useful for understanding cis-acting elements governing JAK1 mRNA expression.

IgA is transported into external secretions by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). 
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a major regulator of pIgR expression, has been
shown to increase pIgR mRNA levels in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. To
determine the molecular mechanisms of pIgR regulation, genomic DNA containing the
5'-flanking region of the human pIgR gene was isolated and a single start site of
transcription in human intestinal epithelial cells was identified. Using chimeric
reporter plasmids containing flanking regions of the pIgR gene, a segment of the 
pIgR promoter which is necessary and sufficient for induction of transcription by
IFN-gamma in HT-29 cells was identified. Significantly, the pIgR promoter
contains three motifs homologous to the interferon-stimulated response element
(ISRE), two in the 5'-flanking region and one in exon 1 of the pIgR gene. The
upstream ISREs bind nuclear protein(s) which are constitutively expressed by
HT-29 cells, while the exon 1 ISRE binds interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), 
following stimulation with IFN-gamma. Furthermore, induction of the IRF-1
promoter by IFN-gamma correlates with induction of the pIgR promoter by
IFN-gamma. It has previously been demonstrated that induction of pIgR mRNA by
IFN-gamma, requires de novo protein synthesis. It is now shown that IRF-1 is not 
detected in nuclear extracts from HT-29 cells stimulated with IFN-gamma in the
presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo synthesis of IRF-1 is required
for induction of pIgR transcription by IFN-gamma.

Suppressed induction of 2-5AS in cells with HTLV-I is not associated with the

alpha.

Some viruses seem to be capable of suppressing interferon (IFN)-induced
2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5AS) induction. Cells infected with human
T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) show different natures for the constitutive 
production of IFN-gamma or sensitivity to IFN. Poor induction of 2-5AS was found 
in IFN-gamma producer cells carrying HTLV-I (MT-1, MT-2 and SMT-1). On the other 
hand, in non- or low-producing cell lines of IFN-gamma such as HUT102 and OKM-2, 
significant activity of 2-5AS was induced by treatment with IFN-alpha. A
satisfactory level of IFN receptor was detectable in SMT-1 cells in spite of the 
poor induction of 2-5AS. There were no differences in either the interferon
regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) mRNA transcript or the level of STAT-1 alpha between 
SMT-1 and HUT102 cells. However, the transcription of IRF-1 mRNA was slightly
reduced in SMT-1 cells as compared with that of HUT102 cells.

X-ray treatment induces a complex molecular response in hematopoietic cells
leading to cell death. Using the mRNA differential display technique, we searched
for genes whose expression was modified by ionizing radiation (IR) in the human
p53-deficient leukemic cell line KG1a. We isolated a partial cDNA corresponding
to the interferon (IFN)-inducible 1-8d gene. The expression of both 1-8d and
9-27, another gene from the same IFN-inducible family, was increased 24 and 48 h 
following irradiation. We did not find enhancement of either IFNgamma mRNA or
interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) mRNA in irradiated KG1a cells, indicating 
that 1-8d and 9-27 enhancement was not due to an IFN activation. Thus, the
induction of IFN-inducible genes by IR may provide a link between
radiation-induced and IFN-mediated cell death.

Retinoic acid and IFN inhibition of cell proliferation is associated with
apoptosis in squamous carcinoma cell lines: role of IRF-1 and TGase II-dependent 
pathways.

Both retinoids and IFNs are known to inhibit proliferation of many normal and
transformed cells and to have an in vivo antitumor effect against a variety of
cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma. Because the combination of IFNs and
all-trans retinoic acid (RA) could improve their antitumor effectiveness
(depending on the histological origin and state of differentiation of the cells),
we compared the activity of RA and/or IFN-alpha 2b with regard to the mechanism
of growth inhibition of ME180 and SiHa cell lines, derived from squamous cervix
carcinoma at different stages of differentiation. We reported previously that, in
the ME180 cell line, the combined treatment significantly increased the growth
inhibitory effect of the single agents. Here, we show that the SiHa cell line
appears more sensitive to IFN-alpha 2b than the ME180 cell line, and resistant to
RA, which does not significantly inhibit SiHa cell growth. Induction of apoptotic
cell death clearly occurs and correlates with the inhibition of cell
proliferation in both cell lines. It is interesting that the induction of the
transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 correlates with the subsequent
induction of apoptosis, whereas TGase I and II expression does not. In
particular, TGase I and II appear differentially expressed in the ME180 and SiHa 
cell lines; i.e., TGase I is expressed in ME180 and specifically inhibited by RA,
whereas TGase II is expressed in SiHa. It is interesting that both IFN-alpha and 
RA are able to increase TGase II expression and activity in this cell line.

Hosts undergoing allograft rejection show increased MHC expression locally in the
graft and systemically in the normal host organs, mediated principally by
IFN-gamma. The transcription factor IRF-1 has been implicated in the regulation
of MHC expression by IFNs in vitro as well as in the regulation of production of 
some cytokines. We investigated the role of IRF-1 in vivo in the systemic
regulation of MHC expression in hosts undergoing rejection of allogeneic tumors
by comparing MHC induction in mice with normal IRF-1 genes (wild type or WT mice)
with mice with disrupted IRF-1 genes (IRF-1 knockout or IRF-1 KO mice). We
assessed MHC product expression by immunohistology and by radiolabeled antibody
binding to tissue homogenates, and MHC mRNA levels by Northern blotting. By
immunohistology in mice undergoing allogeneic stimulation by the ascites tumor
cells, kidneys of WT mice showed massive class I and II induction, but kidneys
from IRF-1 KO mice showed almost no class I and II induction. Allograft rejection
also increased class I and II product levels by radiolabeled antibody binding and
steady state mRNA levels, but again IRF-1 KO mice showed severe impairment of MHC
induction. Similar impaired MHC class I and II induction was seen in heart and
spleen, but in liver the IRF-1 mice showed impaired class I induction but
unimpaired class II induction. The results indicate that IRF-1 has an essential
role in both class I and class II MHC induction in allogeneic responses, but that
a component of IRF-1 independent MHC induction is also demonstrable in some
tissues. The reduction in MHC induction by allogeneic stimulation probably
reflects decreased response to IFN-gamma and other cytokines as well as some
reduction in the amount of cytokines produced.

Studies of hamster-human and mouse-human somatic fibroblast hybrids and
transfected mouse fibroblasts have demonstrated that signaling through the human 
interferon-gamma receptor (hu-IFN-gammaR) requires the formation of a complex
consisting of ligand (IFN-gamma), a ligand binding receptor chain (IFN-gammaR1), 
and a signal transducing receptor chain (IFN-gammaR2). To date, the ability of
this receptor complex to transduce the full repertoire of biological signals has 
been difficult to assess due to the limited number of activities that IFN-gamma
can exert on fibroblasts. The current report assesses the ability of
hu-IFN-gammaR chains to transduce signals in the absence of background human gene
products by expressing hu-IFN-gammaR2 in a transformed macrophage cell line
(F10/96) derived from a hu-IFN-gammaR1 transgenic mouse. Our results indicate
that F10/96 clones expressing both human receptor proteins bind hu-IFN-gamma with
an affinity comparable to that of human cells. Binding of either human or mouse
IFN-gamma to its respective receptor elicits classic IFN-gamma responses such as 
up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex antigens, enhanced expression
of IRF-1, and increased production of NO2- radicals, interleukin-6, tumor
necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor.
However, hu-IFN-gamma could not fully protect the clones from cytopathic effects 
of encephalomyocarditis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus while mo-IFN-gamma
could. These results demonstrate that while co-expression of hu-IFN-gammaR1 and
hu-IFN-gammaR2 is necessary and sufficient for most IFN-gamma-induced responses, 
it is not sufficient to confer a generalized antiviral state. These findings
further suggest that additional species-specific accessory factor(s) are
necessary for full signaling potential through the IFN-gamma receptor complex.
The nature and potential role of such factors in IFN-gammaR signaling is
discussed.

Interferon-gamma induces Ice gene expression and enhances cellular susceptibility
to apoptosis in the U937 leukemia cell line.

Medicine, Japan.

The roles of interferons (IFNs) in apoptosis are not fully understood. In this
study we show that in the U937 monoblastic leukemia cell line, pretreatment with 
IFN-gamma enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis triggered by gamma-irradiation or
antitumor agents (etoposide or adriamycin), as well as by anti-Fas antibody. In
addition, IFN-gamma caused an increased expression of the interleukin-1
beta-converting enzyme (Ice) gene, following strong induction of the interferon
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene, the product of which is a transcriptional
activator of the Ice gene. An inhibitor of ICE/Ced-3 family proteases,
Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, blocked apoptosis in control cells as well as in
IFN-gamma-pretreated cells. These results suggest that enhanced susceptibility of
IFN-gamma-pretreated cells to apoptosis is mediated through the induction of Ice 
by IRF-1. This pathway is not affected by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) since
neutralizing antibody against IL-1 beta failed to suppress the IFN-gamma-mediated
enhancement of cell death, and IL-1 beta itself did not mimic the effect of
IFN-gamma.

Type I (alpha,beta) and type II (gamma) IFNs elicit antiproliferative and
antiviral activities through two distinct transcription pathways involving 1) IRF
family proteins and ISGF3, and 2) STAT1. We have employed a dominant negative
strategy to study the role of IRF family proteins in eliciting the biologic
activities of IFN. A truncated IRF protein retaining the DNA-binding domain (DBD)
of ICSBP (a member of the IRF family) was stably transfected into U937 monocytic 
cells. Clones expressing DBD had markedly reduced ISRE-binding activity and were 
defective in expressing several type I IFN-inducible genes. STAT1 was one such
type I IFN-inducible gene whose expression was also inhibited in DBD clones. As a
result, the expression of several IFN-gamma-inducible genes was also inhibited in
these clones, indicating functional coupling of the type I and type II IFN
transcription pathways. Furthermore, DBD clones grew more slowly than control
clones and were refractory to antiproliferative effects of both types of IFNs. We
found that IFN treatment of U937 cells leads to a G1 arrest and an increase in
underphosphorylated retinoblastoma gene product. However, IFN treatment did not
change the cell cycle profile, nor retinoblastoma gene product phosphorylation
state in DBD clones. These data indicate that expression of DBD disrupts cell
cycle regulatory mechanisms. Combined with the previously noted failure of DBD
clones to elicit antiviral activity, the present work shows that IRF family
proteins play an integral part in growth control activities of IFNs.

The role of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in the regulation of IFN-gamma
signaling in neural cells.

Massa PT(1), Wu C.

Author information: 
(1)The State University of New York, Health Science Center, Department of
Neurology, Syracuse 13210, USA.

The role for protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in controlling signal
transduction by IFN-gamma in astrocytes was studied. IFN-gamma induced the
gamma-activated factor (GAF) within 30 min and GAF subsequently declined by 8 h
after treatment. However, treatment with IFN-gamma in the presence of protein
tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate blocked the decrease in GAF activity. The
increased stability of GAF in vanadate-treated cultures was similarly observed in
astrocytes of motheaten mice, which specifically lack the protein tyrosine
phosphatase SHP-1. Prolongation of GAF activity coincided with increased
expression of the IFN-inducible transcription factor, IFN-regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1). Increased IRF-1 was coincident with increased expression of MHC class I 
molecules in astrocytes in accordance with the activity of IRF-1 in the promoter 
region. These data implicate an important role for protein tyrosine phosphatases,
including SHP-1, in the regulation of IFN-gamma-signaling and IFN-gamma-inducible
genes in neural cells.

The locus-specific enhancer activity of the class I major histocompatibility
complex interferon-responsive element is associated with a gamma-interferon
(IFN)-inducible factor distinct from STAT1alpha, p48, and IFN regulatory
factor-1.

Vallejo AN(1), Pease LR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic-Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, 
USA.

Recent analyses of the upstream regulatory regions of the class I major
histocompatibility complex genes in higher primates provided a generalized
structural basis for the differential expression of A- and B-locus gene products 
in response to specific physiological stimulus. Among the regulatory sequences
that differ between the loci is the interferon-responsive element (IRE). While
the B-IRE is conserved, the A-IREs have species-specific sequence variation. We
previously demonstrated that the B-IRE was an interferon (IFN)-inducible
enhancer, whereas none of the A-IREs were functional. In the present study, we
examined the biochemical basis for the enhancer activity of the conserved B-IRE
and found that this may be attributed to a novel gamma-IFN-inducible factor. This
factor accumulated in nuclei of cells within minutes of exposure to gamma-IFN.
Its appearance was independent of de novo protein synthesis. However, it was not 
detected in nuclei of cells treated with herbimycin A, suggesting that its
appearance depends on a protein kinase activation pathway. Supershift assays
indicated that it was distinct from STAT1alpha, IFN regulatory factor-1, and p48,
transcription factors known to bind IRE-like sequences found in regulatory
regions of many non-major histocompatibility complex gamma-IFN-responsive genes. 
Competition assays show that this novel factor bound B-IRE with relatively high
affinity, about 100-fold more than that for the A-IRE sequence. This factor was
also present in STAT1alpha and p48 somatic mutants that also exhibited B-IRE
enhancer activity in reporter gene bioassays in a manner similar to those seen
with wild type cells. These observations indicate the existence of a novel
gamma-IFN-dependent transcriptional activation pathway that correlates with the
differential enhancer activity of the HLA-B IRE.

The IRG-47 gene is the prototype for a new family of genes encoding guanine
nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins) which are selectively induced in
different cell lineages in response to activation signals. The IRG-47 gene is
rapidly and transiently induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in cells of the B
lymphocyte lineage and in stromal cells and fibroblasts. Here we report features 
controlling the uninduced and IFN-gamma-induced expression of the IRG-47 gene.
The minimal IFN-gamma-inducible IRG-47 gene promoter is 96 bp long and contains a
TATA box and an ISRE motif with an internal IRF-1/IRF-2 motif. Mutation of the
ISRE motif abolishes IFN-gamma induction by the minimal promoter. Constitutively 
expressed IRF-2 and IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1 factors specifically bind to the
wild-type, but not the mutated ISRE motif. An upstream region containing two
tandemly repeated YY1 motifs represses the expression of the IRG-47 promoter in
uninduced cells and determines the magnitude of IRG-47 promoter activity in
IFN-gamma-induced cells. The IRG-47 minimal promoter has the same functional
features and organization as the IFN-gamma-inducible promoters of the unrelated
murine GBP G-protein multigene family.

Role of interferon regulatory factor-1 in the induction of biliary glycoprotein
(cell CAM-1) by interferon-gamma.

Biliary glycoprotein (BGP), also known as C-CAM-1, has been shown to be
down-regulated in colon and prostate tumors. Previously, we demonstrated that BGP
mRNA is up-regulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in colon cancer cell lines
(Takahashi, H., Okai, Y., Paxton, R. J., Hefta, L. J. F., and Shively, J. E.
(1993) Cancer Res. 53, 1612-1619). We now show that the BGP promoter contains an 
interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) that is specifically protected in in
vivo footprints. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was identified as the
ISRE-binding factor by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The induction of
IRF-1 mRNA by IFN-gamma in HT-29 cells reaches a maximum at 6 h and is
superinduced by cycloheximide. Four mRNA species for BGP are induced by
IFN-gamma, the major band of which is inhibited by cycloheximide. Transfection of
HT-29 cells with an IRF-1 expression plasmid (pAct-1) transactivates a BGP
promoter reporter gene containing wild-type (but not mutant) ISRE.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of a second footprint reveals the
binding of Sp1, an Sp1-like protein, and upstream stimulatory factor. The
Sp1-like complex was also induced by IFN-gamma treatment of HT-29 cells and may
be a second point of transcriptional control for the BGP gene.

Synergistic effect of prolactin on IFN-gamma-mediated growth arrest in human
monoblastic cells: correlation with the up-regulation of IFN-gamma receptor gene 
expression.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulates the development of monocytic features in 
human myeloid precursors. Because transcriptional regulation of IFN-gamma and the
pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL) has been described to involve common Jak-STAT
pathways, we addressed here the question of whether PRL plays a role in
monoblastic (U937) cell growth and macrophage maturation. In contrast to
IFN-gamma, PRL did not affect U937 cell growth nor induction of differentiation
as assessed by the unchanged cell surface expression of maturation markers CD11b 
and HLA-DR class II. However, PRL in synergy with IFN-gamma inhibited, in a time-
and dose-dependence, proliferation of U937 cells without influencing their
maturation induced by IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma and PRL both affected the expression
of the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R) gene by increasing IFN-gamma R mRNA
levels. The rise in IFN-gamma R transcripts was accompanied by a low but
significant release of IL-6 which has previously been shown to stabilize
IFN-gamma R mRNA. Moreover, a transient increase in surface expression of
IFN-gamma R was observed in U937 cells treated by IFN-gamma alone or in
combination with PRL, whereas no apparent modulation of cell surface IFN-gamma R 
was observed in cells treated with PRL. Lastly, PRL did not induce
transcriptional activation in IFN-gamma inducible IRF-1 and Fc gamma RI genes in 
U937 cells. Together, our data indicate that IL-6 secretion and increased
expression of the IFN-gamma R gene correlate with U937 cell growth arrest induced
by IFN-gamma and PRL, probably through a signaling mechanism which does not
involve the Stat 1/IRF-1 pathway.

Effect of cycloheximide on the expression of LPS-inducible iNOS, IFN-beta, and
IRF-1 genes in J774 macrophages.

The effect of cycloheximide (CHX) on the gene expression for inducible NO
synthase (iNOS), interferon (IFN)-beta, and IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1 was
examined in LPS-stimulated J774 macrophages. LPS caused increased expression of
mRNAs specific for iNOS, IFN-beta, and IRF-1 with different kinetics. Addition of
CHX resulted in inhibition of the LPS-induced iNOS gene expression and parallel
decrease in NO production. In contrast, expression of IFN-beta and IRF-1 genes in
response to LPS was potentiated in the presence of CHX. These results indicate
that de novo protein synthesis is not required for IFN-beta and IRF-1 gene
expression and that ongoing protein synthesis including IFN-beta and IRF-1 may be
involved in the induction process of iNOS in mouse macrophages.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 is essential for natural 
killer cell function in vivo.

The activation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes capable of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted killing and early antiviral
defense, is temporally related to the increased interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta
production that is seen in the viral infection of mice. Type I IFN
(IFN-alpha/beta) are expressed in many cell types early after primary viral
infection and have been shown to mediate resistance against a variety of viruses.
In this study, the role of the transcriptional activator IFN regulatory factor-1 
(IRF-1) in murine NK cell activity was assessed. IRF-1-deficient mice displayed a
normal frequency of NK marker-positive cells, but exhibited greatly reduced NK
cell-mediated cytotoxicity after both virus infection and stimulation with the
IFN inducer polyinosinic:polycytidilic acid in vivo. In vitro, cytolytic activity
in IRF-1-deficient NK cells remained defective after stimulation with IFN-beta,
IL-2, and IL-12. IRF-1-deficient mice were unable to eliminate syngeneic MHC
class I-negative tumor cells in vivo, and had a reduced ability to reject
parental semi-allogeneic donor cells from the circulation. Thus, IRF-1 is
essential for the induction of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and for the in vivo 
effector functions that are mediated by this activity.

Interferon regulatory factors and TFIIB cooperatively regulate
interferon-responsive promoter activity in vivo and in vitro.

(1)Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health 
and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) bind to the interferon-stimulated response
element (ISRE) and regulate interferon- and virus-mediated gene expression. IRF-1
acts as a transcriptional activator, while IRF-2 acts as a repressor. Here we
show that IRF-1 and IRF-2 bind to both cellular TFIIB, a component of the basal
transcription machinery, and recombinant TFIIB (rTFIIB) and that this
protein-protein interaction facilitates binding of IRFs to the ISRE. A functional
interaction between TFIIB and IRF was assessed by a newly established in vitro
transcription assay in which recombinant IRF-1 (rIRF-1) stimulated transcription 
specifically from an ISRE-containing template. With this assay we show that
rIRF-1 and rTFIIB cooperatively enhance the ISRE promoter in vitro. We found that
the activity of an ISRE-containing promoter was cooperatively enhanced upon
cotransfection of TFIIB and IRF-1 cDNAs into P19 embryonal carcinoma cells,
further demonstrating functional interactions in vivo. The cooperative
enhancement by TFIIB and IRF-1 was independent of the TATA sequence in the ISRE
promoter but dependent on the initiator sequence (Inr) and was abolished when P19
cells were induced to differentiate by retinoic acid treatment. In contrast,
cotransfection of TFIIB and IRF-1 into NIH 3T3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent
repression of promoter activation which occurred in a TATA-dependent manner. Our 
results indicate the presence of a cell type-specific factor that mediates the
functional interaction between IRFs and TFIIB and that acts in conjunction with
the requirement of TATA and Inr for promoter activation.

Modulation of major histocompatibility complex class I genes by interferon-gamma 
and ganglioside GT 1b in astrocytes: involvement of protein tyrosine
phosphatases.

Massa PT(1), Wu C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, State University of New York, Health Science Center, 
Syracuse 13210, USA.

We have previously reported that the polysialoganglioside GT1b suppresses the
induction of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules by
interferon-gamma in astrocytes. Suppression by GT1b depended on the presence of
sialic acid moieties because asialo-GM1 was not suppressive. In the present
report, GT1b was found to act transcriptionally to suppress class I genes because
both the interferon-gamma induction of RNA and the activity of class I promoter
constructs were inhibited. Furthermore, GT1b suppressed promoter activity through
interferon regulatory factor elements, indicating an effect on the transcription 
activation factor, interferon regulatory factor 1. Interferon-gamma induced
interferon regulatory factor 1 within 8 h, and GT1b suppressed this induction.
The suppression of interferon regulatory factor 1 by GT1b correlated with the
suppression of gamma-activated factor binding at the promoter of the interferon
regulatory factor 1 gene. The suppression of gamma-activated factor by GT1b
appeared to involve increased protein tyrosine phosphatase activity because
treatment of the cells with pervanadate reversed the effect of GT1b on the
gamma-activated factor and, correspondingly, phosphotyrosine content. In sum,
GT1b displays specific effects on interferon-gamma signaling and negative
feedback regulatory molecules in astrocytes.

Differential expression of inducible NO synthase in two murine macrophage cell
lines.

Author information:

Although primary macrophages and most murine macrophage cell lines such as RAW
264.7 cells respond to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) by producing large amounts of nitrite, i.e. the oxidation product of nitric
oxide (NO) produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS), other cell lines like
P388.D1 cells do not produce significant amounts. To gain insight into the
signalling pathway that leads to the induction of iNOS activity, we compared iNOS
expression in RAW 264.7 and P388.D1 cells. We showed that IFN-gamma binds to each
cell line with a similar affinity. Furthermore, no differences in iNOS gene
structure were detectable by Southern blot analysis. Even though no significant
nitrite secretion was found in the supernatant of P388:D1 cells stimulated with
IFN-gamma and/or LPS, iNOS mRNA expression was induced. In addition, IFN-gamma
induced the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene and activated the binding
of this factor to its target sequence in the iNOS gene. This binding was recently
shown to be necessary for iNOS expression. However, in P388.D1 cells, we were
unable to detect the corresponding iNOS protein. These results indicate a
deficiency in P388.D1 cells which appears to be restricted to the signalling
pathway controlling iNOS protein synthesis. This deficiency does not affect the
overall IFN-gamma biological response, but rather a convergent
post-transcriptional step common to IFN-gamma and LPS.

Regulation of LMP2 and TAP1 genes by IRF-1 explains the paucity of CD8+ T cells
in IRF-1-/- mice.

Hill 27599, USA.

The TAP1 and LMP2 genes are central for class I MHC function and share a common
promoter. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanism of IFN gamma up-regulation of 
TAP1 and LMP2. In vivo footprinting indicates IFN gamma up-regulates protein-DNA 
contacts at an IRF-E that is essential for the up-regulation of TAP1 and LMP2 by 
IFN gamma. Gel shift analysis indicates that this site binds IRF-1. The
expression of TAP1 and LMP2 are both greatly reduced in IRF-1-deficient mice.
Surface class I MHC as well as CD8+ T cells are reduced in IRF-1-/- mice. The
role of IRF-1 in the regulation of TAP1 and LMP2 suggests a mechanism for the
antiviral properties of IRF-1 and the unexpected deficiency of CD8+ T cells
observed in IRF-1-/- mice.

Effects of adenovirus E1A protein on interferon-signaling.

Leonard GT(1), Sen GC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.

We have previously shown that adenovirus E1A proteins can block interferon-alpha 
(IFN-alpha)-signalling. In the current study, we examined if the same is true for
IFN-gamma signaling. Cotransfection experiments showed that both 289R and 243R
forms of E1A could block the expression of an IFN-gamma-inducible reporter gene. 
Similarly, in an E1A-expressing HeLa cell line IFN-gamma failed to induce the
synthesis of IRF-1 mRNA. This failure was due to a block in activation of the
crucial trans-acting factor, GAF, which in turn was due to the lack of
IFN-gamma-activated tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT1 alpha protein in
E1A-expressing cells. The above defect could be attributed to a reduced level of 
STAT1 alpha protein. The level of p48 protein, which is required for IFN-alpha
signaling, was also lowered. However, the level of lak-1 protein, one of the
tyrosine kinases necessary for both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma signalling, was
comparable in the E1A-expressing and the control cells. These results indicate
that the observed inhibition of IFN signalling in E1A-expressing cells is a
consequence of a lower abundance of the necessary trnas-acting factors.

Interferon regulatory factor-2 directs transcription from the gp91phox promoter.

Luo W(1), Skalnik DG.

Author information: 
(1)Herman B. Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Section of Pediatric
Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana
46202-5225, USA.

Repressor elements in the gp91(phox) promoter are necessary to restrict
tissue-specific transcription to mature phagocytes. Deletion of these elements
leads to significant promoter activity in cell lines such as HEL and K562 that do
not normally express gp91(phox). The -100 to +12 base pair gp91(phox) promoter
region is sufficient to direct maximal de-repressed transcription in these cells.
However, promoter activity is dramatically decreased following a 16-base pair
truncation that deletes an interferon-stimulated response element. This element
interacts with IRF-1 and IRF-2, members of the interferon regulatory factor
family of transcription factors. In addition, this promoter region is bound by a 
factor with properties similar to BID, a DNA-binding protein that also interacts 
with three upstream sites within the gp91(phox) promoter. Transient transfection 
studies using mutated promoters indicate that both the IRF and BID binding sites 
are required for maximal gp91(phox) promoter activity. Overexpression of IRF-1 or
IRF-2 in K562 cells leads to transactivation of gp91(phox) promoter constructs,
which is dependent on the presence of an intact IRF binding site. IRF-2
predominates in macrophages that express the gp91(phox) gene as well as in HEL
and K562 cells. We conclude that IRF-2 and BID activate gp91(phox) promoter
activity in the absence of transcriptional repression.

Delayed tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear expression of STAT1 following
antigen receptor stimulation of B lymphocytes.

Karras JG(1), Huo L, Wang Z, Frank DA, Zimmet JM, Rothstein TL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Boston University Medical Center, MA 02118, USA.

The regulation of the STAT1 alpha transcription factor was assessed during B cell
activation induced by cross-linking the surface IgM Ag receptor. Surface Ig
ligation or pharmacologic stimulation with PMA and ionomycin resulted in the
delayed (2-3 h after stimulation) nuclear appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated
STAT1 alpha, in contrast to the rapid induction that follows cytokine treatment. 
Nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT1 alpha was abrogated by co-incubation
of anti-Ig-treated B cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX), with the protein kinase inhibitor H-7, or with the immunosuppressive drug 
rapamycin. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 alpha was found to be recruited to the
STAT binding site of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene promoter only after
2 to 3 h, and this association was also inhibitable by CHX and rapamycin. The
arrival of STAT1 alpha coincided with attenuation of anti-Ig-induced STAT-binding
activity specific for the IRF-1 promoter site, and both rapamycin and CHX
treatment counteracted the loss of this activity. Furthermore, basal
transcription of the endogenous IRF-1 gene was decreased as a result of anti-Ig
treatment, and this effect of anti-Ig was blocked by co-incubation with
rapamycin. Thus, STAT1 alpha plays a dynamic role in the composition of IRF-1
promoter-specific DNA binding complexes stimulated by B cell Ag receptor
ligation, and nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT1 alpha is regulated in a 
unique fashion by Ag receptor engagement. In addition, surface Ig cross-linking
imparts negative regulatory control of IRF-1 gene expression, possibly through
activation of STAT1 alpha.

Normally growing cells promptly cease DNA synthesis when exposed to genotoxic
stresses, such as radiation, and this cell-cycle arrest prevents the accumulation
of mutations. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 is
essential for the regulation of the interferon system, inhibits cell growth, and 
manifests tumour-suppressor activities. Here we show that mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (EFs) lacking IRF-1 are deficient in their ability to undergo
DNA-damage-induced cell-cycle arrest. A similar phenotype has been observed in
EFs lacking the tumour suppressor p53 (refs 8, 9), although the expression of
IRF-1 and p53 are independent of one another. Furthermore, we show that
transcriptional induction of the gene encoding p21 (WAF1, CIP1), a cell-cycle
inhibitor, by gamma-irradiation is dependent on both p53 and IRF-1, and that the 
p21 promoter is activated, either directly or indirectly, by both in a transient 
cotransfection assay. These two tumour-suppressor transcription factors therefore
converge functionally to regulate the cell cycle through the activation of a
common target gene.

Cooperative role of interferon regulatory factor 1 and p91 (STAT1) response
elements in interferon-gamma-inducible expression of human indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase gene.

Chon SY(1), Hassanain HH, Gupta SL.

Author information: 
(1)Hipple Cancer Research Center, Dayton, Ohio 45439, USA.

Interferon (IFN)-gamma induces the expression of the indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase
(INDO) gene in human cells, which plays a role in the inhibitory effect of
IFN-gamma on intracellular pathogens and on cell proliferation. Earlier studies
established that the IFN-gamma-inducible expression of the INDO gene was
dependent on two upstream elements: (i) a 14-base pair sequence homologous to an 
interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) sequence found in
IFN-alpha-inducible genes and (ii) a 9-base pair palindromic sequence
(palindromic element (PE) II) homologous to an interferon-gamma-activated site
(GAS) element found in IFN-gamma-inducible genes. A second GAS element (PE I),
between ISRE and PE II, was ineffective in supporting a response to IFN-gamma.
Studies were carried out to determine the distinction between the two GAS
elements and the relative role of the two elements (ISRE and PE II) required for 
a response to IFN-gamma. The PE I element was able to form a complex with
IFN-gamma-activated p91 (STAT1) factor but with lower efficiency than the complex
formed with PE II sequence. However, switching the positions of PE I and II
sequences in reporter plasmid constructs (containing chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase gene) showed that both PE I and PE II were able to support a
response to IFN-gamma if located at the position of PE II but not at the position
of PE I. Increasing the distance between the ISRE and PE II also affected the
level of response, suggesting that the relative position of the two elements is
important for optimal stimulus. To explore whether an interaction between the
IFN-gamma-regulated factors (IRF-1 and p91) binding to the ISRE and PE II might
be important, we tested whether the ISRE sequence could be replaced by another
response element, NF-kappaB. The plasmid construct with NF-kappaB element in
place of the ISRE was responsive to IFN-gamma, indicating that an interaction
between the IRF-1 and p91 factors was not required. The results indicate that the
response of INDO gene to IFN-gamma depends on a cooperative role of
IFN-gamma-responsive factors binding to the ISRE and GAS elements.

Autocrine amplification of type I interferon gene expression mediated by
interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3).

Science.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 have been implicated for the
virus-induced expression of the interferon-alpha and beta (type I IFN) genes.
However, recent gene disruption studies in mice suggested the presence of other
factor(s) interacting with overlapping promoter elements. In the present paper,
we describe the characterization of a DNA binding factor which is strongly
induced after virus infection and recognizes these promoter elements. After
extensive purification, the factor was revealed to be identical to IFN-stimulated
gene factor 3 (ISGF3), a transcription factor complex activated by IFN treatment.
ISGF3 binds to the promoter element of IFN-beta, positive regulatory domain I
(PRDI), with significantly higher affinity than IRF-1, 2, and mutational analysis
of PRDI showed that the gene expression and binding of ISGF3, but not of IRF-1,
2, are highly correlated. Furthermore, our functional analysis involving a
dominant negative inhibitor for ISGF3 activation and an anti-IFN neutralizing
antibody clearly demonstrated the presence of a positive feedback path way for
type I IFN genes mediated by ISGF3.

Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) acts as a transcriptional activator in
interferon system and as a tumor suppressor. The loss of functional IRF-1 has
been shown in approximately 30% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
and overt leukemia from MDS. Here we report an alternative mechanism of
inactivation of IRF-1 activity. We identified an IRF-1 binding protein (IRF-BP). 
Protein sequencing revealed that IRF-BP was identical to nucleophosmin (NPM), a
nucleolar phosphoprotein. Functional analysis showed that IRF-BP inhibited
DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of IRF-1. Moreover when we examined
several leukemia samples, the level of IRF-BP mRNA was increased. These results
are consistent with the hypothesis that IRF-BP binds to IRF-1, and that
overexpression of IRF-BP in leukemias leads to escape from IRF-1-regulated growth
control. This hypothesis was also supported by the fact that overexpression of
IRF-BP in NIH 3T3 cells rendered cells transformed.

Retinoic acid activates interferon regulatory factor-1 gene expression in myeloid
cells.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo
differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes. However, the molecular
mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular
differentiation are not presently understood. The NB4 cell line, which is derived
from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse, can be used as a model
system to study the growth and differentiation of APL cells. Because interferon
(IFN) regulatory factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2) and other IFN-inducible gene products 
regulate cell growth, we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these 
genes. We show that ATRA directly activates IRF-1 gene expression, followed by
activation of IRF-2 and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene expression
with slower kinetics. In addition to NB4 cells, ATRA also activated IRF-1 gene
expression in HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells, which all respond to ATRA by growth
inhibition. A more than additive increase in IRF-1 gene expression was seen with 
ATRA and IFN-gamma in NB4 cells. ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation pathways,
suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF-1 gene activation. The 
ATRA-induced expression of IRF-1, an activator of transcription and repressor of 
transformation, may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth
inhibition, and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs in myeloid
leukemia cells.

number of cell types, and binds to a consensus sequence defined in part by the
IFN-gamma activation site (GAS). It is not known whether these transcription
factors respond to other kinds of growth stimuli, and, with particular relevance 
to lymphocytes, it is not known whether STAT proteins participate in Ag-specific 
responses. To determine the role of STAT proteins, coupling between Ag-receptor
cross-linking and nuclear expression of DNA-binding protein complexes that
recognize GAS sequences was evaluated. Ag-receptor triggering in primary B
lymphocytes stimulated nuclear expression of a complex that specifically binds
the IFN response factor-1 (IRF-1) GAS sequence, and is distinguished by
electrophoretic mobility and GAS preference from IRF-1 GAS-binding complexes
induced by IFN-gamma. Activation of nuclear IRF-1 GAS-binding activity by sIg was
inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, and binding activity
was eliminated by tyrosine phosphatase treatment. Activation of IRF-1 GAS-binding
activity was blocked by depletion of protein kinase C. The IRF-1 GAS-binding
activity induced by sIg engagement in B cells was transcriptionally active, and
was found to consist of immunoreactive STAT5 and STAT6 proteins. This work
demonstrates that the STAT signaling pathway previously associated with cytokine 
signaling is triggered in B lymphocytes through Ag-receptor engagement in a
protein kinase C-dependent fashion. This heretofore described cytokine signaling 
pathway may play a role in bringing about Ag-specific proliferative and
differentiative responses.

Identification of the lysyl oxidase gene as target of the antioncogenic
transcription factor, IRF-1, and its possible role in tumor suppression.

(1)Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.

The transcriptional activator IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and its
antagonistic repressor IRF-2 are regulators of the IFN system. IRF-1 also
manifests tumor suppressive activity, and its inactivation could contribute to
the development of human hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we report the
identification of the lysyl oxidase gene as a target gene of IRF-1. An IRF
response element was identified in the lysyl oxidase gene promoter. We also
demonstrate that the transformed phenotype of ras-expressing embryonic
fibroblasts with a null mutation in the IRF-1 allele could be suppressed by the
expression of the lysyl oxidase cDNA, implicating its potential role in tumor
suppression. Thus, the regulation of the lysyl oxidase gene by IRF-1 could
contribute to the multistep process of malignant transformation.

Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a transcription factor
of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family. Evidence indicates that this family
has a function in the immune system. Unlike other members of the family, ICSBP is
expressed exclusively in the immune system. In this work, immunoblot analysis was
performed to study expression of ICSBP and other members of the family in various
murine lymphocytes. The results show that all IRF family members are expressed
constitutively in B cells throughout development, and in resting and activated
cells. In contrast, ICSBP expression was undetectable in thymocytes and resting T
cells, while all other IRF proteins tested (IRF-1, IRF-2, and ISGF3-gamma) were
detected in these cells. Induction of ICSBP (and weakly IRF-1, but not other
members) was observed upon activation of T cells following anti-CD3 Ab binding or
Con A stimulation. Once T cells were activated, ICSBP was expressed stably in
both Th1 and Th2 cells. We show that Stat-1, which binds to the
IFN-gamma-responsive element of the ICSBP promoter, was induced following
anti-CD3 Ab and Con A stimulation. Stat-1 induction was found in T cells of
IFN-gamma+/+, but not of IFN-gamma-/- mice, indicating that T cell activation
stimulates the Stat pathway of transcription that is mediated through IFN-gamma. 
IFN-gamma-activated Stat-1 partly accounted for ICSBP induction in activated T
cells, as levels of induction were lower in IFN-gamma-/- than in IFN+/+ T cells. 
Taken together, these results show that activation of ICSBP is coupled with T
cell activation that is partly due to IFN-gamma-induced Stat-1.

In vivo footprinting of the mouse inducible nitric oxide synthase gene: inducible
protein occupation of numerous sites including Oct and NF-IL6.

Médecine, Dijon, France.

A wide variety of cells usefully but sometimes destructively produce nitric oxide
via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Data obtained by gel shift analysis
and reporter assays have linked murine iNOS gene induction by cytokines and
bacterial products with the binding of a number of proteins to a proximal
promoter, as well as to a distal enhancer of the iNOS gene. Nevertheless, these
techniques do not necessarily reflect protein occupation of sites in vivo. To
address this, we have used dimethyl sulphate in vivo footprinting to determine
binding events in the two murine iNOS transcription control regions, using a
classical lipopolysaccharide induction of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Protein-DNA
interactions are absent before activation. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide induces
protection at a NF-kappaB site and hypersensitivity at a shared gamma-activated
site/interferon-stimulated response element within the enhancer. Protections are 
seen at a NF-IL6, and an Oct site within the promoter. We also observe
modulations in guanine methylation at two regions which do not correspond to any 
known putative binding elements. Furthermore, we confirm the probable involvement
of interferon regulatory factor-1 (binding to its -901 to -913 site) and the
binding of NF-kappaB to its proximal site. Our data demonstrate an abundance of
hitherto-unrecognised protein-DNA binding events upon simple lipopolysaccharide
activation of the iNOS gene and suggests a role for protein-protein interactions 
in its transcriptional induction.

Kinetically coordinated induction of TAP1 and HLA class I by IFN-gamma: the rapid
induction of TAP1 by IFN-gamma is mediated by Stat1 alpha.

Min W(1), Pober JS, Johnson DR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Yale Medical School, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.

Transporter associated with Ag processing-1 (TAP1) is induced by IFN-gamma more
rapidly than is HLA class I. Kinetic analysis of transfectants reveals that
IFN-gamma activates the TAP1 promoter more rapidly than the HLA-B7 class I
promoter. A gamma-activating sequence (GAS) in the TAP1 promoter is necessary for
the rapid induction by IFN-gamma. Two overlapping IFN consensus sequences
contribute to the constitutive and TNF-induced expression of TAP1 but are not
necessary for the IFN-gamma response. Moreover, IFN-gamma activates the
GAS-binding protein Stat1 alpha much more rapidly than it induces the IFN
consensus sequence-binding protein IRF-1, which mediates the response of the
HLA-B7 class I promoter. We conclude that IFN-gamma uses different transcription 
factors to regulate the sequence of appearance of these interacting gene
products.

Differential dysregulation of nitric oxide production in macrophages with

Recent studies have reported that IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) regulates
nitric oxide (NO.) production in murine macrophages (M phi). Since IRF-2
recognizes the same consensus sequence as IRF-1, we postulated that IRF-2 may
also regulate NO.. Therefore, the ability of M phi from INF-2 homozygous
(IRF-2-/-) and heterozygous (IRF-2+/-) knockout mice to produce NO. following LPS
and/or IFN-gamma stimulation was compared with the responses of IRF-1-/-,
IRF-1+/-, and C57BL/6+/+ M phi. IRF-2-/- M phi produced less LPS-induced NO2-
than IRF-2+/- or C57BL/6 M phi. LPS and IFN-gamma synergized to increase NO2-
production from IRF-2-/- M phi to approximately 50% of IRF-2+/- and C57BL/6
levels. Unexpectedly, IRF-2-/-, IRF-2+/- and C57BL/6 M phi produced comparable
levels of inducible NO synthase mRNA in response to treatment with LPS and
IFN-gamma. IRF-1-/- M phi produced barely detectable NO2- and low, but
detectable, inducible NO. synthase mRNA in response to IFN-gamma and LPS. These
results indicate that IRF-1 and IRF-2 differ in their mechanism of NO. regulation
and that IRF-2 regulates inducible NO. synthase post-transcriptionally.

Expression of the protein kinase PKR in modulated by IRF-1 and is reduced in 5q- 
associated leukemias.

Beretta L(1), Gabbay M, Berger R, Hanash SM, Sonenberg N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

The transcription factor IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) is an activator
of type I interferon and interferon-inducible genes. IRF-1 manifests tumor
suppressor activity. Its overexpression results in inhibition of cell growth, and
deletions of the IRF-1 gene were demonstrated in a number of human leukemias and 
myelodysplasias. Although the mechanism by which IRF-1 affects cell growth is
unknown, it is believed that IRF-1 activates a set of genes that negatively
regulate cell growth. The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR),
which is an interferon-inducible gene, contains a promoter element for the
binding of IRF-1 and exhibits antiproliferative properties. Consequently, we
investigated the role of IRF-1 in PKR expression. Here, we show that in
IRF-1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts, PKR expression is reduced relative to
wild-type cells. This result predicts diminished expression of PKR as a potential
consequence of deletion of the IRF-1 gene in human leukemias. We show that cells 
of the human leukemic U937 cell line contain a deletion of one IRF-1 gene and
express low levels of PKR. We demonstrate that upregulation of IRF-1 expression
in U937 cells by transfection is sufficient to induce PKR expression. We also
found a marked reduction in the expression of PKR in blood samples from two
patients with myelodysplasias, carrying a deletion of chromosome 5q, a locus to
which IRF-1 was mapped. These results show that IRF-1 activates PKR expression
and suggest that loss of one allele of the IRF-1 gene is sufficient to affect PKR
expression. Therefore, PKR is a strong candidate for a mediator of the tumor
suppressor activity of IRF-1.

IFN-gamma induces the kappa intron enhancer via an IFN-stimulated response
element.

Damore MA(1), Omori SA, Wall R.

Author information: 
(1)Molecular Biology Insitute, University of California, Los Angeles 90095, USA.

IFN-gamma is a potent inducer of Ig kappa light chain gene transcription in 70Z/3
pre-B cells, but the mechanism of this induction has not been elucidated. The
kappa intron enhancer contains a sequence closely resembling the IFN-stimulated
response element (ISRE). We have determined that the kappa intron enhancer is
IFN-gamma inducible in 70Z/3 cells and that the ISRE is required for this
induction. The kappa intron ISRE specifically bound IFN response factor-1 (IRF-1)
and the constitutively expressed IRF-2. This ISRE is a multifunctional motif that
also binds the LPS-inducible factor kappaBF-A and is located within the kappaBS
region, which confers B cell specific activity to this enhancer. However, since
the expression of IRF-1 is not restricted to B cells, it must not be sufficient
for the induction of kappa transcription. Furthermore, in the pre-B cell line
38B9, which is representative of an earlier stage in pre-B cell development than 
the 70Z/3 cell line, the kappa intron enhancer was not induced by IFN-gamma
despite the activation of IRF-1. These findings suggest that IFN-gamma activation
of kappa gene transcription during B cell maturation may be developmentally
controlled by elements that restrict the activity of the ISRE within the context 
of the intron enhancer.

Differentiation and growth arrest signals are generated through the cytoplasmic
region of gp130 that is essential for Stat3 activation.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces growth arrest and macrophage differentiation through
its receptor in a murine myeloid leukaemic cell line, M1, although it is largely 
unknown how the IL-6 receptor generates these signals. By using chimeric
receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of growth hormone receptor and
the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of gp130 with progressive C-terminal
truncations, we showed that the membrane-proximal 133, but not 108, amino acids
of gp130 could generate the signals for growth arrest, macrophage
differentiation, down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb, induction of junB and IRF1
and Stat3 activation. Mutational analysis of this region showed that the tyrosine
residue with the YXXQ motif was critical not only for Stat3 activation but also
for growth arrest and differentiation, accompanied by down-regulation of c-myc
and c-myb and immediate early induction of junB and IRF1. The tight correlation
between Stat3 activation and other IL-6 functions was further observed in the
context of the full-length cytoplasmic region of gp130. The result suggest that
Stat3 plays an essential role in the signals for growth arrest and
differentiation.

Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.

An upstream inverted repeat (IR) element mediates transcriptional activation of
the interferon response factor-1 gene (IRF-1) by interferon (IFN)-alpha and
IFN-gamma. IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma fail to induce IRF-1 in cells that lack signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and STAT1 homodimers bind to
IR elements in extracts of IFN-alpha-treated cells. We now report that STAT2 also
plays an important role in the IFN-alpha-mediated transcriptional activation of
the IRF-1 gene. A new factor, most likely a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer, was detected
with an IR probe in extracts of IFN-alpha-treated cells. STAT1 and STAT2 are
already known to combine with p48, a DNA-binding protein, to form IFN-stimulated 
gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs)
distinct from the IR of the IRF-1 gene. In extracts of U2A cells, which lack p48,
STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers were still formed, indicating that they do not contain
p48. We manipulated the intracellular levels of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers and
STAT1 homodimers to examine their roles in the induction of IRF-1 by IFN-alpha.
Although both dimers can induce IRF-1 transcription, the heterodimers are more
potent and thus may be the major activators in vivo. Deletion analysis reveals
that the C-terminal domain of STAT2 is important for transcriptional activation
mediated by both STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers and ISGF3.

Gutenberg University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany.

The genes crucially determining the therapeutic response of chronic myelogenous
leukaemia (CML) to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are unknown. Recently, two
independent IFN-alpha signalling pathways were identified: the classic pathway
mediates induction of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 OAS), p68 kinase and
IFN regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), whereas the alternate pathway leads to
activation of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We investigated whether deficient 
or imbalanced expression of components of these two pathways is associated with
resistance of CML cells to antiproliferative action of IFN alpha/beta.
Constitutive and IFN-induced transcript levels of IFN-dependent genes in
mononuclear cells, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and CD34+ cells of
chronic-phase CML and blast crisis patients were assessed by Northern blot
techniques and were correlated with subsequent clinical responses to IFN therapy.
Our results demonstrated that IFN-alpha or -beta treatment in vitro and in vivo
leads to an enhanced expression of IRF-1, IRF-2. RNase L, p68 and 2-5 OAS which
was independent of the degree of cellular differentiation and clonal evolution of
CML. Neither the magnitude of induction of these genes nor the IRF-1/IRF-2 mRNA
balance differed between chronic-phase CML patients responding or failing
IFN-alpha therapy. These results indicate that failure of IFN-alpha treatment is 
not due to defects in mRNA induction of the above-mentioned candidate genes for
the direct antiproliferative response to IFN type I.

Production of nitric oxide (NO) is not essential for protection against acute
Toxoplasma gondii infection in IRF-1-/- mice.

Khan IA(1), Matsuura T, Fonseka S, Kasper LH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.

Production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages is important for the killing of
intracellular pathogens. IFN-gamma and LPS stimulate NO production by
transcriptional up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS). In the
present study we used mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN regulatory
factor-1 gene (IRF-1-/-) to investigate the importance of NO in the host immune
response against Toxoplasma gondii, a major cause of infection in newborns and
those with AIDS. IRF-1-/- mice were more susceptible to acute Toxoplasma
infection, and treatment with either exogenous IFN-gamma or in vivo
neutralization of endogenous IFN-gamma had little effect on their susceptibility 
to infection. However, administration of exogenous IL-12 was able to prolong
survival even when IFN-gamma was depleted. An in vivo depletion study suggested
that the mechanism of this protective response is mediated in part by CD4+ T
cells. The administration of IL-12 could not overcome the inhibition of
lymphoproliferative response in T. gondii-infected mice and treatment with
N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) antagonist in
vitro was unable to reverse the immunosuppression. In response to Toxoplasma
infection, splenocytes from IRF-1-/- mice exhibited increased production of IL-10
as well as a 30-fold increase in its message expression. These studies indicate
that NO may not be essential for host immunity to the parasite, and moreover that
IL-12 appears to induce an IFN-gamma-independent mechanism of protection against 
this opportunistic pathogen.

Essential and non-redundant roles of p48 (ISGF3 gamma) and IRF-1 in both type I
and type II interferon responses, as revealed by gene targeting studies.

BACKGROUND: Interferons (IFNs) are a class of cytokines which confer cellular
resistance against viral infections. Type I (IFN-alpha and -beta) and type II
(IFN-gamma) IFNs utilize distinct receptors, the stimulation of which results in 
the induction of downstream target genes. These target genes usually contain
within their promoter region an IFN responsive element, termed ISRE (IFN
stimulated response element) which binds a heterotrimeric transcription factor,
ISGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) consisting of p48 (ISGF3 gamma), Stat1
(Signal transducers and activators of transcription-1; alpha or beta), and Stat2.
The ISRE sequence overlaps with that of IRF-E which binds another IFN-inducible
factor, IRF-1 (IFN regulatory factor-1).
RESULTS: We generated mice lacking p48 by gene targeting. We show that p48 plays 
an essential role in both type I and type II IFN responses; activation of
IFN-inducible genes and establishment of the antiviral state by IFN-alpha or
-gamma are both severely impaired, and ISRE-binding activities induced by both
IFNs are absent in the p48-negative embryonic fibroblasts (EFs). Furthermore, we 
generated mice deficient for both p48 and IRF-1 and found that at least one
IFN-inducible gene is dependent on both factors.
CONCLUSIONS: p48 and IRF-1 do not perform redundant functions in the cell, but
rather complement one another in both type I and II IFN responses.

Poor induction of interferon-induced 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5AS)
activity has been demonstrated in cells persistently infected with the mumps
virus or human T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I). The suppression of 2-5AS
induction is the result of the repression of 2-5AS gene expression at the
transcription level. In a general way, after the binding of interferon-alpha
(IFN-alpha) to cell surface-specific receptors, expression of 2-5AS gene is
thought to be regulated by some transacting factors, IFN-regulatory factors
(IRF-1 and IRF-2) and the IFN-stimulated gene factor (ISGF-3, a complex
consisting of STAT-1 alpha, STAT-2 and p48). To clarify the cause of the
suppression mechanism(s), fluctuation in the number of IFN receptors and the
levels of mRNAs in both IRF-1 and IRF-2 were examined in cells persistently
infected with the mumps virus (FLMT and KBMT). There were few differences in the 
number of IFN receptors and the level of IRF-2 mRNA between persistently infected
cells and uninfected control cells. After the treatment of cells with IFN, a
slight reduction of IRF-1 mRNA was found in persistently infected cells as
compared with that of the uninfected control cells.

Identification of a member of the interferon regulatory factor family that binds 
to the interferon-stimulated response element and activates expression of
interferon-induced genes.

Author information: 
(1)Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.

A family of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) have been shown to play a 
role in transcription of IFN genes as well as IFN-stimulated genes. We report the
identification of a member of the IRF family which we have named IRF-3. The IRF-3
gene is present in a single copy in human genomic DNA. It is expressed
constitutively in a variety of tissues and no increase in the relative
steady-state levels of IRF-3 mRNA was observed in virus-infected or IFN-treated
cells. The IRF-3 gene encodes a 50-kDa protein that binds specifically to the
IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) but not to the IRF-1 binding site PRD-I.
Overexpression of IRF-3 stimulates expression of the IFN-stimulated gene 15
(ISG15) promoter, an ISRE-containing promoter. The murine IFNA4 promoter, which
can be induced by IRF-1 or viral infection, is not induced by IRF-3. Expression
of IRF-3 as a Gal4 fusion protein does not activate expression of a
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene containing repeats of the Gal4
binding sites, indicating that this protein does not contain the transcription
transactivation domain. The high amino acid homology between IRF-3 and ISG factor
3 gamma polypeptide (ISGF3 gamma) and their similar binding properties indicate
that, like ISGF3 gamma, IRF-3 may activate transcription by complex formation
with other transcriptional factors, possibly members of the Stat family.
Identification of this ISRE-binding protein may help us to understand the
specificity in the various Stat pathways.

Major histocompatibility (MHC) class I gene expression is synergistically induced
by the cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. However, the mechanism that results in 
synergistic activation of these genes has remained unclear. We demonstrated here 
that TNF-alpha induced binding of NF kappa B p50 and p65 to the NF kappa B-like
element of the MHC class I promoter termed region I and IFN-gamma induced binding
of IRF-1 to the adjacent interferon consensus sequence (ICS). We further
demonstrated that NF kappa B and IRF-1 physically interacted with each other and 
cooperatively induced MHC class I gene expression when cotransfected into CHP-126
neuroblastomas. These results provide a molecular mechanism by which TNF-alpha
and IFN-gamma synergistically induce the expression of a variety of genes
involved in immune responses, including MHC class I.

Triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis

We investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of human
interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene in THP-1 monocytic cells, and compared it with the
basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Functional studies with IL-6
promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the IFN-gamma and/or 
TNF-alpha action, whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in
LPS activation. The three regions concerned are: 1) a region between -73 and -36,
which is the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-alpha; 2) an element located
between -181 and -73, which appeared to regulate the response to IFN-gamma and
TNF-alpha negatively; and 3) a distal element upstream of -224, which was
inducible by IFN-gamma alone. LPS signaling was found to involve NF kappa B
activation by the p50/p65 heterodimers. Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, in monocytic cells, involved cooperation between the
IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative
effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter. This
removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor, whose increased
binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-gamma.

Biologic responses to cytokines are mediated by intracellular pathways involving 
induction of signaling and metabolic cascades. Interferon (IFN) regulatory
factor-1 (IRF-1) is a major transcription factor induced not only by IFN-gamma
but also by other cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
Possible IRF-1 binding sequence elements have been located in the promoter
regions of several genes, including p53, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and
cyclin D1. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha can inhibit hematopoiesis in vitro and have
been implicated in the pathophysiology of bone marrow (BM) failure. We
investigated whether the inhibitory effects of these cytokines were
intracellularly mediated through the expression of IRF-1 or -2 in target cells.
In total BM cells, IRF-1 mRNA expression increased after stimulation with
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha; the stronger effect was observed with IFN-gamma. In
contrast, IRF-2 mRNA expression was constitutive and not altered by cytokine
stimulation. By gene amplification, low levels of IRF-1 mRNA were present in
unstimulated, highly purified CD34+ cells; on exposure to IFN-gamma and
TNF-alpha, amplified IRF-1 mRNA showed a much stronger signal than control. When 
CD34+ cells were treated with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, IRF-1 antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) partially reversed the suppressive effects on CD34+
cell-derived colony formation by IFN-gamma but not those by TNF-alpha. In
parallel experiments, IRF-1 antisense ODN decreased both IRF-1 protein and mRNA
expression. The effects of ODN were sequence-specific and
concentration-dependent. These results suggest that the inhibitory hematopoietic 
effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are mediated by different pathways. For
IFN-gamma, IRF-1 is involved in the activation of cellular genes responsible for 
IFN-gamma suppressive effects.

Nitric oxide produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase in islets exerts
inhibitory and cytotoxic effects on pancreatic beta cells and is therefore
thought to be a potent mediator in the pathogenesis of Type I diabetes mellitus. 
Here, using isolated rat pancreatic islets, we show that high-concentration
nicotinamide (20 mM), but not low-concentration nicotinamide (5 mM), attenuates
the interleukin-1 beta-evoked inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion by 
preventing the induction of interferon regulatory factor-1, a transcriptional
factor which plays an essential role in inducible nitric oxide synthase gene
expression, and the interleukin-1 beta-induced nitric oxide formation.
High-concentration nicotinamide also restored an interleukin-1 beta-induced
decrease in ATP content in pancreatic beta cells, suggesting that interleukin-1
beta-induced nitric oxide inhibits the mitochondrial function. The present
results show the molecular basis of the preventive effect of high-dose
nicotinamide on Type I diabetes mellitus.

IRF-1 and IRF-2 as regulators of the interferon system and cell growth.

(1)Department of Immunology, University of Tokyo, Japan.

Interferons (IFNs) are families of cytokines which have been discovered and
extensively characterized in the context of host defense against viral
infections. We have discovered two structurally related transcription factors,
Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2. These two factors, however,
function not only as regulators of the IFN system, but are also key transcription
factors in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. These studies uncover a
complex gene transcription network, by which the fate of cellular responses are
determined depending on how the IRF transcription factors function in conjunction
with other factors, and on the promoters of distinct genes under different
conditions of the cells.

The human histone H4 gene FO108 is regulated during the cell cycle with a peak in
transcription during early S phase. The cell-cycle element (CCE) required for H4 
histone activation is a sequence of 11 base pairs that binds a protein factor in 
electrophoretic mobility shift assays that has been designated histone nuclear
factor M (HiNF-M). Here we report the purification of HiNF-M, and show it to be a
protein of relative molecular mass (M(r)) 48K that is identical to interferon
(IFN) regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2), a negative transcriptional regulator of the
IFN response. Recombinant IRF-2 (as well as the related protein IRF-1 (ref. 5))
binds the CCE specifically and activates transcription of this H4 histone gene.
IRF-2 has been shown to have oncogenic potential, and our results demonstrate a
link between IRF-2 and a gene that is functionally coupled to DNA replication and
cell-cycle progression at the G1/S phase transition.

5' upstream sequences of MyD88, an IL-6 primary response gene in M1 cells:

Transcription regulatory elements have been analyzed in upstream sequences of an 
Interleukin-6 (Il-6) primary response gene, MyD88. MyD88 2.3 kb mRNA is strongly 
and persistently induced in the course of myeloleukemic M1 cells differentiation 
with Il-6. MyD88 cDNA sequences were found in a region of 12 kb of mouse genomic 
DNA. Using Il-6 treated M1 cell RNAs, two transcription start sites have been
localized, approximately 100 bp upstream from the 5' end of the cloned cDNA. We
sequenced 1.4 kb of 5' genomic DNA including the first exon. In 5' of mRNA
transcription start site, MyD88 nucleotidic sequence is 85% identical to 5'
complementary sequences of the rat 3'-ketoacetyl CoA thiolase gene, over 1.2 kb. 
A DNA element conferring Il-6-inducible transcription to reporter genes, and
localized 30 bp upstream of MyD88 first RNA start site, contains overlapping
binding sites for cytokine activated transcription factors Stat and for the
Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 and -2 (IRF-1 and IRF-2). In vitro binding assays 
showed that attachment of Stat factors to this element early in Il-6 treatment
requires tyrosine kinase activation. IRF1, an activator of transcription, is also
induced to bind to this sequence at later times. A model of persistent activation
of MyD88 gene through these two types of factors is proposed.

The role of the MHC-IRF-E and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in the
regulation of MHC class I genes in astrocytes was analyzed. Transcriptional
activation of MHC class I genes after treatment of astrocytes with various
inducers occurred over a period of hours and correlated with cell surface
expression. Functional analysis of the MHC class I gene promoter region confirmed
that induction was controlled by a restricted region of 88 base pairs containing 
two well-defined inducible enhancers, the MHC-CRE and the MHC-IRF-E. Further
analysis showed that potential MHC-CRE enhancer activity was silent. Therefore,
the MHC-IRF-E, rather than the MHC-CRE, appeared responsible for enhancement of
the MHC class I gene and was supported by three findings: (1) site-directed
mutation of the MHC-IRF-E-abrogated induction, (2) promoter constructs containing
IRF-Es as the sole enhancers were highly inducible in astrocytes, and (3) the
expression of transcription factor IRF-1, which acts through the MHC-IRF-E to
induce MHC class I genes, was induced to high levels in parallel with that of MHC
class I induction. The induction of the IRF-1 gene correlated with the prior
induction of the gamma-activated factor (GAF) or NF-kappa B, depending on the
inducer, indicating that both gamma activation sites (GAS) and kappa B sites in
the IRF-1 promoter are important.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The growth-dependent expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor is regulated by
transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-1 and -2.

Angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor is abundantly and widely expressed in fetal 
tissues but present only in restricted tissues in the adult such as brain and
atretic ovary. This receptor is speculated to be involved in tissue growth and/or
differentiation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of growth-regulated AT2
receptor expression, we cloned the mouse AT2 receptor genomic DNA and studied its
promoter function in mouse fibroblast-derived R3T3 cells, which express AT2
receptor in the confluent, quiescent state but very low levels of the receptor in
actively growing state. Promoter/luciferase reporter deletion analysis of AT2
receptor in R3T3 cells showed that the putative negative regulatory region is
located between the positions -453 and -225, which plays an important role in the
transcriptional control of AT2 receptor gene expression along with the cell
growth. We identified the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding motif in
this region using DNase foot-printing analysis and demonstrated that IRF binding 
oligonucleotide treatment increased the AT2 receptor expression in growing R3T3
cells but not in confluent cells. Furthermore, by antisense treatment, we
demonstrated that IRF-2 attenuated the AT2 receptor expression in both growing
and confluent R3T3 cells, whereas IRF-1 enhanced AT2 receptor expression in the
confluent cells only. Consistent with this result, gel mobility shift assay
demonstrated that growing R3T3 cells exhibited only IRF-2 binding, whereas
confluent cells exhibited both IRF-1 and IRF-2 binding. Furthermore, we observed 
using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that the IRF-1 mRNA
expression was more abundant in confluent cells than growing cells, whereas IRF-2
expression did not change with R3T3 cell growth. We conclude that, in confluent
cells, the enhanced expression of IRF-1 antagonizes the IRF-2 effect and
increases the AT2 receptor expression. We speculate that these transcriptional
factors influence cell growth in part by regulating AT2 receptor expression.

An IRF-1-dependent pathway of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in mitogen-activated T
lymphocytes.

Lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, a
response which may serve as a form of 'altruistic suicide' to counter their
intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion. The tumour suppressor
p53 has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in thymocytes, but an as
yet unknown, p53-independent pathway(s) appears to mediate the same event in
mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes. Here we show DNA damage-induced apoptosis
in these T lymphocytes is dependent on the antioncogenic transcription factor
interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1. Thus two different anti-onco-genic
transcription factors, p53 and IRF-1, are required for distinct apoptotic
pathways in T lymphocytes. We also show that mitogen induction of the
interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) gene, a mammalian homologue of the
Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, is IRF-1-dependent. Ectopic
overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ICE 
and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis.

Transcription factor IRF-2 exerts its oncogenic phenotype through the DNA
binding/transcription repression domain.

Hospital, Montreal, Quebec.

The Interferon Regulatory Factors-1 and -2 (IRF-1 and IRF-2) play a
transcriptional role in the regulation of the IFN-beta gene as well as other
immunoregulatory genes. IRF-1 serves as a transcriptional activator whereas IRF-2
acts as an antagonistic transcriptional repressor. IRF-1 and IRF-2 also play
opposing functional roles in cell growth regulation, and are implicated as a
potential antioncogene and oncogene, respectively. To analyse the relationship
between DNA binding/transcriptional repression and oncogenic transformation,
NIH3T3 cells expressing C-terminal deletions of IRF-2 were established and
assayed for transformation by saturation density analysis, anchorage independent 
growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Cells expressing an IRF-2
protein of at least 160 N-terminal amino acids were transformed in vitro and
tumorigenic in vivo, thus mapping IRF-2 oncogenic activity to its DNA
binding/transcriptional repression domain. Overexpression of wild-type and
truncated IRF-2 proteins resulted in reduced IFN-beta mRNA levels following
induction by dsRNA. However, there was no effect of IRF-2 on IFN-beta
inducibility by Sendai virus infection, suggesting the involvement of multiple
IFN-beta induction pathways. In DNA binding assays, recombinant IRF-2 was found
to preferentially bind to the IFN-beta PRDI site compared to IRF-1. These studies
indicate that the transformed phenotype resulting from overexpression of IRF-2
may be due to constitutive engagement of the IRF-E recognition site, thus
preventing DNA binding and transactivation of putative tumor suppressor genes by 
the IRF-1 anti-oncogene.

IRF-1 induced cell growth inhibition and interferon induction requires the
activity of the protein kinase PKR.

(1)GBF--Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung mbH, Braunschweig, Germany.

Expression of the tumor suppressor IRF-1 results in the inhibition of cell growth
and transcriptional activation of the IFN-beta gene. IFN production is not
responsible for the IRF-1 mediated cell growth inhibition. It is shown here that 
activation of the IRF-1 causes induction of PKR expression. PKR is a
serine/threonine kinase with tumor suppressor activity. IRF-1 mediated cell
growth inhibition and IFN induction correlates with PKR expression. A
catalytically inactive dominant negative PKR mutant abolishes both activities of 
IRF-1. These data demonstrate that the tumor suppressor activity of IRF-1 is
mediated, at least in part, by PKR.

The mechanism responsible for the induction of the 2-5A synthetase gene by
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (type II) was studied in Friend leukemia cells. It
was previously shown that activation of 2-5A synthetase gene expression by
IFN-gamma in the 3Cl8 cell, a clone resistant to IFN-alpha,beta (type I),
correlates with the formation of two major complexes, designated Fg and Fc, that 
bind to the interferon-stimulated responsive element of the gene. Conversely, in 
a clone resistant to both types of IFNs (3 gamma R8), no induction of DNA-protein
complexes or of 2-5A synthetase gene expression was detected. In the present
report the Fg complex has been characterized as including the interferon
regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), whereas the Fc factor, present also in control
cells, has been characterized as composed of IRF-2. Incubation of cell extracts
with antibodies to IRF-1 abolishes the formation of the Fg complex, and
antibodies to IRF-2 abolish the formation of the Fc complex. Moreover, in the
3Cl8 cell, IFN-gamma is able to induce in few minutes the formation of a complex 
between a DNA element identified as the IFN-gamma activation site (GAS), present 
on the IRF-1 gene promoter, and the STAT1 protein. These findings suggest that in
cells resistant to type I IFN, IFN-gamma is able, through the activation of the
STAT1 protein, to induce the expression of the IRF-1 factor which in turn seems
to be sufficient to transactivate the 2-5A synthetase gene.

The in vivo and in vitro antitumor effectiveness of IFNs is well documented.
Their combination with differentiating agents, such as retinoic acid, has been
demonstrated to be a promising therapy for patients with advanced squamous cell
cancer of the skin and the cervix. However, the mechanisms that mediate these
antitumor responses are not yet known. We studied the epidermoid cell line ME 180
derived from human cervical carcinoma to test its responsiveness to IFN-alpha-2b 
(INTRON A) and all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). Both agents have demonstrated
ability to inhibit the growth of ME 180 cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. The antiproliferative effect was further increased by the treatment with 
IFN-alpha-2b and RA combined. In accordance with this result, we found that the
combination of the two agents has the effect of increasing the expression of the 
2-5A synthetase gene, which is thought to play a key role in antigrowth responses
to IFNs. At increased levels of 2-5A synthetase mRNA corresponds a significant
increase in 2-5A synthetase activity. Although RA per se has no effect on the
2-5A synthetase expression, when it is combined with IFN-alpha-2b it appears to
be able to potentiate the IFN-induced 2-5A synthetase expression. Moreover, the
combination of IFN-alpha-2b and RA produces a similar effect also on the
expression of the HLA-A2 gene, which has been shown to be induced in ME 180 cells
both by IFN-alpha-2b and RA alone. In view of the possible mechanisms of action
of the two agents, it is interesting to note that their combination increases,
although transiently, the expression of IRF1, which codes for a transcription
factor that regulates IFN gene expression and is thought to be involved in the
regulation of IFN-induced effects and in mediating cell death or apoptosis.

The ability of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to inhibit the proliferation of type 
2 T helper cells (TH2), but not that of type 1 (TH1) cells, suggests that helper 
cell subsets might differ in their activation of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway.
The IFN-gamma-inducible signal transducing factor (STF-IFN gamma) was activated
in murine TH2 but not in TH1 cell clones, because in the latter the second chain 
of the IFN-gamma receptor (accessory factor 1 or IFN-gamma R beta) was absent.
Thus, TH1 cells use receptor modification to prevent the activation of STF-IFN
gamma and achieve an IFN-gamma-resistant state.

Cytokine regulation of the liver transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-3
beta is mediated by the C/EBP family and interferon regulatory factor 1.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Illinois at Chicago 60612-7334, USA.

Three distinct hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3) proteins (alpha, beta, and
gamma) regulate the transcription of numerous liver-enriched genes. The HNF-3
proteins bind DNA via a homologous winged helix motif common to a number of
proteins known to be critical for determination events in embryogenesis. We have 
demonstrated previously that two binding sites in the -184 HNF-3 beta promoter
are recognized by widely distributed factors and that there is also a critical
autoregulatory site, we identified a binding site for a cell-specific factor,
LF-H3 beta, that may function in restricting HNF-3 beta gene expression to
hepatocytes. Our present study demonstrates that members of the C/EBP and proline
and acidic amino acid-rich subfamilies of basic region leucine zipper
transcription factors bind the LF-H3 beta site, and cotransfection of HepG2 cells
shows that these factors are able to activate an HNF-3 beta promoter reporter
construct. The LF-H3 beta-C/EBP binding sequence also confers HNF-3 beta promoter
stimulation in response to interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6. Upstream of this HNF-3
beta proximal promoter region, an IFN-stimulated response element core sequence
(-231 to -210) was found that mediates transcriptional induction by IFN-gamma but
not IFN-alpha. Gel mobility supershift assay demonstrates that an
IFN-gamma-induced protein-DNA complex is disrupted by an antibody specific for
interferon regulatory factor-1/interferon-stimulated gene factor-2. Consistent
with this finding, we observed that IFN-gamma induction requires ongoing protein 
synthesis. Surprisingly, the effect of the three cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and
IFN-gamma) in combination as assayed by the same model is not synergistic.
HNF-3beta joins the C/EBP family on the list of liver-enriched transcription
factors, the expression of which is modulated by cytokines.

Vesicular stomatitis virus infection induces a nuclear DNA-binding factor

and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has a broad host range. It replicates in the
cytoplasm and causes rapid cytopathic effects. We show that following VSV
infection, a nuclear factor that binds to a select set of interferon-stimulated
responsive elements (ISRE) is induced in many cell types. This factor,
tentatively called VSV-induced binding protein (VIBP), was estimated to have an
approximate molecular mass of 50 kDa and was distinct from known members of the
interferon regulatory factor family, that are known to bind to the ISRE.
Induction of VIBP required tyrosine kinase activity but did not require cellular 
transcription. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide, which inhibits translation,
only partially inhibited induction of VIBP. However, type I interferons and
staurosporine, both of which inhibit VSV transcription, inhibited VIBP induction.
Moreover, a double-stranded RNA analog, poly(I)-poly(C) also induced a
DNA-binding activity very similar to that of VIBP. These results indicate that a 
preexisting cellular protein is activated upon VSV infection and that this
activation requires primary viral transcripts. The functional activity of VIBP
was analyzed in cells stably transfected with a herpesvirus thymidine
kinase-luciferase reporter gene that is under control of the ISRE. While activity
of the control promoter without ISRE was strongly inhibited following VSV
infection (as a result of virus-mediated transcriptional shutdown of the host
cell), the inhibition was reversed by the ISRE-containing promoter, albeit
partially, which suggests that VSV infection differentially affects transcription
of host genes. Although VIBP was induced in all other cells tested, it was not
induced in embryonal carcinoma cells after VSV infection, suggesting
developmental regulation of VIBP inducibility.

Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a newly cloned cytokine which is the major regulator of
circulating platelet levels, acting on both proliferation and differentiation of 
megakaryocytes. We have investigated the ability of TPO to activate the JAK/STAT 
pathway in megakaryocytic cell lines. We used either the granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and/or erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent UT7
cell line in which the murine TPO receptor (mumpl) had been transfected
(mumpl-UT7 transfectants) or the MO7E and DAMI cells which express endogenous
human TPO receptors. We demonstrated that TPO activates the kinase JAK2 and a
STAT5-like transcriptional factor but not STAT1, STAT2, STAT3 or STAT4, in a very
rapid and transient manner. In order to better ascertain the specificity of the
activation of STAT5-related factor by TPO, we investigated the effect of other
cytokines/growth factors. Both GM-CSF and EPO activated the STAT5-like factor. In
contrast, neither interferon (IFN)-gamma nor the mitogenic stem cell factor (SCF)
activated STAT5, although IFN-gamma did activate STAT1 in those cells. The
hematopoietic DNA binding activity related to STAT5 was identified as a p97
tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band which exhibited identical gel mobility to
the mammary STAT5. Because v-mpl, a truncated form of the TPO receptor c-mpl, was
shown to be oncogenic, we tested the activity of v-mpl on STAT5 and found STAT5
constitutively activated in two different v-mpl-expressing cells, the transiently
transfected Cos7 cells and the stable v-mpl-UT7 transfectants. Overall, our data 
indicate that STAT5 is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells and activated by a
number of cytokines, including TPO, GM-CSF and EPO, but not by IFN-gamma or SCF.

Functional domain analysis of interferon consensus sequence binding protein
(ICSBP) and its association with interferon regulatory factors.

Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a member of the
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of proteins that include IRF-1, IRF-2, 
and ISGF3gamma which share sequence similarity at the putative DNA binding domain
(DBD). ICSBP is expressed exclusively in cells of the immune system and acts as a
repressor of interferon consensus sequence (ICS) containing promoters that can be
alleviated by interferons. In this communication, we have searched for functional
domains of ICSBP by dissecting the DBD from the repression activity. The putative
DBD of ICSBP (amino acids 1-121) when fused in frame to the transcriptional
activation domain of the herpes simplex VP16 (ICSBP-VP16) is a very strong
activator of ICS-containing promoters. In addition, ICSBP-VP16 fusion construct
transfected into adenovirus (Ad) 12 transformed cells enabled cell surface
expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens as did treatment 
with interferon. On the other hand, the DBD of the yeast transcriptional
activator GAL4 was fused in frame to a truncated ICSBP in which the DBD was
impaired resulting in a chimeric construct GAL4-ICSBP. This construct is capable 
of repressing promoters containing GAL4 binding sites. Thus, ICSBP contains at
least two independent domains: a DBD and a transcriptional repressor domain.
Furthermore, we have tested possible interactions between ICSBP and IRFs. The
chimeric construct GAL4-ICSBP inhibited the stimulated effect of IRF-1 on a
reporter gene, implying for a possible interaction between IRF-1 and ICSBP.
Electromobility shift assays, demonstrated that ICSBP can associate with IRF-2 or
IRF-1 in vitro as well as in vivo. Thus, ICSBP contains a third functional domain
that enables the association with IRFs. These associations are probably important
for the fine balance between positive and negative regulators involved in the
interferon-mediated signal transduction pathways in cells of the immune system.

A common mutation in the hominoid class I A-locus IFN-responsive element results 
in the loss of enhancer activity.

Vallejo AN(1), Allen KS, Pease LR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic/Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Despite the observed coordinate expression of HLA-A and -B antigens in somatic
tissues, there is growing evidence that the A and B class I genes are
differentially regulated at the transcriptional level. Previous studies indicate 
that this may be related to locus-specific structural differences in certain
enhancer elements. We have recently examined the 5' proximal regulatory regions
of the A and B homologs in the higher non-human primates and found pronounced
differences between the loci. Sequence analysis shows the B-promoters are more
homogeneous, whereas the A-locus promoters are divergent among the various
species examined. The differences in A- and B-promoters is exemplified by the
regulatory element referred to as the IFN-responsive element (IRE). While the
B-locus IRE is conserved among all primates examined, the A-locus IRE are
divergent and reveal different sequences in the human/chimpanzee, gorilla and
orang-utan. In reporter gene bioassays, the B-locus IRE exhibited an enhancer
activity in response to induction with IFN-beta and IFN-gamma. In contrast, all
the variants of the A-locus IRE found in hominoid primates were unresponsive to
IFN. One base substitution shared by all the primate IREs proved to be
inactivating. These results provide a molecular basis of how duplicated gene loci
encoding structurally and functionally similar antigen-presenting molecules may
become differentially responsive to physiological stimulus.

Endothelial interferon regulatory factor 1 cooperates with NF-kappa B as a
transcriptional activator of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.

(1)Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts
02115, USA.

Transcription of the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) gene in
endothelial cells is induced by lipopolysaccharide and the inflammatory cytokines
interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Previous studies 
have demonstrated that tandem binding sites for the inducible transcription
factor NF-kappa B are necessary but not sufficient for full cytokine-mediated
transcriptional activation. Herein, we demonstrate that full cytokine-induced
accumulation of VCAM1 transcript requires protein synthesis. We report the
definition of a functional regulatory element in the VCAM1 promoter interacting
with the transcriptional activator interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1).
DNA-protein binding studies with endothelial nuclear extracts revealed that IRF-1
is cytokine inducible and binds specifically to a consensus sequence motif
located 3' of the TATA element. We have identified heterodimeric p65 and p50 as
the NF-kappa B species binding to the VCAM1 promoter in TNF-alpha-activated
endothelial cells. Experiments with recombinant proteins showed that p50/p65 and 
high-mobility-group I(Y) protein cooperatively facilitated the binding of IRF-1
to the VCAM1 IRF binding site and that IRF-1 physically interacted with p50 and
with high-mobility-group I(Y) protein. Transient transfection assay in
endothelial cells showed that overexpressed IRF-1 resulted in superinduction of
TNF-alpha-stimulated transcription. Site-directed mutations in the IRF binding
element decreased TNF-alpha-induced activity and totally abolished
superinduction. Cotransfection assays in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells revealed
that IRF-1 synergized with p50/p65 NF-kappa B to activate the VCAM1 promoter or
heterologous promoter constructs bearing isolated VCAM1 NF-kappa B and IRF
binding motifs. Cytokine inducibility of VCAM1 in endothelial cells utilizes the 
interaction of heterodimeric p50/p65 proteins with IRF-1.

A major role for the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 in the JAK/STAT signal
transduction pathway in response to interleukin-6.

The protein tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 and STATs (signal transducers
and activators of transcription) 1 and 3 are activated in response to
interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human fibrosarcoma cells. In mutant cells lacking JAK1,
JAK2 or Tyk2, the absence of one kinase does not prevent activation of the
others; activation does not, therefore, involve a sequential three-kinase
cascade. In the absence of JAK1, the phosphorylation of the gp130 subunit of the 
IL-6 receptor and the activation of STATs 1 and 3 are greatly reduced. JAK1 is
also necessary for the induction of IRF1 mRNA, thus establishing a requirement
for the JAK/STAT pathway in the IL-6 response. JAK2 and Tyk2 although activated
cannot, in the absence of JAK1, efficiently mediate activation of STATs 1 and 3. 
A kinase-negative mutant of JAK2 can, however, inhibit such activation, and
ancillary roles for JAK2 and Tyk2 are not excluded. A major role for JAK1 and the
nonequivalence of JAK1 and JAK2 in the IL-6 response pathway are, nevertheless,
clearly established for these cells.

Biphasic transcriptional regulation of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene by

proteins.

Stimulation of quiescent Nb2 T cells by PRL leads to the rapid transcriptional
activation of a T cell activation gene, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1).
IRF-1 is induced twice by PRL in a single cell cycle, first during G1 at 30-60
min and again over early S phase at 10-12 h. By nuclear run-on transcription
analysis of IRF-1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs,
the -1.7 kilobase (kb) 5'-flanking IRF-1 DNA was shown to contain elements that
mediate both G1 and S phase expression. The -200 bp IRF-1 promoter DNA contains
elements that respond to G1 PRL stimulation in a protein synthesis independent
manner, suggesting the involvement of pre-existing factors. Further promoter
deletion analysis delineated a minimal PRL responsive region between -112 and
-205 bp. Within this region is a Gamma Interferon Activated Sequence or GAS,
consisting of two inverted GAAA motifs (-123/-113), which confers PRL-inducible
expression to a reporter gene, suggesting that GAS can function as a PRL
responsive element. Further, GAS exhibits binding with nuclear proteins in a
PRL-inducible, cell cycle-dependent manner. One of these proteins appears to be
related to the emerging family of Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription or Stat factors. These studies suggest that the GAS site and
Stat-like proteins participate in PRL receptor signal transduction to regulate
the biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene in PRL-stimulated T cells.

Activation of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, MxA, and IFN regulatory factor 1 genes in
influenza A virus-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Mononuclear blood cells have an important role in immunity as they produce
different cytokines in response to microbial infections. We infected primary
human mononuclear blood cells with a pathogenic influenza A virus
(A/Beijing/353/89) and studied the activation of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IRF-1, and
MxA genes. IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma steady state mRNA levels peaked at 6 to 9 h
after infection and declined rapidly thereafter. Only a modest (twofold) increase
in IRF-1 mRNA was seen. MxA gene expression, normally strictly regulated by
IFN-alpha/beta, had expression kinetics similar to those of IFN mRNA. Infection
experiments done in the presence of cycloheximide showed that influenza virus
infection could induce all genes studied in the absence of detectable protein
synthesis. Pretreatment with IFN-alpha, but not with IFN-gamma, caused a
dose-dependent inhibition of influenza virus replication in PBMC, and this
inhibition correlated with increasing levels of MxA protein. Influenza virus
replication was also inhibited in a stably transfected, MxA-expressing
promonocytic U937 cell line. The results suggest that MxA protein significantly
contributes to IFN-mediated host defence mechanisms against influenza A virus.

phenotypes.

Japan.

We established interferon-gamma-resistant (IGR) cells from a human colon
adenocarcinoma cell line, LoVo. Their resistance was extremely high, and the ED50
values of IFN-gamma were > 10(5) IU/ml. Interestingly, although IGR-5 cells were 
still sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha, the cells lost
responsiveness to the antiviral effects of both IFN-alpha and gamma. Another
clone, IGR-53, was unresponsive to both the antiproliferative and antiviral
effects of either IFN-alpha or gamma. Furthermore, the IFN-gamma-resistant
phenotypes of IGR cells were apparently dominant to the parental LoVo cells based
on complementation tests. Although IGR-53 cells lack IFN-gamma receptors, IGR-5
cells seemed to have functional IFN-gamma receptors and processing mechanisms of 
IFN-gamma bound to the receptors. Northern analysis showed that IGR-5 cells
responded to IFN-gamma and alpha, but the enhancement of IRF-1 expression by
IFN-gamma was markedly suppressed.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 is required for mouse Gbp gene activation by gamma
interferon.

Full-scale transcriptional activation of the mouse Gbp genes by gamma interferon 
(IFN-gamma) requires protein synthesis in embryonic fibroblasts. Although the
Gbp-1 and Gbp-2 promoters contain binding sites for transcription factors Stat1
and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), deletion analysis revealed that the Stat1
binding site is dispensable for IFN-gamma inducibility of Gbp promoter constructs
in transfected fibroblasts. However, activation of the mouse Gbp promoter by
IFN-gamma requires transcription factor IRF-1. Transient overexpression of IRF-1 
cDNA in mouse fibroblasts resulted in high-level expression of Gbp promoter
constructs. Unlike wild-type cells, IRF-1% embryonic stem cells lacking
functional transcription factor IRF-1 contained very low levels of Gbp
transcripts that were not increased in response to differentiation or treatment
with IFN-gamma. Treatment of IRF-1% mice with IFN-gamma resulted in barely
detectable levels of Gbp RNA in spleens, lungs, and livers, whereas such
treatment induced high levels of Gbp RNA in the organs of wild-type mice. These
observations suggest two alternative pathways for transcriptional induction of
genes in response to IFN-gamma: immediate response that results from activation
of preformed Stat1 and delayed response that results from induced de novo
synthesis of transcription factor IRF-1.

Differential expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), IRF-2, and
interferon consensus sequence binding protein genes in lipopolysaccharide

Macrophages secrete interferon (IFN), as well as other cytokines, following
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)
comprise a family of DNA-binding proteins that have been implicated in the
transcriptional regulation of IFN and certain IFN-inducible genes. We therefore
characterized basal and LPS-inducible levels of IRF-1, IRF-2, and interferon
consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) mRNA in LPS-responsive macrophages and
compared the expression of these genes in macrophages that typify two murine
models of LPS hyporesponsiveness. In the first model, the LPS-hyporesponsive
phenotype of the C3H/HeJ mouse is genetically determined and maps to the Lps
locus on mouse chromosome 4. In the second model, normally LPS-responsive
macrophages acquire a transient LPS-hyporesponsive phenotype following a prior
exposure to LPS, a phenomenon referred to as "endotoxin tolerance." Using reverse
transcription PCR, we detected basal levels of IRF-1 mRNA in LPS-responsive
(Lpsn) macrophages that were approximately 15 times higher than those found in
LPS-hyporesponsive (Lpsd) macrophages. Conversely, Lpsd macrophages expressed
basal levels of IRF-2 mRNA that were approximately 18 times higher than those
expressed in Lpsn macrophages. LPS stimulation resulted in a dose- and
time-dependent accumulation of IRF-1, IRF-2, and ICSBP mRNA only in Lpsn
macrophages. Cycloheximide inhibited the accumulation of LPS-stimulated IRF-2 and
ICSBP mRNA, but not IRF-1 mRNA, thus designating IRF-1 an immediate-early,
LPS-inducible gene. Finally, macrophages rendered tolerant to endotoxin expressed
elevated but nonmaximal mRNA levels for all three transcription factors that are 
not reinduced upon secondary challenge with LPS. Thus, the IRFs may represent yet
an additional molecular pathway in the complex response to LPS.

Analysis of gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes is of special
interest because it could reflect physiological conditions. We have examined the 
expression and compared the relative amounts of specific mRNAs for interferons
(IFN-alpha and IFN-beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon 
regulatory factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2) from interferon primed and Sendai virus
induced peripheral blood leukocytes. Results obtained showed that IRF-1 was
highly inducible by IFN treatment, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha and IRF-2 were weakly
induced by IFN treatment, and IFN-beta was not inducible by priming the cells
with recombinant human IFN-alpha 2b. The IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IRF-2 and TNF-alpha
transcripts increased upon viral infection. The IRF-1 mRNA was rapidly induced by
IFN treatment and decreased after Sendai virus infection. Our results show that, 
in peripheral blood lymphocytes, IFN-alpha and -beta genes have a different
response to IFN induction, thus suggesting different regulatory mechanisms for
IFN induction of type I IFN genes in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

Conserved high-affinity NF-kappa B binding site in the interferon regulatory
factor-1 promoter is not occupied by NF-kappa B in vivo and is transcriptionally 
inactive.

The promoter of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene contains at
position -47 to -38 an evolutionary conserved binding sequence for the inducible 
transcription factor NF-kappa B. This site is highly homologous to a
transcriptionally active site from the MHC class I enhancer. In this study, we
show by in vitro assays using purified NF-kappa B that the kappa B motif in the
IRF-1 promoter binds the factor specifically and with high affinity, comparable
to various other cis-acting kappa B elements. Two copies of the IRF-1 kappa B
site fused to the heterologous c-fos promoter conferred induction of a
chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reported gene in response to stimulation
of L929 fibroblasts with various NF-kappa B inducers, such as tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF alpha) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Mutation of
the binding site completely abolished transcriptional inducibility of the
heterologous promoter. Surprisingly, the same IRF-1 kappa B motif in context of
the homologous IRF-1 promoter was transcriptionally inactive in CAT assays. The
very weak induction of the IRF-1 promoter in response to TNF treatment or
infection of fibroblasts with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was barely affected
by point mutation of the kappa B site or loss of the site by truncation of the
promoter. Analysis of the occupational state of the chromosomal IRF-1 kappa B
site by in vivo foot-printing revealed that no footprint was induced over the
kappa B motif in the IRF-1 promoter after PMA treatment of L929 fibroblast cells,
despite the simultaneous induction of IRF-1 mRNA and NF-kappa B binding activity.
Constitutive footprints were detected at a CCAAT and GC-rich region in the
promoter. This is the first example of a high-affinity NF-kappa B binding site
within a promoter which may not participate in transcriptional regulation under
conditions activating NF-kappa B DNA binding and gene expression.

Regulation of the interferon system and cell growth by the IRF transcription
factors.

Induction of gene transcription in response to extracellular stimuli constitutes 
an essential aspect of host defense mechanisms. Interferons (IFN) are families of
cytokines that have been discovered and extensively characterized in the context 
of host defense against viral infections. In elucidating the mechanism of
transcriptional induction of the IFN genes by viruses, we have discovered two
structurally related transcription factors, Interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF-1) and IRF-2. These two factors, however, function not only as regulators of
the IFN system, but are also key transcription factors in the regulation of cell 
growth and apoptosis. Thus, these studies uncover a complex gene transcription
network in which the fate of cellular responses is determined by how the IRF
transcription factors function in conjunction with other factors on the promoters
of distinct genes under different conditions of the cells.

IDO mutants cross resistant to type I interferon retain p91-dependent gene
induction.

Klein SB(1), Yeivin A, Becker G, Taylor MW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington.

Genetic analyses of mutants have yielded valuable information about
p91-associated interferon signal transduction. It was thus discovered that p91 is
an essential protein for the induction of both type I and type II interferons. We
previously reported the development of ME180 mutants resistant to
interferon-gamma because of a signaling defect resulting in the loss of IDO
induction. IDO does not respond to type I interferon despite an ISRE-like
sequence upstream of the coding region. However, the IDO mutants were found to be
cross-resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of type I interferon. We
therefore examined the effects of both types of interferon on
interferon-stimulated gene mRNA accumulation and examined alterations in cellular
protein introduced by the mutation. The induction of the p91-responsive gene 6-16
was not altered in either of the mutants, and the early-induced gene IRF1
exhibited differences only in the kinetics of mRNA accumulation. The later
induced gene, p68, also exhibited different kinetics, possibly reflecting the
changes in IRF1. Immunoprecipitated p91 exhibited normal, interferon-induced
phosphorylation in both mutants. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed
that the mutant cells contained 20 peptides with altered biochemistry. These
results suggest that IDO induction is controlled by a distinct set of proteins
not directly correlated with p91 activation.

Two interferon (IFN) alpha-regulated genes, IRF1/ISGF2 and PKR/p68 kinase, may
function as tumor suppressor genes suggesting that the IFN system may function as
a tumor suppressor system. We report that the expression of the alpha subunit of 
the type I IFN receptor in human K-562 cells had anti-oncogenic effects that
include a marked decrease in: (i) cell proliferation rate, (ii) the cell density 
at which growth arrest normally occurs, and (iii) the tumorigenicity in nude
mice. Furthermore, expression of the alpha subunit in K-562 cells induced
erythroid differentiation. While most cytokine receptors become activated after
binding their corresponding ligands, the overexpression of the alpha subunit has 
a physiological effect in the absence of its natural ligand, type I IFNs,
suggesting a novel function for this type I IFN receptor subunit. The
anti-oncogenic effect of the alpha subunit is mediated by a pathway that does not
involve two tumor suppressor genes induced by type I IFNs, the transcriptional
regulator IFN response factor-1 and the RNA-dependent protein kinase, or the
p135tyk2 tyrosine kinase that directly associates and phosphorylates the alpha
subunit.

Accelerated exon skipping of IRF-1 mRNA in human myelodysplasia/leukemia; a
possible mechanism of tumor suppressor inactivation.

H, Taniguchi T.

The transcription factor IRF-1 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor. 
Here we report that a significant proportion of the IRF-1 mRNA detected in normal
human hematopoietic cells and cultured cell lines lacks exon 2 (containing the
AUG initiation codon) and 3 as a result of exon skipping. Surprisingly, when we
examined the bone marrow and peripheral mononuclear cells from patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia secondary to MDS, we could still
detect the exon-skipped form but little or none of the intact IRF-1 mRNA. This
appears to be the result of accelerated exon skipping since we could find no
mutations within the exons and splicing junctions from these patients. The
exon-skipped form of IRF-1 lacking exons 2 and 3 displayed neither DNA binding
nor tumor suppressive activities. Thus this accelerated exon skipping may cause
the inactivation of IRF-1 and thereby contribute to the development of human
hematopoietic malignancies.

Mice with a targeted disruption in the IFN-gamma receptor gene (IFN-gamma R0/0)
provided a useful model to ask to what extent other cytokines could replace
IFN-gamma in macrophage activation. In thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal
macrophages from wild-typy (WT) mice, TNF enhanced nitric oxide (NO) release in
the presence of IFN-gamma, though TNF alone was not effective. In macrophages
from IFN-gamma R0/0 mice, which are not responsive to IFN-gamma, TNF completely
failed to stimulate NO release. The NO inducing effects of IFN-alpha/beta were
indistinguishable in IFN-gamma R0/0 and WT macrophages. The important role of
IFN-gamma in the regulation of the induced expression of MHC class II antigen
(Ia) was confirmed by showing that after systemic infection with the BCG strain
of Mycobacterium bovis, peritoneal macrophages from IFN-gamma R0/0 mice had a
lower level of Ia expression than macrophages from WT mice. BCG infection was not
lethal for WT mice whereas all IFN-gamma R0/0 mice died 7-9 weeks after
infection. It is well known that BCG infection greatly sensitizes mice to lethal 
action of LPS. Injection of LPS 2 weeks after BCG inoculation was significantly
less lethal for IFN-gamma R0/0 mice than for WT mice. Reduced lethality of LPS
correlated with a drastically reduced TNF-alpha production in the IFN-gamma R0/0 
mice after BCG infection and LPS challenge. The greatly reduced ability of
BCG-infected IFN-gamma R0/0 mice to produce TNF-alpha may be an important factor 
in their inability to resist BCG infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The interferon-beta promoter binding protein, IRF-2, is proteolytically processed
during induction by double-stranded RNA to leave an N-terminal fragment that can 
still bind to DNA. An N-terminal fragment that corresponds to the
induction-specific product has a higher affinity for the promoter and is a more
potent repressor of interferon-beta transcription than the full-length precursor.
The kinetics of production of the cleavage product is slower than that of
activation of interferon-beta transcription. These results suggest that cleavage 
of IRF-2 functions to generate a postinduction repressor of interferon-beta
expression.

Nb2-11C cell line, and the protein-coding region is identical to that of the
PRL-R isolated from the PRL-independent cell line Nb2-Sp. Short, Nb2, and long
forms of the PRL-R were analyzed for signal transduction to the immediate-early
gene, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and for cellular proliferation.
Receptor and IRF-1-CAT reporter constructs were transiently cotransfected into
the interleukin-3-dependent cell lines FDC-P1 and BaF3. The Nb2 PRL-R induced
IRF-1-CAT 14.3-fold on addition of PRL, while the long PRL-R induced IRF-1-CAT
5.6-fold in FDC-P1 cells. The short PRL-R did not activate the IRF-1 promoter.
Stable transfectants were also generated by selecting for growth in PRL. Only the
Nb2 and long forms were able to convert the IL-3-dependent cells to
PRL-dependence. IRF-1-CAT was induced in these cell lines by the Nb2 PRL-R 10- to
12-fold and long PRL-R 3- to 3.5-fold. Overall, the Nb2 form is more efficient
than the long form by about 3-fold at inducing IRF-1-CAT. A PRL dose-response
growth curve showed that the Nb2 form requires 20-fold less PRL for half maximal 
growth than the long form. A PRL dose-response for IRF-1-CAT activity gave
similar results, indicating a tight correlation between IRF-1 induction and cell 
proliferation. These results show that the short PRL-R does not signal to IRF-1
or for growth, and that the Nb2 PRL-R signals more efficiently than the long
PRL-R.

Mice devoid of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) show normal expression of
type I interferon genes.

Reis LF(1), Ruffner H, Stark G, Aguet M, Weissmann C.

(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie I, Universität Zürich, Switzerland.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) binds tightly to 
the interferon (IFN)-beta promoter and has been implicated in the induction of
type I IFNs. We generated mice devoid of functional IRF-1 by targeted gene
disruption. As reported by others, IRF-1-deficient mice showed a discrete
phenotype: the CD4/CD8 ratio was increased and IFN-gamma-induced levels of
macrophage iNO synthase mRNA were strongly diminished. However, type I IFN
induction in vivo by virus or double-stranded RNA was unimpaired, as evidenced by
serum IFN titers and IFN mRNA levels in spleen, liver and lung. There was also no
impairment in the response of type I IFN-inducible genes. Therefore, IRF-1 is not
essential for these processes in vivo.

Suppression of c-myc or fosB-induced cell transformation by the transcription
factor IRF-1.

Tanaka N(1), Ishihara M, Taniguchi T.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.

The transcriptional activator IRF-1 and its antagonistic repressor IRF-2 are
regulators of the interferon (IFN) system and of cell growth. Overexpression of
IRF-2 leads to transformation of NIH3T3 cells, and the concomitant overexpression
of IRF-1 reverts this transformed phenotype. Here we report that c-myc- or
fosB-transformed rat embryonic fibroblast cells can be reverted by the
introduction of the IRF-1 gene. Thus, the anti-oncogenic function of IRF-1 is not
limited to only IRF-2 overexpressing cells, suggesting the broad role of IRF-1 as
a tumor suppressor.

In vivo footprinting of the IRF-1 promoter: inducible occupation of a GAS element
next to a persistent structural alteration of the DNA.

Rein T(1), Müller M, Zorbas H.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany.

GAS (gamma activated sequence) and GAS-like elements are found in a rapidly
growing number of genes. Data from EMSA (electromobility shift assay) and
transient transfection assays using heterologous promoter systems do not
necessarily reflect transcriptional involvement and protein occupation of a
binding site in vivo. This has been shown recently by in vivo footprinting of the
NF-kappa B site at -40 in the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) promoter.
Here we show by in vivo footprinting using dimethylsulfate (DMS) that the GAS of 
the IRF-1 promoter, which also contains an overlapping putative NF-kappa B site, 
is occupied upon treatment with gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) but not with phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Irrespective of induction, we detect a very strong
DMS hypersensitivity at a guanosine just adjacent to GAS and a less persistent
minor DMS hypersensitivity at a central cytosine. Our data confirm the crucial
role of GAS in transcriptional activation by IFN gamma and are consistent with
induced binding of p91 to GAS. In addition, our data suggest a major
conformational distortion of the DNA at the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter and
that this GAS element is not involved in transcriptional activation by PMA.

Induction of multiple cytokine gene expression and IRF-1 mRNA by flavone acetic
acid in a murine macrophage cell line.

Flavone-8-acetic (FAA) acid is a potential chemotherapeutic agent that has
demonstrated strong immunomodulatory activity in murine model systems. The
immunomodulatory activity of this drug in murine systems has been linked to its
ability to rapidly induce cytokine gene expression in vivo and in mouse
splenocytes ex vivo. We have now developed a tissue culture model for studying
the molecular basis of induction of cytokine expression by FAA. Using the mouse
macrophage cell line, ANA-1, we can demonstrate the direct induction of
interferon beta (IFN beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF alpha), and interferon response factor-1 (IRF-1) mRNA expression following
treatment with FAA. Furthermore, the induction of the IFN beta mRNA can occur in 
the absence of new protein synthesis. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that at
least part of the induction of IFN beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha mRNA occurs at the
transcriptional level while the increase in IRF-1 mRNA appears largely
post-transcriptional or due to the production of IFN beta protein. Additionally, 
experiments using agents that interfere with second messengers demonstrate that
activation of the protein kinase C pathway is possibly involved in FAA gene
induction. The use of this tissue culture model system should lead to a more
complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in FAA-induced gene expression 
and help determine why this drug is inactive on human cells.

Recent progress in the elucidation of interferon-gamma actions: molecular biology
and biological functions.

Vilcek J(1), Oliveira IC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, New York University Medical Center, NY 10016.

It has been known for a long time that the two major classes of interferons,
IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma, are similar in many of their actions despite the
fact that they are structurally unrelated and bind to separate receptors. Recent 
studies revealed overlapping, common components in IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma
signaling. The second chain of the IFN-gamma receptor was recently identified.
The generation of mice with targeted disruptions of the genes for IFN-gamma or
the IFN-gamma receptor is helping to understand the essential functions of
IFN-gamma in host defenses. Other studies have shown that the transcription
factor IRF-1 is essential for the IFN-gamma-mediated activation of the gene for
the inducible nitric oxide synthase.

IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a conditional repressor of IFN 
inducible promoters.

Weisz A(1), Kirchhoff S, Levi BZ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Food Engineering & Biotechnology, Technion, Haifa, Israel.

IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) contain common DNA motif termed IFN consensus
sequence (ICS) at their promoters that enable IFN responsiveness. Different
transcription factors capable of interacting with the ICS have been described.
Previously, we reported the cloning of a factor capable of binding to the ICS
(ICSBP) that demonstrates similarity at DNA the binding domain with three other
ICS binding factor, i.e. IRF-1, IRF-2 and ISGF3 gamma. ICSBP is expressed
constitutively in hematopoietic cells and its expression is further induced by
IFN-gamma. This is a negative trans-acting regulator of ISGs; however, its effect
is attenuated following prolonged exposures of cells to both types of IFNs. In
this communication, we show that short exposures of cells to IFNs (priming) are
sufficient to alleviate ICSBP mediated repression. Further, exposure of primed
cells to the synthetic dsRNA (polyl-polyC) results in total abrogation of ICSBP
repression. In an attempt to unravel the molecular mechanism governing this
conditional repression of ICSBP, the direct involvement of transcriptional
activator IRF-1 is demonstrated. We postulate that constitutive expression of
ICSBP in hematopoietic cells is mediating submaximal expression of ISGs such as
MHC class I. Our data demonstrate that IRF-1 competes with ICSBP for the binding 
to the ISRE element, resulting in the alleviation of ICSBP repression. Thus, the 
magnitude of ISGs expression is a result of a fine balance between positive and
negative regulators.

Possible role of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1)

In this report we discuss the role of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in
the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) transcription during IFN gamma
human macrophage activation. We show that a binding sequence for the
transcription factor IRF-1 is contained in the first intron of the human ODC gene
(from nt +2711 to nt +2722) and we demonstrate that the level of expression of
IRF-1 increases in human macrophages and in the human promonocytic cell line,
U937, previously differentiated in monocytes/macrophages by phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA), after 2 h of IFN gamma stimulation. We also show that the hamster 
tk-ts13 cell line, stably transfected with the IRF-1 cDNA, over-expresses ODC. In
addition, a specific complex was detected, by gel-shift assay after incubating a 
20 bp double-stranded oligomer containing the binding sequence for IRF-1 with
nuclear proteins extracted from human macrophages and from (PMA-differentiated)
U937 cells stimulated with IFN gamma for 2 h.

Research, Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital Montreal, Quebec Canada.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 are structurally similar
but functionally distinct transcription factors that bind to the positive
regulatory domains I and III (PRDI/III) within the human IFN-beta promoter. To
begin structure-function analysis of IRF-1 and IRF-2, the regulatory potential of
carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants was analyzed by co-transfection studies in
human cells and was correlated with DNA binding capacity. Transcriptional
repression by IRF-2 was contained within the first 125 amino-terminal amino acids
and correlated directly with IRF-2 DNA binding; deletion to a protein of 100
amino acids resulted in loss of repression and IRF-2 DNA binding. Thus, the
carboxyl terminus appears dispensible for trans-repression. Hybrid constructs
which fuse the DNA binding domain of IRF-1 and IRF-2 to the trans-activation
domain of NF-kappa B p65 were also generated; both IRF-1/p65 and IRF-2/p65
chimeras were strong transcriptional activators. IRF-2-mediated repression was
also dominant over trans-activation by these fusion proteins. The
trans-activation region of IRF-1 resides in the carboxyl terminus, primarily
carboxyl-terminal to amino acid 250. Mutation of three potential casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites within the IRF carboxyl terminus failed to identify an
essential site that contributes to IRF-1 trans-activation potential.

Differentiation primary response genes and proto-oncogenes as positive and
negative regulators of terminal hematopoietic cell differentiation.

Liebermann DA(1), Hoffman B.

Author information: 
(1)Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University,
School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140.

By genetically manipulating hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage, including
both normal cells and differentiation inducible leukemic cell lines, evidence was
obtained to indicate that myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes
and proto-oncogenes, which are known to control cell growth, function as positive
and negative regulators of terminal hematopoietic cell differentiation, which is 
associated with inhibition of cell growth, and, ultimately programmed cell death 
(apoptosis). Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), an MyD gene induced by
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) or Leukemia Inhibitory factor (LIF), plays a role in growth 
inhibition associated with terminal differentiation. Leucine zipper transcription
factors of the fos/jun family, also identified as MyD genes, function as positive
regulators of hematopoietic cell differentiation, increasing the propensity of
myeloblastic leukemia cells to be induced for differentiation in vitro, and
reducing the aggressiveness of their leukemic phenotype in vivo. The zinc finger 
transcription factor EGR-1, an MyD gene specifically induced upon macrophage
differentiation, was shown to be essential for and to restrict differentiation
along the macrophage lineage. Finally, evidence has been accumulating to indicate
that the novel MyD genes--MyD116, MyD118 and gadd45 (a member in the MyD118 gene 
family)--play a role in growth arrest and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, as
well as other cell types. The proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb, known to regulate 
cellular growth, were shown to function as negative regulators of terminal
differentiation. Both c-myc and c-myb are normally expressed in proliferating
myeloblasts and suppressed following induction of differentiation. Deregulated
and continuous expression of c-myc was shown to block terminal myeloid
differentiation at an intermediate stage in the progression from immature blasts 
to mature macrophages, whereas deregulated and continuous expression of c-myb
blocked the terminal differentiation program at the immature myeloblast stage. By
manipulating myc function in conditional (differentiation inducible) mutant
myeloblastic leukemia cell lines, expressing a chimeric mycer transgene, it was
shown that there is a window during myeloid differentiation, after the addition
of the differentiation inducer, when the terminal differentiation program
switches from being dependent on c-myc suppression to becoming c-myc suppression 
independent, and where activation of c-myc has no apparent effect on mature
macrophages. These myeloblastic leukemia cell lines provide a powerful tool to
increase our understanding of the role of c-myc in normal hematopoiesis and in
leukemogenesis, while also providing a strategy to clone myc target
genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The mechanisms underlying interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral states are not well 
understood. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is an IFN-inducible
transcriptional activator, whereas IRF-2 suppresses IRF-1 action. The inhibition 
of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) replication by IFN-alpha and especially by
IFN-gamma was impaired in cells from mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene 
(IRF-1-/- mice). The IRF-1-/- mice were less resistant than normal mice to EMCV
infection, as revealed by accelerated mortality and a larger virus titer in
target organs. The absence of IRF-1 did not clearly affect replication of two
other types of viruses. Thus, IRF-1 is necessary for the antiviral action of IFNs
against some viruses, but IFNs activate multiple activation pathways through
diverse target genes to induce the antiviral state.

Cellular commitment to oncogene-induced transformation or apoptosis is dependent

The transcriptional activator interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and its
antagonistic repressor IRF-2 are regulators of the interferon (IFN) system and of
cell growth. Here we report that embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) from mice with a
null mutation in the IRF-1 gene (IRF-1-/- mice) can be transformed by expression 
of an activated c-Ha-ras oncogene. This property is not observed in EFs from
wild-type or IRF-2-/- mice but is still observed in EFs from mice deficient in
both genes. The transformed phenotype of ras-expressing IRF-1-/- EFs could be
suppressed by the expression of the IRF-1 cDNA. Thus, IRF-1 functions as a tumor 
suppressor. Furthermore, expression of the c-Ha-ras oncogene causes wild-type but
not IRF-1-/- EFs to undergo apoptosis when combined with a block to cell
proliferation or treated by anticancer drugs or ionizing radiation. Hence, IRF-1 
may be a critical determinant of oncogene-induced cell transformation or
apoptosis.

Interferon (IFN) consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a transcription
factor expressed mostly in the cells of the immune system. ICSBP belongs to the
IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family, which also includes IRF-1, IRF-2, and the
IFN-alpha-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma (ISGF3 gamma). We show here that ICSBP
forms a complex with IRF-1 or IRF-2 both in vivo and in vitro and, in the
presence or absence of the target DNA, with the IFN-stimulated response element
(ISRE). Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that this interaction
greatly enhances the otherwise very low binding affinity of ICSBP to the ISRE. We
show, on the other hand, that ICSBP inhibits binding of the IFN-alpha-stimulated 
gene factor 3 gamma to the ISRE. Through these interactions ICSBP is likely to
exert complex modulatory functions in the regulation of IFN-stimulated genes.

Induction by interleukin-6 of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene
expression through the palindromic interferon response element pIRE and cell
type-dependent control of IRF-1 binding to DNA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, 
Rehovot, Israel.

The effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1)
gene expression were studied in B-hybridoma B9 cells which are growth-stimulated 
by IL-6 and breast carcinoma T47D cells which are growth-inhibited. IL-6 induced 
the production of IRF-1 mRNA and protein in both cell types, but IRF-1 binding
activity to its target DNA sequence was induced only in T47D cells. With B9
cells, there was no IRF-1 binding but instead strong constitutive binding of the 
IRF-2 repressor, indicating that binding of IRF-1 to DNA is an important
regulatory step. The IRF-1 gene promoter element, palindromic IFN-response
element (pIRE), was found to respond to IL-6 with high efficiency as compared
with IFN-gamma or IFN-beta. On this palindromic TTC...GAA sequence, two protein
complexes (pIRE-a and pIRE-b) were induced within minutes by IL-6. pIRE-b is
similar to the main complex induced by IFN-gamma and contains the Stat91 protein.
pIRE-a predominantly induced by IL-6 is a slowly migrating complex which does not
contain Stat91 and has low affinity for IFN-gamma activated sequence (GAS)-type
sequences. Comparison of the relative effects of IL-6 and IFN-gamma shows that
pIRE enhancers are differently regulated than GAS elements. Distinct
transcription complexes, forming in ratios dependent on the inducer, help explain
how various cytokines sharing effects through Stat91 on related enhancers can
produce specific patterns of gene expression. Activation of the pIRE-a factors
defines a novel transcriptional activity of IL-6 in epithelial and lymphoid
cells.

Cytokines that associate with the signal transducer gp130 activate the

Author information: 
(1)Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland
20892.

Interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M exert a broad range
of similar biological activities through association of their receptors with the 
signal-transducing component gp130. Although it is known that these cytokines
trigger rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a common set of cellular proteins as
well as induction of several of the same early response genes, the mechanisms by 
which these genes are activated is not well understood. In this report, we show
that interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M stimulate the
assembly of protein complexes that recognize conserved sequences within the
enhancers of two genes (interferon regulatory factor 1 and Fc gamma receptor type
I) that are rapidly activated by these cytokines. These enhancers are known to be
required for transcriptional induction of these genes by interferon-gamma.
Assembly of the DNA-binding protein complexes occurs within minutes after ligand 
addition and depends upon tyrosine phosphorylation. These complexes contain the
p91 transcription factor, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to these
cytokines. An additional tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 93 kDa can be
coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against p91. These findings further expand
the network of cytokines known to activate p91 and, in addition, support the
concept that sets of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins may be responsible for the 
cytokine-regulated expression of early response genes.

Multiple regulatory elements are required to direct trophoblast interferon gene
expression in choriocarcinoma cells and trophectoderm.

Leaman DW(1), Cross JC, Roberts RM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211.

Interferon-tau (IFN tau) is produced exclusively by the trophectoderm during the 
peri-implantation stage of pregnancy in ruminant ungulate species. Human
choriocarcinoma cells (Jar) stably transfected with 1.8 kilobases of promoter
from a bovine IFN tau gene ahead of a human GH (hGH) reporter gene constitutively
synthesize hGH, but expression is not increased further by exposure to Newcastle 
disease virus. This and earlier experiments suggest that the transcriptional cues
regulating IFN tau expression are distinct from those operating on other type I
IFN genes. Transient transfection experiments reveal that two distinct promoter
regions are required for full constitutive expression: one proximal (to position 
-126), which directs basal expression, and a more distal promoter region
(positions -280 to -400), which acts as an enhancer. Nuclear extracts prepared
from ovine conceptuses during the period of IFN tau expression interact with the 
proximal promoter region (positions -34 to -126) to form several complexes of
high electrophoretic mobility. Although nucleotide sequence motifs potentially
capable of binding the transcription factor IRF-1 are present in this region,
IRF-1 does not transactivate the IFN tau gene. The distal part of the promoter
contains only one region (-322 to -358) that forms a complex with these conceptus
nuclear extracts. Both proximal and distal gel shift patterns become dramatically
different when IFN tau gene expression ceases, perhaps reflecting the appearance 
of transcriptional repressors. Together these experiments support the conclusion 
that the control of IFN tau gene expression is very different from that of other 
type I IFN genes and that trophoblast-specific expression depends upon distal as 
well as proximal promoter regulatory elements.

Requirement for transcription factor IRF-1 in NO synthase induction in

Production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages is important for the killing of
intracellular infectious agents. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and lipopolysaccharide
stimulate NO production by transcriptionally up-regulating the inducible NO
synthase (iNOS). Macrophages from mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene (IRF-1-/- mice) produced little or no NO and
synthesized barely detectable iNOS messenger RNA in response to stimulation. Two 
adjacent IRF-1 response elements were identified in the iNOS promoter. Infection 
with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) was more severe in IRF-1-/- mice than in wild-type
mice. Thus, IRF-1 is essential for iNOS activation in murine macrophages.

Multiple prolactin-responsive elements mediate G1 and S phase expression of the
interferon regulatory factor-1 gene.

Stevens AM(1), Yu-Lee LY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine,
Houston, Texas 77030.

The interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene is both an immediate-early G1
phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes. To
understand the mechanism by which PRL regulates the biphasic expression of IRF-1,
we cloned the rat IRF-1 gene and functionally characterized the IRF-1 promoter.
Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells, 1.7 kilobases (kb) of IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA
linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene mediated a
30-fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation. 
Deletion mutants containing 1.3, 0.6, and 0.2 kb 5'-flanking DNA were
incrementally less transcriptionally active, although 0.2 kb still mediated a
12-fold induction by PRL. The sequence between -1.7 and -0.2 kb linked to a
heterologous thymidine kinase promoter failed to respond to PRL stimulation,
suggesting that the activity of upstream PRL response elements may require an
interaction with promoter-proximal elements. By assaying CAT enzyme activity
across a 24-h PRL induction time course, we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase
PRL responses of the IRF-1 gene to different regions of the IRF-1 5'-flanking and
promoter DNA. The 0.2-kb IRF-CAT construct was induced by PRL stimulation during 
the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, the 1.7-kb IRF-CAT construct was
inducible by PRL during both G1 and S phase of the cell cycle. Hence, the
PRL-induced biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene appears to be controlled by
separate PRL-responsive elements: elements in the first 0.2 kb of the IRF-1
promoter region act during early activation, and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb

elements.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induce a partially
overlapping set of genes, including the genes for interferon regulatory factor 1 
(IRF-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and the acute-phase protein 
alpha 2-macroglobulin. We report here that the rat alpha 2-macroglobulin promoter
is activated by IFN-gamma in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells and that the IFN-gamma 
response element maps to the same site previously defined as the acute-phase
response element (APRE), which binds the IL-6-activated transcription factor APRF
(acute-phase response factor). As was reported for fibroblasts, the
IFN-gamma-regulated transcription factor GAF is phosphorylated at tyrosine after 
IFN-gamma treatment of HepG2 cells. IFN-gamma posttranslationally activates a
protein which specifically binds to the alpha 2-macroglobulin APRE. This protein 
is shown to be identical or closely related to GAF. Although APRF and GAF are
shown to represent different proteins, their binding sequence specificities are
very similar. APRF and GAF bind equally well to the APRE sequences of various
acute-phase protein genes as well as to the IFN-gamma response elements of the
IRF-1, ICAM-1, and other IFN-gamma-inducible genes. Transient transfection
analysis revealed that the IFN-gamma response elements of the IRF-1 and ICAM-1
promoters are able to confer responsiveness to both IFN-gamma and IL-6 onto a
heterologous promoter. Therefore, APRF and GAF are likely to be involved in the
transcriptional induction of these immediate-early genes by IL-6 and IFN-gamma,
respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that two functionally
distinct hormones, IL-6 and IFN-gamma, act through common regulatory elements to 
which different transcription factors sharing almost the same sequence
specificity bind.

Human interferon regulatory factor 2 gene. Intron-exon organization and
functional analysis of 5'-flanking region.

Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a transcriptional regulatory protein
that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory
factor 1. In this study, we isolated the genomic DNA for human IRF-2 gene,
determined the intron-exon structure of the human IRF-2 gene, mapped the major
transcription initiation site, identified a number of potential regulatory
elements in the 5'-flanking region, and localized the IRF-2 gene on human
chromosome 4. The IRF-2 promoter region contains a CpG island, with several GC
boxes, a putative NF-kappa B-binding site, and a CAAT box, but no TATA box. When 
the promoter region was linked with a heterologous reporter gene, we found that
the promoter region is inducible by both interferons (interferon-alpha and
-gamma) and interferon regulatory factor 1. The region which induced these
inductions was identified as being confined to 40 nucleotides 5' to the major
transcriptional initiation site by testing a series of clones with truncated
promoter of IRF-2. This region contains elements which are shared with the
transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor
1, interferon beta, and interferon-inducible genes. These data suggest that
interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon
signal transduction pathway, but also may play a role in limiting the duration of
this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2.

Reversal of interferon-gamma-resistant phenotype by poly(I:C): possible
involvement of ISGF2 (IRF1) in interferon-gamma-mediated induction of the IDO
gene.

Ozes ON(1), Taylor MW.

Author information:

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is induced in many cell lines by
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment. IDO mRNA increases rapidly from 4 h after
IFN-gamma treatment to at least 24 h after treatment in ME180 cells. The
IFN-gamma-resistant mutant of ME180, IR3B6B, expresses only one-sixth the amount 
of IDO message after IFN-gamma treatment and very low levels of IDO. However,
pretreatment of these mutants with poly(I:C) restores normal levels of IDO mRNAs 
and IDO activity. Since IRF1 mRNA induction is also low in IR3B6B cells after
IFN-gamma treatment, we examined whether there was any relationship between IRF1 
induction and IDO induction by IFN-gamma. The steady-state level of IRF1 mRNA was
elevated by treating IR3B6B cells with poly(I:C) and IFN-gamma.
Poly(I:C)-mediated reversal of IFN-gamma-resistant phenotype and induction of IDO
and IRF1 messages are inhibited by 2-aminopurine. Transient transfection of IRF1 
cDNA in ME180 cells resulted in activation of IDO transcription. Nuclear extracts
prepared from IFN-gamma-treated ME180 and IR3B6B cells affected differently the
mobility of a 80-bp DNA fragment of the 5' regulatory region of IDO gene.
Pretreatment of IR3B6B cells with poly(I:C) and addition of IFN-gamma resulted in
increased DNA binding of nuclear proteins to the DNA. Pre- and post-treatment of 
nuclear extract of IFN-gamma-treated ME180 cells with anti-IRF1 antibody resulted
in a super shift in mobility of the probe with the abolishment of normal
gel-shift pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Structure and regulation of the human interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and 
IRF-2 genes: implications for a gene network in the interferon system.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 are structurally similar
DNA-binding factors which were originally identified as regulators of the type I 
interferon (IFN) system; the former functions as a transcriptional activator, and
the latter represses IRF-1 function by competing for the same cis elements. More 
recent studies have revealed new roles of the two factors in the regulation of
cell growth; IRF-1 and IRF-2 manifest antioncogenic and oncogenic activities,
respectively. In this study, we determined the structures and chromosomal
locations of the human IRF-1 and IRF-2 genes and further characterized the
promoters of the respective genes. Comparison of exon-intron organization of the 
two genes revealed a common evolutionary structure, notably within the exons
encoding the N-terminal portions of the two factors. We confirmed the chromosomal
mapping of the human IRF-1 gene to 5q31.1 and newly assigned the IRF-2 gene to
4q35.1, using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The 5' regulatory regions of
both genes contain highly GC-rich sequences and consensus binding sequences for
several known transcription factors, including NF-kappa B. Interestingly, one IRF
binding site was found within the IRF-2 promoter, and expression of the IRF-2
gene was affected by both transient and stable IRF-1 expression. In addition, one
potential IFN-gamma-activated sequence was found within the IRF-1 promoter. Thus,
these results may shed light on the complex gene network involved in regulation
of the IFN system.

Tyrosine phosphorylated p91 binds to a single element in the ISGF2/IRF-1 promoter
to mediate induction by IFN alpha and IFN gamma, and is likely to autoregulate
the p91 gene.

Pine R(1), Canova A, Schindler C.

Author information:

ISGF2 was initially identified, purified and cloned as an interferon-alpha (IFN
alpha) induced transcription factor that binds to the IFN-stimulated response
element (ISRE) of IFN alpha/beta-stimulated genes (ISGs). It was reported to be
transcriptionally regulated by several cytokines including IFN alpha and IFN
gamma. IFN alpha and IFN gamma inducibility is mediated by a single element: a
high affinity, nearly palindromic version of the IFN gamma activation site (GAS).
The ISGF2 GAS is bound specifically by p91, which was previously identified as a 
subunit of the ISG activator ISGF3, and shown to mediate IFN gamma induction of
the GBP gene via a GAS. Tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of p91 
parallel transcription of ISGF2 in response to IFN alpha and/or IFN gamma,
consistent with induction mediated by only a GAS. Transcription of the genes that
encode p91 and p113, another subunit of ISGF3, is activated only by IFN alpha.
This result suggests induction mediated by an ISRE, and implies autoregulation,
requiring the products of both genes. Specificity of the ISRE is the basis for
the previous conclusion. In contrast, it appears likely that the ISGF2 GAS, and
p91 or related factors, also mediate induction of ISGF2 by IL-6 and prolactin.
Convergence of signalling pathways from at least four cytokines on this single
site would thus be a key aspect of a general role for ISGF2 in cellular growth
control.

Characterization of a novel IRF-1-deficient mutant cell line.

The transcriptional activation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I genes by both type I (alpha/beta) and II (gamma) interferons (IFNs) has
been extensively studied, and it has been shown that the upregulation of several 
DNA-binding proteins is critical for this process. In our laboratory, we
introduced the mouse H-2Kb gene into the AKR mouse leukaemia cell line K36.16 to 
effect the generation of tumor-specific immunity. Individual clones were selected
and studied. Whereas the MHC class I genes in most of the clones obtained could
be stimulated by interferons, one of the clones obtained, clone Kb-S27, failed to
be induced, or was at best poorly induced by IFN-alpha/beta and -gamma. Both the 
exogenous H-2Kb and the endogenous H-2Dk genes behaved in the same manner and
were not stimulated by IFNs. The lack of response to IFNs by clone Kb-S27 also
resulted in its resistance to the antiproliferative effects of IFNs. This lack of
IFN-induction by clone Kb-S27 was not simply due to a change in its surface
interferon receptors. Gel-retardation assay and northern blot analysis both
demonstrated the lack of induction of the IRF-1 DNA-binding factor in clone
Kb-S27. In addition, northern blot analysis showed that the IRF-2 gene expression
in clone Kb-S27 was upregulated when compared with the other IFN-inducible
clones.

HLA-A and -B transplantation antigens can be expressed differentially at the
basal level and in response to interferons (IFNs). To determine which DNA control
elements and nuclear factors are responsible for these differences, HLA-A and -B 
upstream regulatory regions were used in expression and mobility-shift analyses. 
The HLA-A enhancer was found to contain two Rel (KBF/NF-kappa B) binding motifs, 
while the HLA-B enhancer has only one and is transactivated less well by
overexpression of the NF-kappa B p65 subunit. On the other hand, the HLA-B IFN
response element mediates a much stronger induction by IFNs and has a higher
affinity for IRF-1 and -2, which are transcription factors implicated in the
regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I genes. These results
suggest a molecular basis for the way in which HLA-A and -B loci have adapted to 
be differentially expressed and to respond to different sets of cytokine signals.

Induction of type I interferon genes and interferon-inducible genes in embryonal 
stem cells devoid of interferon regulatory factor 1.

Ruffner H(1), Reis LF, Näf D, Weissmann C.

Author information: 
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie I, University of Zürich, Switzerland.

Overexpression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) can induce expression of
the interferon (IFN) beta gene, at least in certain cells. A role of IRF-1 in the
activation of IFN-alpha genes has also been claimed. We have generated embryonal 
stem cells in which both IRF-1 alleles were disrupted. In undifferentiated
embryonal stem cells, virus-induced levels of IFN-alpha RNA were similar for
wild-type and IRF-1%, and there was little induction of IFN-beta RNA in either
cell type. In 8-day differentiated cells, the levels of virus-induced IFN-beta
RNA, but not of IFN-alpha RNA, were about 10-fold higher than in undifferentiated
cells and only slightly higher in wild-type than in IRF-1% cells. Thus, although 
IRF-1 at high levels may elicit or augment induction of IFN genes under certain
circumstances, it is not essential for IFN gene induction by virus. Lack of IRF-1
had no effect on the IFN-induced expression levels of the IFN-inducible genes
tested; however, there was little or no constitutive expression of
(2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase in IRF-1% embryonal stem cells, in contrast to
wild-type cells.

Virus-mediated induction of interferon A gene requires cooperation between

Transcriptional activation of interferon A (IFNA) gene in virus-infected cells is
controlled by a 35-nucleotide inducible element that is cell type specific.
Within this region, two elements, alpha F1 and IRF-1 binding sites, were shown by
mutation analysis to play a crucial role in the expression of inducible element. 
In this study, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins to the alpha F1
sequence and have shown that the induction is associated with the formation of a 
novel complex alpha F1/B, which contains at least two DNA binding proteins of 68 
and 96 kDa. In contrast, no binding of the purified interferon regulatory factor 
1 (IRF-1) either to the alpha F1 or IRF-1 binding sites could be detected in
vitro. However, the oligonucleotides corresponding to alpha F1 or IRF-1 binding
sites competed efficiently for the induction of IFNA4 promoter region in a
transient transfection assay. We suggest that the induction of IFNA promoter
region requires cooperation between alpha F1 binding proteins and IRF-1.
Interestingly, our data also show that the inability of IFNA6 promoter to be
expressed in infected L-cells may be a result of a viral-induced repressor, which
could act by binding and inactivating alpha F1 or by competing for the IRF-1
binding site. These results suggest that cell-specific expression of IFNA genes
results from core-cruitment of trans-acting factors that bind to alpha F1 and the
IRF-1 binding site with the cell-specific virus-induced activator or repressor.

Acquired interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 occur frequently 
in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently 
IRF1, a putative tumor suppressor gene localized to the long arm of chromosome 5,
has been shown to be deleted from the 5q- chromosome in a group of patients with 
MDS and AML. It has been suggested that the loss of IRF1 may be critical to the
development of the 5q- syndrome. We have investigated the allelic loss of IRF1 in
a group of 12 patients with MDS and a 5q deletion and 2 patients with AML and a
5q deletion. Gene dosage experiments demonstrated that 12 of 14 patients had loss
of one allele of the IRF1 gene but no evidence of homozygous loss and that 2
patients with 5q- syndrome retained both copies of the gene. The retention of
IRF1 on the 5q- chromosome in these two cases has been confirmed by fluorescent
in situ hybridization localization using an IRF1 cosmid. Pulsed field gel
electrophoresis was used to determine whether there was any evidence for
structural rearrangement in the region encompassing the IRF1 gene in these two
patients. No aberrant bands were detected with a range of rare cutter enzyme
digests. We conclude that IRF1 maps outside the commonly deleted segment of the
5q- chromosome and that loss of IRF1 is not solely responsible for the
development of the 5q- syndrome.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional activator, and its
antagonistic repressor, IRF-2, were originally identified as regulators of the
type I interferon (IFN) system. We have generated mice deficient in either IRF-1 
or IRF-2 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. IRF-1-deficient fibroblasts
lacked the normally observed type I IFN induction by poly(I):poly(C), while they 
induced type I IFN to similar levels as the wild type following Newcastle disease
virus (NDV) infection. In contrast, IRF-2-deficient fibroblasts showed
up-regulated type I IFN induction by NDV infection. A profound reduction of TCR
alpha beta+CD4-CD8+ T cells in IRF-1-deficient mice, with a thymocyte
developmental defect, reveals a critical role for IRF-1 in T cell development.
IRF-2-deficient mice exhibited bone marrow suppression of hematopoiesis and B
lymphopoiesis and mortality following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
infection.

Priming of human monocytes for enhanced lipopolysaccharide responses: expression 
of alpha interferon, interferon regulatory factors, and tumor necrosis factor.

Culture of human monocytes with either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) results in a primed state, during which
these cells express heightened responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
The production of IFN-alpha in response to LPS by human monocytes has an absolute
requirement for priming. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression is also greatly
enhanced in primed monocytes after LPS stimulation, but unlike IFN-alpha, TNF is 
readily expressed in unprimed monocytes as well. In an effort to determine the
molecular events associated with IFN-alpha induction in this system, freshly
isolated human monocytes were primed by culture with either IFN-gamma or
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and then treated with LPS;
expression of IFN-alpha subtype 2 (IFN-alpha 2), IFN regulatory factors (IRFs),
and TNF was assessed by Northern (RNA blot) analysis. IRF-1 mRNA is expressed at 
high levels in monocytes and is regulated by both LPS and priming cytokines, but 
its expression alone does not correlate with the induction of IFN-alpha 2
expression. IRF-2 mRNA is expressed in a more gradual manner following LPS
stimulation, implying a possible feedback mechanism for inhibiting IFN-alpha
expression. However, nuclear run-on analysis indicates that IFN-alpha 2 is not
transcriptionally modulated in this system, in striking contrast to TNF, which is
clearly regulated at the transcriptional level. In addition, IFN-alpha 2 mRNA
accumulation is superinduced when primed monocytes are treated with LPS plus
cycloheximide, while TNF mRNA is relatively unaffected. The results demonstrate
that priming can affect subsequent LPS-induced gene expression at different
levels in human monocytes.

BACKGROUND: Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional factor
originally cloned from fibroblasts that activates interferons and certain
interferon-responsive genes. Because IRF-1 is an "early-immediate" nuclear
protein, it can function acutely after trauma or septic stimuli. We have
identified IRF-1 expression in hepatocytes in vivo in sepsis. The purpose of this
study was to characterize the cytokine signals that up-regulate IRF-1 messenger
RNA (mRNA) in cultured hepatocytes.
METHODS: Rat hepatocytes were isolated by in situ collagenase perfusion and
stimulated in vitro with cytokines. IRF-1 mRNA levels were determined by Northern
blot hybridization with a DNA probe for hepatocyte IRF-1 generated with reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction with custom-designed oligonucleotide
primers based on the known sequence for T-cell IRF-1.
RESULTS: Northern blot of hepatocyte RNA showed a single IRF-1 mRNA band at
approximately 2.4 Kb. The mRNA levels were markedly up-regulated (vs control
hepatocytes) 2 hours after in vitro stimulation with the cytokines
interferon-gamma (17-fold), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (3-fold), and
interleukin-1 beta (2-fold). Lipopolysaccharide had no direct effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that IRF-1 is up-regulated in hepatocytes
primarily in response to interferon-gamma and to a lesser extent after tumor
necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 beta stimulation. This suggests that IRF-1
plays a role in regulating liver gene expression in sepsis; however, the specific
genes controlled by IRF-1 remain to be determined.

regulators of cell growth and the interferon system.

(1)Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 were originally identified
as transcription factors involved in the regulation of the IFN system. IRF-1
functions as a transcriptional activator, while IRF-2 represses IRF-1 function.
More recently, evidence has been provided that IRF-1 and IRF-2 manifest
antioncogenic and oncogenic properties, respectively, and that loss of one or
both of the IRF-1 alleles may be critical for the development of human
hematopoietic neoplasms. Both factors show a high degree of structural similarity
in their N-terminal DNA-binding domains, and previous studies suggested that
IRF-1 and IRF-2 bind to similar or identical cis elements within type I IFN
(IFN-alpha and -beta) and IFN-inducible genes. However, the exact recognition
sequences of these two factors have not yet been determined; hence, the spectrum 
of the IRF-responsive genes remains unclear. In this study, we determined the DNA
sequences recognized by IRF-1 and IRF-2, using a polymerase chain
reaction-assisted DNA-binding site selection method. We report that sequences
selected by this method and the affinities for each sequence were virtually
indistinguishable between IRF-1 and IRF-2. We confirm the presence of two
contiguous IRF recognition sequences within the promoter region of the IFN-beta
gene and of at least one such sequence in all of the IFN-inducible genes
examined. Furthermore, we report the presence of potential IRF sequences in the
upstream region of several genes involved in cell growth control.

Pretreatment of L929 cells with IFN enhances Sendai virus-mediated induction of
IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFNA and IFNB genes. The priming effect could be
demonstrated at both the RNA and protein levels and the former did not require
cellular protein synthesis. Priming increased the Sendai virus-mediated induction
of a murine IFNA4 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene hybrid plasmid 
(A4CAT) in transiently transfected cells, and deletion analysis showed that the
identical DNA sequence was required for the inducibility in primed and unprimed
cells. Cotransfection of A4CAT plasmid with interferon regulatory factor-1
(IRF-1) expression plasmid increased CAT expression, however, the IRF-1-mediated 
expression was further enhanced by priming. These results show that the identical
inducible element present in the promoter region of IFNA4 gene is required for
both the inducibility and the priming effect; however, no direct correlation
between the enhancement of expression of the IRF-1 gene and enhancement of
expression of IFN, IL-6, and TNF-alpha genes in the primed cells was observed. We
suggest that priming facilitates inducer-mediated posttranscriptional modulation 
of various transcriptional factors that play a role in stimulation of
transcription of these genes.

Tumor-suppressor genes: news about the interferon connection.

(1)Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New
Haven, CT 06511.

The interferons are a family of secreted, multifunctional proteins which are
components of the defenses of vertebrates against viral, bacterial, and parasitic
infections and certain tumors. They exert their various activities by inducing
the synthesis of a large variety of proteins. There are direct and indirect
indications that several of these proteins may have tumor-suppressor activities. 
The interferon-inducible proteins implicated include: (i) a double-stranded
RNA-activatable protein kinase that can phosphorylate and thereby inactivate the 
eukaryotic peptide chain initiation factor eIF-2; (ii) the interferon regulatory 
factors IRF-1 and IRF-2, which can modulate the expression of the interferons and
of some interferon-inducible proteins; and (iii) RNase L, a latent
endoribonuclease which can be activated by (2'-5')oligoadenylates, the products
of a family of enzymes which are also interferon-inducible. It is note-worthy
that some of the proteins encoded by tumor virus oncogenes (e.g., E1A from
adenovirus, EBNA-2 from Epstein-Barr virus, and terminal protein from hepatitis B
virus) impair the induction of at least some proteins by interferons.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) mediates cell growth inhibition by
transactivation of downstream target genes.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a DNA-binding factor which recognizes
regulatory elements in the promoters of interferon (IFN)-beta and some
IFN-inducible genes. We observed that expression of transfected murine IRF-1 in
different mammalian cell lines leads to down-regulation or stop of proliferation 
depending on the extent of expression. Expression of fusion proteins composed of 
IRF-1 and the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor does not
exhibit IRF-1 activity in the absence of estrogen. However, after estrogen
treatment of the cells IFN-beta promoters are activated and the cells stop
growing. As shown by expression of IRF-1 mutants both functions of the
IRF-1-protein require DNA-binding and transcriptional activation. Since secreted 
factors including IFNs are not responsible for the anti-proliferative effect of
IRF-1 we suggest that IRF-1 may be regarded as a negative regulator of cell
growth which acts by activation of down-stream effector genes.

The interferon-stimulable response elements of two human genes detect overlapping
sets of transcription factors.

We have previously reported three types of DNA-protein complexes, formed
specifically with the interferon-stimulable response elements (ISRE) in the 5'
flanking DNA of the interferon-inducible 6-16 and 9-27 genes, a type-I
interferon-inducible early complex involving factor E (ISGF3), M and G complexes 
induced more slowly in response to type-I and type-II interferons, respectively
and C1/C2, a constitutive complex(s). Similar complexes have been reported by
others. The operationally defined band-shift complexes M, G and C1/C2 are shown
here to be heterogeneous and to differ in their factor content, depending on the 
ISRE probe. With a 9-27 ISRE probe the M, G and C1/C2 complexes all contain the
gamma subunit of ISGF3, which is present constitutively but is induced in
response to IFN-alpha (to yield M) or IFN-gamma (to yield G). In contrast, a 6-16
ISRE probe forms band-shift complexes with IFN-alpha-inducible and
IFN-gamma-inducible IRF1 and IRF2. With a 6-16 ISRE probe, therefore, M and G
each correspond to two complexes which co-migrate in band-shift assays, one
corresponding to IRF1, the other to IRF2. With this probe, the constitutive
complex C1/C2 corresponds predominantly to IRF2. Consistent with this, IRF1 and
IRF2 have lower affinity for the 9-27 ISRE than the 6-16 ISRE, whereas the
reverse is true for E (ISGF3) and its gamma subunit. Relatively small differences
in affinity appear sufficient to determine whether or not a band-shift complex is
detected. In the case of IRF1 and IRF2, the different affinities for the 6-16 and
9-27 probes are dominated by a dinucleotide sequence in the centre of the
14-nucleotide 'core' ISRE. In contrast, preferential binding of E (ISGF3) by the 
39-nucleotide 9-27 ISRE-containing sequence, although ISRE dependent, appears to 
be mediated by sequences 3' of the 'core' ISRE. Accordingly, these complexes can 
be simultaneously assayed using a hybrid probe consisting of the 5' flanking
region and 'core' ISRE sequences from the 6-16 gene and sequences immediately 3' 
of the 'core' 9-27 ISRE sequence. No evidence was obtained for a modulatory role 
in factor binding for a pseudo-ISRE sequence close to ISRE in the 9-27 gene. The 
precise roles of IRF1 and IRF2 in the induction of IFN-beta and the control of
interferon-inducible gene expression remain to be established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

A physical map of 15 loci on human chromosome 5q23-q33 by two-color fluorescence 
in situ hybridization.

The q23-q33 region of human chromosome 5 encodes a large number of growth
factors, growth factor receptors, and hormone/neurotransmitter receptors. This is
also the general region into which several disease genes have been mapped,
including diastrophic dysplasia, Treacher Collins syndrome, hereditary startle
disease, the myeloid disorders that are associated with the 5q-syndrome,
autosomal-dominant forms of hereditary deafness, and limb girdle muscular
dystrophy. We have developed a framework physical map of this region using cosmid
clones isolated from the Los Alamos arrayed chromosome 5-specific library. Entry 
points into this library included 14 probes to genes within this interval and one
anonymous polymorphic marker locus. A physical map has been constructed using
fluorescence in situ hybridization of these cosmids on metaphase and interphase
chromosomes, and this is in good agreement with the radiation hybrid map of the
region. The derived order of loci across the region is
cen-IL4-IL5-IRF1-IL3-IL9-EGR1-CD1 4-FGFA-GRL-D5S207-ADRB2-SPARC-RPS14+ ++-CSF1R- 
ADRA1, and the total distance spanned by these loci is approximately 15 Mb. The
framework map, genomic clones, and contig expansion within 5q23-q33 should
provide valuable resources for the eventual isolation of the clinically relevant 
loci that reside in this region.

Interleukin-6 activates and regulates transcription factors of the interferon
regulatory factor family in M1 cells.

Activation of (2'-5') A synthetase gene expression in interleukin-6
(IL-6)-treated myeloleukemic M1 cells correlates with protein binding to the
interferon response sequence enhancer (IRS). A new interferon response sequence
complex, F6, is induced by IL-6 independently of interferon and is identified
here as comprising the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2, by use
of specific antibodies in DNA mobility shift assays with probes containing IRF
binding sites. IRF-1 and IRF-2 have, respectively, positive and negative
transcriptional effects on interferon-beta and interferon-inducible genes. In the
IL-6-treated M1or cells, IRF-1 binding is activated early and maximally at 1 h,
whereas the onset of IRF-2 binding is delayed. In a cell variant M1res, where
(2'-5') A synthetase is no more induced, IRF-2 binding is constitutive, and IRF-1
binding is not seen before or after IL-6 treatment. In sensitive M1or cells, IL-6
rapidly induces IRF-1 mRNA, but in M1res cells, IRF-1 mRNA is constitutively high
and not changed by IL-6. IRF-2 mRNA levels are also constitutive and not
inducible by IL-6 even in M1or cells. The dissociation between induction of mRNAs
and of protein binding observed suggests that the activity of the IRF proteins is
regulated by IL-6. Transcripts of a third member of the IRF gene family, ICSBP,
encoding a protein known to act as repressor, were found to be strongly
down-regulated by IL-6. The rapid activation of IRF-1 and the modulation of the
other transcription factors of this family may play a role in the early phase of 
IL-6 action on the M1 cells.

Two cis-DNA elements involved in myeloid-cell-specific expression and gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) activation of the human high-affinity Fc gamma receptor
gene: a novel IFN regulatory mechanism.

(1)Unité 196 Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Section
Biologie, Institut Curie, Paris, France.

The human high-affinity receptor for the constant region of immunoglobulin G
(human Fc gamma R1) is encoded by two mRNAs induced selectively by gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) and expressed in cells of myeloid lineage. The cis-DNA
element (GRR) previously found to confer IFN-gamma responsiveness to this gene
acts as an inducible enhancer and is the target of an IFN-gamma-activated
factor(s) (GIRE-BP) in cells of different origins. Although the GRR motif is not 
related to the DNA elements involved in the regulation of other IFN-stimulated
genes, GIRE-BP binding depends on the IFN-gamma-dependent activation of the
91-kDa protein known to be one of the factors of a transcriptional complex
activated by IFN-alpha. Deletions of the Fc gamma R1 promoter allowed us to
identify a 25-bp element, downstream from the GRR motif, conferring
cell-type-specific expression. This element, called MATE (myeloid activating
transcription element), is the DNA target for constitutive factors forming two
complexes, MATE-BP1 and MATE-BP2. In accordance with the functional analysis,
MATE-BP binding activities were detected in extracts prepared from myeloid cell
lines such as THP-1, HL-60, and U-937 but not in HeLa cell extracts. The MATE
motif is present not only in the promoter of other Fc receptor genes but also in 
several promoters of genes whose expression is restricted to monocytic cells. Our
results suggest that human Fc gamma R1 gene expression in myeloid cells is
initiated by the interaction of IFN-gamma-activated factors with
cell-type-specific factors through their binding to the GRR and MATE motifs.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional activator, and IRF-2,
its antagonistic repressor, have been identified as regulators of type I
interferon and interferon-inducible genes. The IRF-1 gene is itself
interferon-inducible and hence may be one of the target genes critical for
interferon action. When the IRF-2 gene was overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells, the
cells became transformed and displayed enhanced tumorigenicity in nude mice. This
transformed phenotype was reversed by concomitant overexpression of the IRF-1
gene. Thus, restrained cell growth depends on a balance between these two
mutually antagonistic transcription factors.

One of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in human leukemia and
myelodysplasia is an interstitial deletion within chromosome 5q. A tumor
suppressor gene has been hypothesized to lie in 5q31, the smallest commonly
deleted region. IRF-1, a gene whose product manifests anti-oncogenic activity,
was mapped to 5q31.1. IRF-1 lies between IL-5 and CDC25C and is centromeric to
IL-3 and GM-CSF. Among these genes, only IRF-1 was consistently deleted at one or
both alleles in 13 cases of leukemia or myelodysplasia with aberrations of 5q31. 
Inactivating rearrangements of one IRF-1 allele, accompanied by deletion of the
second allele, were also identified in one case of acute leukemia. Thus, IRF-1
may be a critically deleted gene in human leukemia and myelodysplasia.

Two factors, IRF1 and KBF1/NF-kappa B, cooperate during induction of MHC class I 
gene expression by interferon alpha beta or Newcastle disease virus.

The expression of class I genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex is
stimulated by IFN. The promoter of these genes contains an interferon response
sequence (IRS) which overlaps the major enhancer. These elements are recognized
by several protein factors, including IRF-1, which binds the IRS, and
KBF1/NF-kappa B, which binds the enhancer. We demonstrate here that infection by 
Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) results in an increased expression of class I
genes, by a mechanism partially different from that of IFN, but that in both
cases the cooperative action of IRF1 and KBF1/NF-kappa B is required. In F9
embryonal carcinoma cells, where KBF1/NF-kappa B activity cannot be detected,
both types of stimuli are ineffective.

We have cloned and functionally characterized the human interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF-1) gene promoter. The promoter contains a CpG island, with several 
GC boxes, a CAAT box, but no TATA box. IRF-1 mRNA is strongly induced by gamma
interferon (IFN-gamma) but more weakly and transiently by IFN-alpha. There are
several putative kappa B motifs and numerous AA(G/A)G(G/T)A and GAAANN motifs
throughout the promoter. The IRF-1 promoter is not autoregulated by the IRF-1
gene product. IFN inducibility of the promoter was studied with 5' deletion
mutants linked to a heterologous reporter gene. Gel mobility shift assays were
used to show IFN-inducible factor binding to the IRF-1 promoter. These studies
showed that IFN inducibility is conferred by a novel imperfect inverted-repeat
arrangement of two GAAANN motifs within a domain, 130 nucleotides upstream of
transcription initiation. This inverted repeat binds a factor upon induction with
IFN and can confer IFN inducibility on a heterologous promoter. Conversely, point
mutations of the inverted repeat are not IFN inducible when linked to the same
heterologous promoter.

Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein, a member of the interferon
regulatory factor family, suppresses interferon-induced gene transcription.

and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

We previously isolated a cDNA clone encoding interferon consensus
sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), a member of the interferon regulatory factor
(IRF) family, that binds to the interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element
(ISRE) of many IFN-regulated genes. In this investigation, we studied the
functional role of ICSBP by transient cotransfection of ICSBP cDNA with
IFN-responsive reporter genes into the human embryonal carcinoma cell line
N-Tera2. These cells were shown not to express ICSBP or IRF-2, thus allowing
functional analysis of transfected cDNAs. Cotransfection of ICSBP into cells
treated with retinoic acid or any of the IFNs (alpha, beta, or gamma) repressed
expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter driven by the major
histocompatibility complex class I gene promoter. Similarly, ICSBP repressed
expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporters driven by the ISREs of 
the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, guanylate-binding protein, and ISG-15 genes 
in IFN-treated cells. The repression was dependent on the presence of the ISRE in
the reporter. Deletion analysis showed that the putative N-terminal DNA binding
domain of ICSBP by itself is capable of mediating the repression. Using the same 
cotransfection conditions as for ICSBP, a similar repression of these reporters
was observed with IRF-2. Finally, ICSBP repressed the IRF-1-mediated induction of
major histocompatibility complex class I and IFN-beta reporters in the absence of
IFN or retinoic acid. Taken together, these results suggest that ICSBP is a
negative regulatory factor capable of repressing transcription of target genes
induced by IFN, retinoic acid, or IRF-1.

Identification of a functionally important sequence in the C terminus of the
interferon-gamma receptor.

MO 63110.

We have previously shown that the intracellular domain of the interferon-gamma
(IFN-gamma) receptor plays an obligate role in receptor-mediated signal
transduction. Moreover, we have specifically identified two regions within the
human IFN-gamma receptor's intracellular domain required for functional activity:
the membrane-proximal 48 amino acids required for both functional activity and
receptor-mediated ligand internalization and the C-terminal 39 amino acids
required exclusively for biologic response induction. Herein we report the
identification of the 3 amino acids within the C-terminal region of the receptor 
that are obligatorily required for receptor function. By using a set of
overlapping truncation mutants, the minimal functional sequence within the
C-terminal region was localized to residues 434-444 (APTSFGYD-KPH). By mutating
each individual residue within this sequence to alanine, three residues (Tyr-440,
Asp-441, and His-444) were identified as being critical for IFN-gamma-dependent
(i) upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, (ii)
activation of the IFN regulatory factor 1 gene, and (iii) stimulation of cells to
produce nitric oxide. The more conservative Tyr-440-->Phe substitution also
resulted in a nonfunctional receptor. Subsequent mutational analysis of all five 
of the IFN-gamma receptor's intracellular tyrosine residues revealed that Tyr-440
was the sole tyrosine required for receptor activity. These results thus identify
a unique sequence in the IFN-gamma receptor that is required for initiation of
IFN-gamma-dependent biologic responses and highlight the importance of the
hydroxyl side chain of Tyr-440 in this process.

PRL induces quiescent Nb2 rat T-lymphoma cells to undergo mitogenesis. Upon PRL
stimulation, the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is
induced as a novel T-cell activation gene in Nb2 cells. Surprisingly, IRF-1 is
expressed twice during a single PRL-induced growth cycle: first during the early 
G1 phase, in an immediate transient peak from 15 min to 2 h, and second during
the G1/S phase transition, in a broader peak beginning at 8 h. The unusual
biphasic expression of IRF-1 mRNA is accompanied both times by de novo IRF-1
protein synthesis. However, the rate of IRF-1 protein turnover appears to be
different in G1 and S phases. IRF-1 protein expressed in G1 exhibits a half-life 
of about 25 min, whereas in the S phase, the half-life is about 60 min. By
washing out PRL at various times during G1, we found a direct correlation among
the length of PRL exposure, the second peak of IRF-1 mRNA expression, and DNA
synthesis. Our data suggest that PRL and one putative nuclear mediator, IRF-1,
may be important in two distinct phases of the cell cycle: first in cell cycle
activation, and then in S phase progression.

Double-stranded RNA and interferon-alpha induce transcription through different
molecular mechanisms.

Decker T(1).

Author information: 
(1)Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Molecular Biology, Hannover, Germany.

Double-stranded (ds) RNA stimulates the synthesis of several mRNAs known to be
induced by type I interferons (IFNs). In this report, it is shown that the
IFN-alpha stimulated genes (ISGs) 15, 54, 56, and GBP are transcriptionally
induced by dsRNA. Transcriptional stimulation occurred in the presence of the
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), indicating that inducibility was
directly mediated by dsRNA through the action of preformed proteins. ISGF-3, the 
protein complex mediating primary transcriptional induction of ISGs by IFN-alpha,
was not activated by dsRNA in the presence of CHX. Additionally, DNA-binding
activity of ISGF-2/IRF-1, a protein involved in the regulation of the IFN-beta
gene and ISGs, did not correlate with dsRNA-induced transcriptional induction of 
ISGs. This suggests that dsRNA and IFN-alpha induce ISGs through different
molecular mechanisms.

We have developed modifications to direct cDNA selection that allow the rapid and
reproducible isolation of low abundance cDNAs encoded by large genomic clones.
Biotinylated, cloned genomic DNAs are hybridized in solution with amplifiable
cDNAs. The genomic clones and attached cDNAs are captured on streptavidin coated 
magnetic beads, the cDNAs are eluted and amplified. We have applied this protocol
to a 425kb YAC that contains the human IL4 and IL5 genes. After two cycles of
enrichment twenty-four cDNAs were evaluated, all of which were homologous to the 
YAC. DNA sequencing revealed that nine cDNAs were 100% homologous to the
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) gene. Six clones were 70% homologous to the
murine P600 gene, which is coexpressed with IL4 and IL5 in mouse Th2 cells. The
nine remaining clones were unique within the sequence databases and were non
redundant. All of the selected cDNAs were initially present at very low abundance
and were enriched by as much as 100,000-fold in two cycles of enrichment. This
modified selection technique should be readily applicable to the isolation of
many candidate disease loci as well as the derivation of detailed transcription
maps across large genomic regions.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional regulatory
protein that mediates the transcriptional activation of the IFN-alpha and
IFN-beta genes by viruses and IFNs. To characterize the mechanisms that govern
the level of IRF-1 in cells, we isolated the IRF-1 gene and characterized the
structure of its intronic and exonic domains and of its regulatory promoter
region. A human placental genomic library was screened with an IRF-1 cDNA probe, 
and two clones that contained the IRF-1 gene and its 5' regulatory region were
obtained. We used these clones to determine the complete nucleotide sequence for 
the IRF-1 gene, finding that the IRF-1 gene spanned 7.72 kb of DNA and included
10 exons and 9 introns. When the deduced amino acid sequences were compared among
different species, the most conserved exons were exons 2, 3, and 4, in which the 
putative DNA binding domain for the IRF-1 protein is located.

Interferon is a key substance of the cytokine network, and is functioning not
only as the virus inhibitory factor, but also as the factor for differentiation, 
development, and homeostasis of animals, including man. The molecular structure, 
induction mechanisms, interaction with receptor, and antiviral action mechanisms 
of IFN were reviewed. 1. Molecular structure of IFN IFNs are now divided into 4
types--alpha, beta, gamma, omega--according to antigenicities of IFN proteins,
and to base sequence of their genes. The omega type was established officially on
1990 by the Nomenclature Committee of International Society for Interferon
Research (ISIR). Also, the genes for HuIFNs were named as follows; HuIFN-A for
HuIFN-alpha, HuIFN-B for HuIFN-beta, HuIFN-G for HuIFN-gamma, and HuIFN-W for
HuIFN-omega. Nevertheless, the names of Type I IFN and Type II IFN are still
valuable, since members of Type I IFN, alpha, beta, and omega, are similar in
their molecular structures, and they share the common receptor (Type I IFN
receptor), on the other hand, HuIFN-gamma (the only one member of Type II IFN)
has different characteristics from the other IFNs, and binds to its specific
receptor (Type II IFN receptor). However, it has been reported that both
N-terminal and C-terminal of IFN protein of all types, participate in the binding
of IFN to its receptor. 2. Induction mechanism of IFN. The factors, IRF-1 and

Constitutive expression of an ISGF2/IRF1 transgene leads to
interferon-independent activation of interferon-inducible genes and resistance to
virus infection.

Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene factor 2 (ISGF2) plays a role in transcription
of the beta IFN (IFN-beta) gene and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and may function 
as a central mediator of cytokine responses. Constitutive ISGF2 transgene
expression resulted in substantial resistance to three RNA virus families. This
phenotype was not a consequence of IFN production and may have arisen directly
through ISG expression. ISGF2 acted generally as a positive transcription factor 
through binding sites from several genes, in the context of transient
cotransfection. Constitutive transcription of the endogenous IFN-beta gene, and
several genes that are normally induced by either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, or only
by IFN-alpha, was elevated in cells that constitutively express an ISGF2
transgene. However, constitutive and virus-induced levels of IFN-beta mRNA were
unaffected in such cell lines.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 is inducible by prolactin, interleukin-2 and

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene expression is rapidly upregulated in 
the prolactin (PRL)-activated Nb2 rat T lymphoma cell line. To further elucidate 
its role as a T cell activation molecule, IRF-1 gene expression in response to
various T cell stimuli was examined. In Nb2 T cells, PRL induced two peaks of
IRF-1 gene expression: a rapid, transient peak at 1 h and a sustained peak at 12 
h. PRL subsequently induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) gene expression at 3-6
h. However, the early induction of IRF-1 and IFN-gamma does not appear to be
interdependent. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) also induced IRF-1 gene expression in Nb2 T 
cells but only one broad peak at 10 h was observed. In primary mouse splenocytes,
concanavalin A induced rapid and transient expression of the IRF-1 gene; maximal 
expression occurred by 6 h, and then returned to basal levels by 12-15 h. These
results provide additional evidence for the importance of IRF-1 in T cell
activation.

(IFN-alpha 4), but not IFN-alpha 6. The integrity of a symmetrical sequence,
GTAAAGAAAGT (alpha F1 site); (-103 to -93), present in the 35 nucleotide (nt)
long inducible element (IE) (-109 to -75) of the alpha 4 promoter region is
essential for the virus-induced expression. In the present study, we have shown
that the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) can induce expression of both
IFN-alpha 4 and -alpha 6 in a transient expression assay. Virus infection
cooperates with IRF-1 and further enhances transcription from the alpha 4
promoter, but inhibits the IRF-1-mediated expression from the alpha 6 promoter.
The virus-mediated induction is determined by both IRF-1 and alpha F1 sites,
while activation by IRF-1 in a cotransfection assay is not greatly influenced by 
the alpha F1 sequence. The activation of IFN-alpha gene promoters by IRF-1 was
limited to the transient expression assay. The integrated alpha 4 promoter or the
endogenous IFN-alpha genes could not be induced by transfection with IRF-1
expressing plasmid and IRF-1 did not up-regulate expression of the endogenous
IRF-1 gene. However, expression of IRF-1 alone was sufficient to up-regulate the 
expression of two IFN stimulated genes, 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and
interferon stimulated (ISG)-15 gene. These results suggest that induction of
IFN-alpha gene expression by virus infection requires cooperation between IRF-1
and another factor(s) that binds to the alpha F1 sequence.

Identification of novel factors that bind to the PRD I region of the human
beta-interferon promoter.

Treatment of cells with virus or synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) leads to
the transient transcriptional activation of the beta-interferon gene. Genetic
analysis has revealed that the 5' regulatory sequence responsible for this
induction contains multiple positive and negative elements. One of these,
Positive Regulatory Domain I (PRD I), has been shown to bind the
positively-acting transcription factor IRF-1. In this study we show that this
element is inducible under conditions where IRF-1 cannot be detected, suggesting 
that additional cellular factors are involved in the induction process. To
investigate the existence of such factors we have analysed the range and
properties of PRD I-binding activities present in HeLa cells. In addition to the 
repressor protein IRF-2, several novel factors can bind to PRD I in uninduced
cells: two of these have properties consistent with a role in negative
regulation; levels of two others increase upon priming, and may be alternative
candidates for activators. Upon induction we also observe a novel factor whose
appearance does not depend upon de novo protein synthesis, and which appears to
be a truncated form of IRF-2. The potential involvement of these factors in
regulating the beta-interferon gene is discussed.

Increased levels of interferon regulatory element-binding activities in nuclei of
high interferon-producing If-1h mice.

(1)Institut du cancer de Montréal, Québec, Canada.

The transient induction of type I interferon (IFN) genes following a viral
infection involves transcriptional derepression and activation, mediated by
positive and negative factors which bind to upstream cis-acting elements. We have
transfected the human IFN-beta gene into primary splenocytes from mice regulated 
by the If-1 locus and have shown that the exogenous gene is regulated by this
locus in a manner similar to that of endogenous IFN genes. Using nuclear extracts
from splenocytes of C57BL/6 (If-1h) and BALB/c (If-1l) mice in gel retardation
assays, we found that levels of DNA-binding activities for the interferon
regulatory element and its subelements were constitutive in nuclear extracts of
spleen cells. Levels of DNA binding to the interferon regulatory element were
higher in extracts from the nuclei of If-1h mice and thus correlate with the
higher levels of human IFN-beta mRNA detected in these transfected cells and the 
transcription of the endogenous IFN genes. Higher levels of
DNA-binding/transcription factors found in nuclei from spleen cells of If-1h mice
may be involved in the expression of the If-1 phenotype.

Differential response of human interferon-beta promoter elements to
trans-activation by HSV VP16 and IRF-1.

The trans-activation potential of herpes simplex virus (HSV) VP16, either alone
or in combination with interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), was examined using
hybrid promoters containing different regulatory elements from the
interferon-beta promoter. Coexpression of HSV VP16 and IRF-1 differentially
activated the AAGTGA hexamer construct Th(2), the AAAGGA hexamer Thm(2)
construct, and the natural IFN-beta promoter. Surprisingly, high concentrations
of IRF-1 inhibited expression of the PRDII containing reporter P2(1)/CAT. These
results indicate that trans-activation by HSV VP16, acting through distinct
cellular transcription factors, may be involved in stimulation of IFN-beta
regulatory domains.

We have investigated the role of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), an
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) inducible transcriptional activator, on major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene transcription. IRF-1 alone is
sufficient to trans-activate both transfected and endogenous class I genes and
the effect of IRF-1 appears to be direct and sequence-specific. These data
suggest that IRF-1 is involved in the IFN-gamma mediated induction of MHC class I
expression.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a protein that binds to cis-elements
within the promoter of interferon (IFN)-beta and some IFN-inducible genes. We
used a human fibroblast line, GM-637, to generate stable transfectants
constitutively expressing IRF-1 mRNA in either the sense or antisense
orientation. Upon induction with poly-(I).poly(C) or Newcastle disease virus,
cells expressing sense IRF-1 mRNA produced significantly higher levels of
IFN-beta mRNA and protein than control cells, whereas cells expressing antisense 
IRF-1 mRNA produced little or no IFN-beta mRNA and protein. Furthermore, clear
differences were seen among the transfectants in the level of expression of two
IFN-induced genes (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and class I HLA). Our data
show that IRF-1 is essential for the induced expression of the IFN-beta gene. The
results also indicate an important role of IRF-1 in the expression of
IFN-inducible genes and suggest a role for IRF-1 in many other cytokine actions.

Activation of IFN-beta element by IRF-1 requires a posttranslational event in
addition to IRF-1 synthesis.

Expression of the Type I IFN (i.e., IFN-alpha s and IFN-beta) genes is
efficiently induced by viruses at the transcriptional level. This induction is
mediated by at least two types of positive regulatory elements located in the
human IFN-beta gene promoter: (1) the repeated elements which bind both the
transcriptional activator IRF-1 and the repressor IRF-2 (IRF-elements; IRF-Es),
and (2) the kappa B element (kappa B-E), which binds NF kappa B and is located
between the IRF-Es and the TATA box. In this study we demonstrate that a promoter
containing synthetic IRF-E, which displays high affinity for the IRFs can be
efficiently activated by Newcastle disease virus (NDV). In contrast, such
activation was either very weak or nil when cells were treated by IFN-beta or
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), despite the fact they both efficiently
induce de novo synthesis of the short-lived IRF-1 in L929 cells. In fact,
efficient activation of the IRF-E apparently requires an event in addition to de 
novo IRF-1 induction, which can be elicited by NDV even in the presence of
protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Moreover, efficient activation of the
IRF-E by NDV is specifically inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor,
Staurosporin. Hence our results suggest the importance of IRF-1 synthesis and
post-translational modification event(s), possibly phosphorylation for the
efficient activation of IRF-Es, which are otherwise under negative regulation by 
IRF-2.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 is a myeloid differentiation primary response gene
induced by interleukin 6 and leukemia inhibitory factor: role in growth
inhibition.

of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.

To better understand the immediate early genetic response of myeloid cells to
terminal differentiation and growth inhibitory stimuli, we have recently isolated
complementary DNA clones of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes,
activated in the absence of protein synthesis in M1 myeloid precursor cells
following induction for terminal differentiation and growth arrest by conditioned
media of mouse lungs, a potent physiological source of hemopoietic
differentiation inducers. In this study, it is shown that one particular MyD
complementary DNA clone, expressed highly in normal precursor enriched bone
marrow cells, encodes for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a positive
transcription factor for expression of the beta-interferon (IFN-beta) gene. Using
a clone of M1 cells inducible for terminal differentiation by both interleukin 6 
(IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), two multifunctional cytokines
recently identified as physiological inducers of hemopoietic cell
differentiation, it has been shown that IRF-1 expression is rapidly induced by
IL-6 and LIF in the absence of protein synthesis and is followed by a later
increase in the levels of IFN-beta mRNA, observed to be largely dependent on
protein synthesis. Also, it is shown that the growth inhibition associated with
IL-6 or LIF induced terminal differentiation could be partially abrogated via the
use of IRF-1 antisense oligomers or IFN-beta antiserum. Taken together, these
findings imply a regulatory cascade, where induction of terminal myeloid
differentiation by IL-6 or LIF triggers the immediate early activation of IRF-1, 
leading to the later induction of IFN-beta, in turn playing an autocrine role in 
growth inhibition.

It has been shown that a nuclear factor, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1),
plays a key role in the regulation of the type I interferon (IFN) system by
affecting the transcription of type I IFN and some IFN-inducible genes. In this
study, the human IRF1 gene was mapped to chromosome 5 by analysis of mouse-human 
somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, by linkage analysis based on RFLP (restriction
fragment length polymorphism), the gene was localized to chromosome 5q23-q31, the
region that has been termed "critical" for some myeloid disorders.

Extracellular signals regulate gene expression by triggering signal transduction 
cascades that result in the modulation of transcription factor activity. This is 
most commonly achieved by changes in the phosphorylation state of these nuclear
proteins. Phosphorylation affects transcription factor activity at several
distinct levels. It can modulate their intracellular localization by controlling 
the association with other proteins, have both negative and positive effects on
their DNA-binding activity, and modulate the activity of their transcriptional
activation domains. In addition to phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions 
also have an important role in mediating a crosstalk at the nuclear level between
different signalling pathways.

Interferon (IFNs), as a class of antiviral cytokines, are also known as "negative
growth regulators," they inhibit the growth of a variety of normal and malignant 
cells. Normally, Type I IFNs (i.e. IFN-alpha, -beta) are not induced, but viruses
and a number of other cytokines transiently activate the IFN genes. In order to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cellular responses by viruses and
cytokines, we have identified two nuclear factors, IRF-1 and IRF-2, both bind to 
the regulatory cis-elements of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. The genes encoding
IRF-1 and IRF-2, have been cloned and extensively characterized. The IRF cDNA
expression studies in factor-negative cells have revealed IRF-1 and IRF-2 to
function as transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively. In normal
cells, the IRF genes are subject to induction through stimuli such as viruses and
cytokines including IFNs per se. The findings provide evidence for the presence
of an elaborate network of cytokines system wherein the IRFs play a crucial role 
for the cytokine-mediated cellular responses.

A syndrome characterized by severe immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferation
develops in susceptible strains of mice infected with a mixture of murine
leukemia viruses (MuLVs) designated LP-BM5 MuLV. The etiologic agent in this
mixture has been shown to be a replication-defective virus (BM5d) with a 4.8-kb
genome that required replication-competent helper viruses, primarily ecotropic
(BM5e), for cell-to-cell spread in the host. In the present study, we studied the
expression of BM5d and BM5e in tissues of infected mice at various times after
inoculation in relation to the expression of cytokine genes that may contribute
to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Northern (RNA) analysis of total RNA showed
that BM5d was expressed at significant levels in lymphoid tissues within 1 week
of infection and that the levels of expression increased with time after
inoculation. By 16 weeks postinfection, BM5d was expressed in all tissues
examined. Expression of BM5e was relatively more restricted to lymphoid tissues
and was detected at lower levels than expression of BM5d at early times after
infection, but this virus was expressed in all tissues by 16 weeks. Infection
with the virus mixture was associated with constitutive expression of tumor
necrosis factor in all tissues examined and of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in lymphoid
tissues within 1 week of infection, and at later times with widespread expression
of these cytokines and gamma interferon. Also, the levels of interferon
regulatory factor 1 mRNA were significantly increased in all infected tissues
during the infection. In contrast, expression of IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 was
not detectable by Northern analysis of the respective mRNAs in any infected
tissue at early or late times postinfection.

Interferons (IFNs) are well known both as antiviral proteins and as potent
regulators of cell growth and differentiation. In fact, IFNs inhibit growth of
various normal and transformed cell types. Previously, a nuclear factor, IRF-1
(interferon regulatory factor 1), which binds to type I IFN and some
IFN-inducible gene promoters, was identified and cloned. Since the IRF-1 gene is 
both virus and IFN inducible, an intriguing issue is raised as to whether the
IRF-1 gene is functioning in IFN-mediated regulation of cell growth and
differentiation. In this study, we generated transgenic mice carrying the human
IRF-1 gene linked to the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer. In the
transgenic mice, all the lymphoid tissues examined showed a dramatic reduction in
the number of B lymphocytes (B cells). Preparation and analysis of bone marrow
cells from the chimeric mice indicated that the bone marrow is the effective site
for specific depletion of the B-cell population. In fact, transgenic bone marrow 
cells cocultured with a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line revealed an altered
B-cell maturation pattern.

Mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) develop a syndrome denoted
as murine AIDS. Macrophages harvested from the peritoneal cavities of these mice 
at 4 or 9 wk postinoculation with LP-BM5 MuLV were analyzed by Northern
hybridization for the presence of the defective LP-BM5 virus and their ability to
synthesize various cytokines upon induction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or
(LPS). Neither IFN-alpha or IFN-beta was found to be constitutively expressed in 
LP-BM5-infected macrophages and in NDV induction studies, and the levels of
biologically active IFN-alpha and its mRNA were found to be lower in LP-BM5
MuLV-infected macrophages than in the macrophages from uninfected controls.
Similarly, after NDV or LPS induction, the levels of TNF mRNA and TNF protein
were significantly lower in LP-BM5-infected macrophages than in macrophages from 
uninfected mice. The LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages constitutively expressed
low levels of IL-1 beta, and when induced with LPS, the relative levels of IL-1
beta were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected macrophages.
Although no constitutive expression of IL-6 was detected, the levels of IL-6 mRNA
induced with NDV were higher in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in
controls. Thus, we found alterations in the expression of selected cytokines in
macrophages from mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV rather than a general
deregulation of all cytokine expression. These results show that macrophages
infected with the defective LP-BM5 virus respond differently to NDV- or
LPS-stimulation and suggest that aberrant expression of certain cytokine genes
may play a role in the immunopathologic condition in mice with murine AIDS.

Absence of the type I IFN system in EC cells: transcriptional activator (IRF-1)

Interferons (IFNs) are a heterogeneous family of cytokines that exhibits multiple
biological activities. Upon viral infection, expression of type I IFNs (i.e.,
IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) is induced in a variety of differentiated cells but not
in cells of embryonal origin. IRF-1 and IRF-2, which bind to the same
cis-elements within the promoters of type I IFN and IFN-inducible MHC class I
genes, were identified previously. Here we demonstrate that the expression of
both IRF and IFN genes is developmentally regulated in mouse EC cells; these
genes become functional only after cell differentiation. Furthermore,
cDNA-directed IRF-1 produced in undifferentiated but not differentiated EC cells 
efficiently activates the transfected IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and endogenous
IFN-alpha genes, whereas IRF-2 represses the IRF-1 effects. These findings
emphasize the dual function of the IRF-responsive cis-elements as positive and
negative regulators, since they can be occupied by transcriptionally active or
inactive IRF molecules. This type of regulatory mechanism might operate in other 
cytokine systems.

Synergism between distinct enhanson domains in viral induction of the human beta

General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

This study demonstrates distinct virus-inducible enhanson properties for three
regions of the human beta interferon (IFN-beta) promoter; maximum virus
inducibility required syngerism among all three enhansons. Expression of the
IRF-1 transcription factor differentially increased the expression of plasmids
containing (AAGTGA)4 or PRDIII (-94 to -78) motifs but was inefficient in the
induction of the intact IFN-beta promoter. The human T-cell lymphotropic virus
type I Tax protein was a strong positive activator of PRDII (-64 to
-55)-containing plasmids but was also unable to stimulate the IFN-beta promoter. 
Induction of the intact IFN-beta promoter linked to a reporter plasmid was
achieved in lymphoid and epithelioid cellular backgrounds by a triple
transfection with IRF-1 and Tax expression plasmids or a combination of IRF-1 and
phorbol ester, indicating that at least two trans-activating events and the
association of two proteins on the promoter template are required for IFN-beta
activation.

Interferon-regulatory factor 1 is an immediate-early gene under transcriptional
regulation by prolactin in Nb2 T cells.

Yu-Lee LY(1), Hrachovy JA, Stevens AM, Schwarz LA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.

The pituitary peptide hormone prolactin (Prl) is a potent inducer of Nb2 T
lymphoma cell proliferation. To analyze the early genetic response to the
mitogenic signals of Prl, a cDNA library was constructed from Nb2 T cells
stimulated for 4 h with Prl and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Of
26 distinct clones isolated by differential screening, one clone, designated c25,
exhibited extremely rapid but transient kinetics of induction by Prl and
superinduction by Prl plus cycloheximide. Run-on transcription analysis indicated
that c25 gene transcription was induced greater than 20-fold within 30 to 60 min 
of Prl stimulation. Surprisingly, DNA sequence analysis of c25 cDNA revealed that
this Prl-inducible early-response gene is the rat homolog of the mouse
transcription factor interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), sharing 91% coding
sequence similarity with mouse IRF-1. At the protein level, rat IRF-1 shares 97% 
and 92% homology with mouse IRF-1 and human IRF-1, respectively, suggesting that 
this molecule has been functionally conserved throughout evolution. Our studies
show that the gene for IRF-1 is an immediate-early gene in Prl-stimulated T
cells, which suggests that IRF-1 is a multifunctional molecule. In addition to
its role in regulating growth-inhibitory interferon genes, IRF-1 may, therefore, 
also play a stimulatory role in cell proliferation. The gene for IRF-1 is one of 
the earliest genes known to be transcriptionally regulated by Prl.

Purification and cloning of interferon-stimulated gene factor 2 (ISGF2): ISGF2
(IRF-1) can bind to the promoters of both beta interferon- and
interferon-stimulated genes but is not a primary transcriptional activator of
either.

York 10021.

Interferon-stimulated gene factor 2 (ISGF2) was purified from HeLa cells treated 
with alpha interferon. The factor, a single polypeptide of 56 kilodaltons (kDa), 
bound both to the central 9 base pairs of the 15-base-pair interferon-stimulated 
response element (ISRE) that is required for transcriptional activation of
interferon-stimulated genes and to the PRD-I regulatory element of the beta
interferon gene. ISGF2 was a phosphoprotein, and dephosphorylation in vitro
reduced its DNA-binding activity. However, conditions that changed the amount of 
ISGF2 did not change the phosphorylated isoforms in vivo. ISGF2 in unstimulated
cells existed in trace amounts and was induced by both alpha interferon and gamma
interferon as well as by virus infection. Plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli clones
encoding ISGF2 were selected with antibody against purified ISGF2. Sequence
analysis revealed that the ISGF2 protein was the same as that encoded by the cDNA
clone IRF-1, which has been claimed to activate transcription of interferon
genes. We show that transcription of the ISGF2 gene was induced by alpha
interferon, gamma interferon, and double-stranded RNA. However, ISGF2 was neither
necessary nor sufficient for induced transcription of the beta interferon gene,
while the factor NF kappa B was clearly involved.

cytokines and activators of second-messenger pathways.

Nuclear protein IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) was earlier shown to bind 
to cis-acting regulatory elements present on interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta genes
and some IFN-inducible genes. Here we show that in both human FS-4 and murine
L929 cells, steady-state levels of IRF-1 mRNA were increased by treatment with
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), poly(I).poly(C), or IFN-beta. 
IRF-1 mRNA induction was also demonstrated in cells treated with calcium
ionophore A23187 or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not with epidermal 
growth factor, dibutyryl-cAMP, or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. To
determine whether stimulation of IRF-1 mRNA levels correlates with IFN-beta
induction, we compared IRF-1 and IFN-beta mRNA levels in cells exposed to various
stimuli. In L929 cells, treatment with poly(I).poly(C) under conditions that
failed to induce significant levels of IFN-beta mRNA led to a very low induction 
of IRF-1 mRNA, but "priming" cells with IFN prior to the addition of
poly(I).poly(C) greatly increased both IRF-1 and IFN-beta mRNAs. In FS-4 cells an
increase in IFN-beta mRNA (examined by the polymerase chain reaction) was seen
after treatment with TNF, IL-1, A23187, or poly(I).poly(C), but not with
IFN-beta, epidermal growth factor, dibutyryl-cAMP, or forskolin. Thus, all
treatments that increased steady-state levels of IFN-beta mRNA also enhanced
IRF-1 mRNA levels. However, treatment with IFN-beta, which caused a marked
stimulation in IRF-1 mRNA, failed to produce a detectable increase in IFN-beta
mRNA. It appears that IRF-1 may be necessary but not sufficient for IFN-beta
induction. The ability of TNF and IL-1 to increase both IRF-1 and IFN-beta mRNAs 
may be responsible for some similarities in the actions of TNF, IL-1, and the
IFNs.

Viral infections commonly induce expression of type I interferon (IFN) genes. The
induction is transient and involves transcriptional activation wherein a positive
factor, IRF-1, binds to upstream regulatory cis elements. In the present study we
report the isolation of a cDNA encoding a novel factor, termed IRF-2, that
interacts with the same nucleotide sequence elements as IRF-1. Both genes are
inducible not only by virus but also by IFN. Unlike IRF-1, IRF-2 does not
function as an activator; rather, it suppresses the function of IRF-1 under
certain circumstances. Our results suggest that transcription of the IFN and
IFN-inducible genes is regulated by two similar trans-acting factors that
apparently compete for the same cis-acting recognition sequences, but which have 
opposite effects.
