Epidemiological studies suggest a strong contribution of genetic factors in the
pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the last decades, many
risk loci have been identified in several genetic association studies following
both candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. The present work was conducted by
GAPAID (Genes And Proteins for AutoImmunity Diagnostics) consortium with a dual
aim: to replicate the association of several previously reported SLE
susceptibility loci in an independent European sample and to explore their
relation with some disease subphenotypes. A total of 48 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) from 40 associated loci were typed in a cohort of 208 SLE
patients and 152 controls from Rheumatology Units of the University Hospital of
Pisa (Italy) and University of Pécs Medical Center (Hungary). Regression analyses
were performed to detect disease susceptibility loci and to identify genes
affecting specific disease manifestations (renal, neurological, or skin
involvement; arthritis; secondary Sjögren syndrome; and secondary
antiphospholipid syndrome). Association of previously described risk alleles from
HLA locus has been replicated, while IRF5, BLK, ITGAM, and IRF8 loci have been
found to be consistent with previous published results. In addition, two new
subphenotype-specific associations have been detected: SNP rs5754217 (UBE2L3)
with skin involvement and rs3093030 (ICAM1-ICAM4-ICAM5) with hematological
disorders. Overall, results from GAPAID project are consistent with previously
established associations for HLA, IRF5, BLK, ITGAM, and IRF8 SLE susceptibility
loci and report for the first time two subphenotype-specific associations.

Oral tolerance prevents pathological inflammatory responses to innocuous foreign 
antigens by peripheral regulatory T cells (pTreg cells). However, whether a
particular subset of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is required during dietary
antigen exposure for the 'instruction' of naive CD4(+) T cells to differentiate
into pTreg cells has not been defined. Using myeloid lineage-specific APC
depletion in mice, we found that monocyte-derived APCs were dispensable, while
classical dendritic cells (cDCs) were critical, for pTreg cell induction and oral
tolerance. CD11b(-) cDCs from the gut-draining lymph nodes efficiently induced
pTreg cells and, conversely, loss of transcription factor IRF8-dependent CD11b(-)
cDCs impaired their polarization, although oral tolerance remained intact. These 
data reveal the hierarchy of cDC subsets in the induction of pTreg cells and
their redundancy during the development of oral tolerance.

Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare syndrome
characterized by severe clinical infections usually caused by weakly virulent
mycobacterial species such as Bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) vaccines and
environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria or more virulent mycobacteria as
mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since 1996, Nine genes including 7 autosomal (STAT1, 
IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL12B, IL12RB1, ISG15 and IRF8) and two X-linked genes (NEMO and 
CYBB) have been identified. Allelic heterogeneity leaded to recognize about
eighteen genetic diseases with variable clinical phenotypes, but sharing a same
physiological mechanism represented by a defect in human IL-12-dependant INF-<U+03B3>
mediated immunity. We report here a case of multifocal BCG osteomyelitis in a
context Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease mimicking a metastatic 
neuroblastoma in a child presenting with delayed growth. The investigation of her
twin sister showed the same disease. A heterozygous mutation in exon 22 of STAT 1
gene was found in both sisters, another sister and the father being healthy and
heterozygous for the same mutation.

IRF8 and IRF1 are transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in the
development and function of myeloid cells, including activation of macrophages by
proinflammatory signals such as interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>). Loss of IRF8 or IRF1
function causes severe susceptibility to infections in mice and in humans. We
used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing in wild type and
in IRF8 and IRF1 mutant primary macrophages to systematically catalog all of the 
genes bound by (cistromes) and transcriptionally activated by (regulomes) IRF8,
IRF1, PU.1, and STAT1, including modulation of epigenetic histone marks. Of the
seven binding combinations identified, two (cluster 1 [IRF8/IRF1/STAT1/PU.1] and 
cluster 5 [IRF1/STAT1/PU.1]) were found to have a major role in controlling
macrophage transcriptional programs both at the basal level and after IFN-<U+03B3>
activation. They direct the expression of a set of genes, the IRF8/IRF1 regulome,
that play critical roles in host inflammatory and antimicrobial defenses in mouse
models of neuroinflammation and of pulmonary tuberculosis, respectively. In
addition, this IRF8/IRF1 regulome is enriched for genes mutated in human primary 
immunodeficiencies and with loci associated with several inflammatory diseases in
humans.

Basophils and mast cells play important roles in host defense against parasitic
infections and allergic responses. Several progenitor populations, either shared 
or specific, for basophils and/or mast cells have been identified, thus
elucidating the developmental pathways of these cells. Multiple transcription
factors essential for their development and the relationships between them have
been also revealed. For example, IRF8 induces GATA2 expression to promote the
generation of both basophils and mast cells. The STAT5-GATA2 axis induces C/EBPa 
and MITF expression, facilitating the differentiation into basophils and mast
cells, respectively. In addition, C/EBPa and MITF mutually suppress each other's 
expression. This review provides an overview of recent advances in our
understanding of how transcription factors regulate the development of basophils 
and mast cells.

BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) -mediated immunity underlie
disseminated disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
live vaccines. We hypothesized that some patients with osteitis after BCG
vaccination may have an impaired IFN-<U+03B3> immunity. Our aim was to investigate IL-12
and IFN-<U+03B3> ex-vivo production stimulated with BCG and BCG+IFN-<U+03B3> or BCG+IL-12,
respectively, in BCG osteitis survivors.
METHODS: Fresh blood samples were collected from 132 former BCG osteitis Finnish 
patients now aged 21-49 years, and IL-12 and IFN-<U+03B3> were measured in cell cultures
with and without stimulation with BCG and with BCG+IFN-<U+03B3> or BCG+IL-12,
respectively. As a pilot study, known disease-causing genes controlling IFN-<U+03B3>
immunity (IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1, IL12B, IL12RB1, ISG15, IRF8, NEMO and CYBB) were
investigated in 20 selected patients by whole-exome -sequencing.
RESULTS: By the limit of <5 percentile, ex-vivo IL-12 concentration and increase 
in concentration was low in five, and ex-vivo IFN-<U+03B3> concentration and increase in
concentration was low in six patients (including two samples with both IL-12 and 
IFN-<U+03B3> findings). By the limit of <10 percentile, an additional six and four
patients were respectively detected (including two samples with both findings).
With two exceptions, low concentrations and low increases in concentrations
picked-up the same cases. Mutations in known disease-causing IFN-<U+03B3>-related genes 
were not found in any of these patients.
CONCLUSION: These findings call for searching of mutations in new genes governing
IFN-<U+03B3>-dependent immunity to live BCG vaccine.

The Ets family transcription factor PU.1 and the interferon regulatory factor
(IRF)4 and IRF8 regulate gene expression by binding to composite DNA sequences
known as Ets/interferon consensus elements. Although all three factors are
expressed from the onset of B-cell development, single deficiency of these
factors in B-cell progenitors only mildly impacts on bone marrow B lymphopoiesis.
Here we tested whether PU.1 cooperates with IRF factors in regulating early
B-cell development. Lack of PU.1 and IRF4 resulted in a partial block in
development the pre-B-cell stage. The combined deletion of PU.1 and IRF8 reduced 
recirculating B-cell numbers. Strikingly, all PU.1/IRF4 and ~50% of PU.1/IRF8
double deficient mice developed pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
associated with reduced expression of the established B-lineage tumor suppressor 
genes, Ikaros and Spi-B. These genes are directly regulated by PU.1/IRF4/IRF8,
and restoration of Ikaros or Spi-B expression inhibited leukemic cell growth. In 
summary, we demonstrate that PU.1, IRF4 and IRF8 cooperate to regulate early
B-cell development and to prevent pre-B-ALL formation.Leukemia advance online

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is expressed in many types of blood cells and
plays critical roles in cellular differentiation and function. However, the role 
of IRF8 in nonhematopoietic systems remains poorly understood. In this study, we 
provide evidence that IRF8 is a transcriptional modulator of the gastric mucosa
necessary for limiting Helicobacter pylori colonization. H. pylori infection
significantly upregulated expression of IRF8, which, in turn, promoted IFN-<U+03B3>
expression by gastric epithelial cells. Mice deficient in IRF8 exhibited
increased H. pylori colonization and aborted induction of mucosal IFN-<U+03B3>.
Genome-wide analyses of IFN-<U+03B3>-treated gastric epithelial cells by chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing led to the identification of
IRF8 target genes, with many belonging to the IFN-regulated gene family that was 
observed previously in immune cells. Our results identify the IRF8-IFN-<U+03B3> circuit 
as a novel gastric innate immune mechanism in the host defense against infection 
with H. pylori.

Several modulatory factors in the TLR signaling pathway including IRF3, IRF7,
IRF8, TRIM20, MYD88 and NF-<U+03BA>B1 have been associated with autoimmune disease. In
this study, we investigated the association of 13 SNPs for these genes with
Behçet's disease (BD) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome using a polymerase 
chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.
Haplotype and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis were performed by
Haploview4.2. IRF8 mRNA expression and cytokine production was tested by
real-time PCR and ELISA. Two SNPs near IRF8 were associated with BD (for
rs17445836 GG genotype, Pc<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.56<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-8), OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.044; for rs11642873 AA
genotype, Pc<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.24<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-7), OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.776). No significant association was found
for the 13 SNPs tested with VKH syndrome. Haplotype analysis of the two positive 
SNPs revealed that the AG haplotype was significantly increased in BD patients
(Pc<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.60<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-8), OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.646). Functional studies revealed an increased mRNA
expression of IRF8 and IFN-<U+03B3> production and a decreased production of IL-10 in
rs17445836 carriers with the GG genotype. Increased expression of IRF8 as well as
IFN-<U+03B3> production and a decreased production of IL-10 were found in individuals
carrying the rs11642873/AA genotype. In conclusion, this study indicates that
IRF8 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of BD by regulating IRF8
expression and cytokine production.

Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides that can down-regulate cellular elements of the
immune system have been developed and are being widely studied in preclinical
models. These agents vary in sequence, mechanism of action, and cellular
target(s) but share the ability to suppress a plethora of inflammatory responses.
This work reviews the types of immunosuppressive oligodeoxynucleotide (Sup ODN)
and compares their therapeutic activity against diseases characterized by
pathologic levels of immune stimulation ranging from autoimmunity to septic shock
to cancer (see graphical abstract). The mechanism(s) underlying the efficacy of
Sup ODN and the influence size, sequence and nucleotide backbone on function are

Tibetan Plateau (TP) had experienced phased uplift, resulting in inhospitable
environment of low temperature, hypoxia and high ultraviolet radiation for
Tibetan wildlife. Many organisms can well adapt to TP, it is of ecological and
evolutionary interest to untangle how organisms adapt to extreme environment on
TP through evolution. Previous studies mainly focused on hypoxia and metabolism
related genes, but we know little about the evolutionary history of immune genes 
in Tibetan wildlife. In this study, we first identified 10 interferon regulatory 
factor (IRF) genes from Tibetan naked carp Gymnocypris przewalskii. Within this
gene family, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7 and IRF8 contained positive selection sites.
Evidences indicated that positive selection may lead to IRF genes functional
alternations, presumably driving genes towards adaptation to the environmental
changes. Taken together, our results suggested 4 candidate genes as interesting
targets for further experimental confirmation of their functional variations and 
contributions to high altitude adaptation in Tibet fish.

IRF4 and IRF8 Act in CD11c+ Cells To Regulate Terminal Differentiation of Lung
Tissue Dendritic Cells.

Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate immune responses in barrier tissues including lung
and skin. Conventional DC (cDC) subsets, CD11b(-) (cDC1s) or CD11b(+) (cDC2s),
arise via distinct networks of transcription factors involving IFN regulatory
factor 4 (IRF4) and IRF8, and are specialized for unique functional responses.
Using mice in which a conditional Irf4 or Irf8 allele is deleted in CD11c(+)
cells, we determined whether IRF4 or IRF8 deficiency beginning in CD11c(+) cDC
precursors (pre-cDCs) changed the homeostasis of mature DCs or pre-DCs in the
lung, dermis, and spleen. CD11c-cre-Irf4(-/-) mice selectively lacked a
lung-resident CD11c(hi)CD11b(+)SIRPa(+)CD24(+) DC subset, but not other lung
CD11b(+) DCs or alveolar macrophages. Numbers of CD11b(+)CD4(+) splenic DCs, but 
not CD11b(+) dermal DCs, were reduced, indicating cDC2s in the lung and dermis
develop via different pathways. Irf4 deficiency did not alter numbers of cDC1s.
CD11c-cre-Irf8(-/-) mice lacked lung-resident CD103(+) DCs and splenic CD8a(+)
DCs, yet harbored increased IRF4-dependent DCs. This correlated with a reduced
number of Irf8(-/-) pre-cDCs, which contained elevated IRF4, suggesting that Irf8
deficiency diverts pre-cDC fate. Analyses of Irf4 and Irf8 haploinsufficient mice
showed that, although one Irf4 allele was sufficient for lung cDC2 development,
two functional Irf8 alleles were required for differentiation of lung cDC1s.
Thus, IRF8 and IRF4 act in pre-cDCs to direct the terminal differentiation of
cDC1 and cDC2 subsets in the lung and spleen. These data suggest that variation
in IRF4 or IRF8 levels resulting from genetic polymorphisms or environmental cues
will govern tissue DC numbers and, therefore, regulate the magnitude of DC
functional responses.

The Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) family consists of multiple transcription 
factors involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes.
Originally identified as transcriptional regulators of the type I interferon
system, IRFs play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, cell growth,
differentiation and tumorigenesis. Hence, understanding IRF biology has important
implications in the host response to cancer development and progression. Many
lines of evidence suggest that different IRFs are involved in the pathogenesis of
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder caused by the
BCR-ABL oncoprotein. BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that 
favors cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and allows cell survival even in
the absence of proper adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Different BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently available for CML treatment. These drugs
are able to generate eight year CML-specific overall survival rates >90%, only a 
minority of patients will achieve molecular responses compatible with drug
discontinuation. Thus, there is an unmet need for additional therapeutic targets 
that may lead to the cure of most patients diagnosed with CML. A growing body of 
evidence has suggested a role for both IRF4 and IRF8 in the pathogenesis of CML. 
Furthermore, IRF1 is consistently deleted at one or both alleles in patients with
leukemia and myelodysplasia. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that IRF5 is 
a target of BCR-ABL kinase activity and reduces CML cell proliferation. In this
article, we provide an update on the current knowledge of the role of the IRFs in
CML.

Emergency granulopoiesis occurs in response to infectious or inflammatory
challenge and is a component of the innate immune response. Some molecular events
involved in initiating emergency granulopoiesis are known, but termination of
this process is less well defined. In this study, we found that the interferon
consensus sequence binding protein (Icsbp/Irf8) was required to terminate
emergency granulopoiesis. Icsbp is an interferon regulatory transcription factor 
with leukemia suppressor activity. Expression of Icsbp is decreased in chronic
myeloid leukemia, and Icsbp(-/-) mice exhibit progressive granulocytosis with
evolution to blast crisis, similar to the course of human chronic myeloid
leukemia. In this study, we found aberrantly sustained granulocyte production in 
Icsbp(-/-) mice after stimulation of an emergency granulopoiesis response. Icsbp 
represses transcription of the genes encoding Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1)
and growth arrest-specific 2 (Gas2) and activates genes encoding Fanconi C and F.
After stimulation of emergency granulopoiesis, we found increased and sustained
expression of Fap1 and Gas2 in bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells from
Icsbp(-/-) mice in comparison with the wild type. This was associated with
resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis and increased ß-catenin activity in these
cells. We also found that repeated episodes of emergency granulopoiesis
accelerated progression to acute myeloid leukemia in Icsbp(-/-) mice. This was
associated with impaired Fanconi C and F expression and increased sensitivity to 
DNA damage in bone marrow myeloid progenitors. Our results suggest that impaired 
Icsbp expression enhances leukemogenesis by deregulating processes that normally 
limit granulocyte expansion during the innate immune response.

Human monocytes are a heterogeneous cell population classified into three
different subsets: Classical CD14++CD16-, intermediate CD14++CD16+, and
non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes. These subsets are distinguished by their
differential expression of CD14 and CD16, and unique gene expression profile. So 
far, the variation in inter-cellular gene expression within the monocyte subsets 
is largely unknown. In this study, the cellular variation within each human
monocyte subset from a single healthy donor was described by using a novel
single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis tool. We investigated 86 different genes
mainly encoding cell surface markers, and proteins involved in immune regulation.
Within the three human monocyte subsets, our descriptive findings show multimodal
expression of key immune response genes, such as CD40, NF<U+2C6A>B1, RELA, TLR4, TLR8
and TLR9. Furthermore, we discovered one subgroup of cells within the classical
monocytes, which showed alterations of 22 genes e.g. IRF8, CD40, CSF1R, NF<U+2C6A>B1,
RELA and TNF. Additionally one subgroup within the intermediate and non-classical
monocytes also displayed distinct gene signatures by altered expression of 8 and 
6 genes, respectively. Hence the three monocyte subsets can be further subdivided
according to activation status and differentiation, independently of the
traditional classification based on cell surface markers. Demonstrating the use
and the ability to discover cell heterogeneity within defined populations of
human monocytes is of great importance, and can be useful in unravelling
inter-cellular variation in leukocyte populations, identifying subpopulations
involved in disease pathogenesis and help tailor new therapies.

Synthetic oligonucleotides (ODNs) containing CpG motifs stimulate human
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce type-1 interferons (IFNs) and
proinflammatory cytokines. Previous studies demonstrated that interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs) play a central role in mediating CpG-induced pDC
activation. This work explores the inverse effects of IRF5 and IRF8 (also known
as IFN consensus sequence-binding protein) on CpG-dependent gene expression in
the human CAL-1 pDC cell line. This cell line shares many of the phenotypic and
functional properties of freshly isolated human pDCs. Results from RNA
interference and microarray studies indicate that IRF5 upregulates TLR9-driven
gene expression whereas IRF8 downregulates the same genes. Several findings
support the conclusion that IRF8 inhibits TLR9-dependent gene expression by
directly blocking the activity of IRF5. First, the inhibitory activity of IRF8 is
only observed when IRF5 is present. Second, proximity ligation analysis shows
that IRF8 and IRF5 colocalize within the cytoplasm of resting human pDCs and
cotranslocate to the nucleus after CpG stimulation. Taken together, these
findings suggest that IRF5 and IRF8, two transcription factors with opposing
functions, control TLR9 signaling in human pDCs.

Inflammation importantly contributes to the pathophysiology of Cardiovascular
Disease (CVD). Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)1 operates 
at the frontier of innate and adaptive immunity and its involvement in CVD has
been widely appreciated. A unique role of STAT1 in cross-talk between the
pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4 activators (TLR4-A) has been uncovered in
immune as well as vascular cells increasing inflammation. Interferon Regulatory
Factor (IRF)8 whose expression was initially identified in immune cells, controls
development and differentiation in close connection with PU.1. In addition, as a 
STAT1-target, IRF8 accounts for "immune cell-specific" STAT1-dependent functions 
of IFN<U+03B3> and LPS. Novel studies prove that also in endothelial cells (ECs) and
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), STAT1 and IRF8 orchestrate a
transcriptional platform for cross-talk between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4-A, which leads to
amplified pro-atherogenic responses in the vasculature. In addition to its known 
immune cell functions, this points to a novel "inflammation-dependent" role of
IRF8 in vascular cells. In this review we present a summary of these findings and
postulate STAT1- and IRF8-target genes as promising markers of vascular
inflammation, and STAT1 and IRF8 as potential targets for the development of new 
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of CVD.

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome
(pSS) are typically characterized by the presence of autoantibodies and an
IFN-signature. The strength of the IFN-signature positively correlates with
disease severity, suggesting that type I IFNs are active players in these
diseases. BAFF is a cytokine critical for development and proper selection of B
cells, and the targeting of BAFF has emerged as a successful treatment strategy
of SLE. Previous reports have suggested that BAFF expression is directly induced 
by type I IFNs, but the precise mechanism for this remains unknown. In this
article, we demonstrate that BAFF is a bona fide ISG and that IFN regulatory
factors (IRFs) control the expression of BAFF. We identify IRF1 and IRF2 as
positive regulators of BAFF transcription and IRF4 and IRF8 as potent repressors;
in addition, we have mapped the precise binding site for these factors in the
BAFF promoter. IFN-ß injections induced BAFF expression mainly in neutrophils and
monocytes, and BAFF expression in neutrophils from pSS patients strongly
correlated with the strength of the IFN-signature. In summary, we show that BAFF 
expression is directly induced by type I IFNs via IRF1 and IRF2, whereas IRF4 and
IRF8 are negative regulators of BAFF expression. These data suggest that type I
IFN blockade in SLE and pSS patients will lead to downregulation of BAFF and a
consequential reduction of autoreactive B cell clones and autoantibodies.

The IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family encodes transcription factors that play
important roles in immune defense, stress response, reproduction, development,
and carcinogenesis. Although the origin of the IRF family has been dated back to 
multicellular organisms, invertebrate IRFs differ from vertebrate IRFs in genomic
structure and gene synteny, and little is known about their functions. Through
comparison of multiple amphioxus genomes, in this study we suggested that
amphioxus contains nine IRF members, whose orthologs are supposed to be shared
among three amphioxus species. As the orthologs to the vertebrate IRF1 and IRF4
subgroups, Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense (bbt)IRF1 and bbtIRF8 bind the
IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and were upregulated when amphioxus
intestinal cells were stimulated with poly(I:C). As amphioxus-specific IRFs, both
bbtIRF3 and bbtIRF7 bind ISRE. When activated, they can be phosphorylated by
bbtTBK1 and then translocate into nucleus for target gene transcription. As
transcriptional repressors, bbtIRF2 and bbtIRF4 can inhibit the transcriptional
activities of bbtIRF1, 3, 7, and 8 by competing for the binding of ISRE.
Interestingly, amphioxus IRF2, IRF8, and Rel were identified as target genes of
bbtIRF1, bbtIRF7, and bbtIRF3, respectively, suggesting a dynamic feedback
regulation among amphioxus IRF and NF-<U+03BA>B. Collectively, to our knowledge we
present for the first time an archaic IRF signaling framework in a basal
chordate, shedding new insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrate
IFN-based antiviral networks.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is highly
expressed in myeloid progenitors, while most myeloid leukemias show low or absent
expression. Loss of IRF8 in mice leads to a myeloproliferative disorder,
indicating a tumor-suppressive role of IRF8. The Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) protein
represses the IRF8-promoter. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 can act as a
transcriptional co-factor of WT1 and potentiate the cytotoxic response to the
cytostatic drug cytarabine. We hypothesized that cytarabine upregulates IRF8 and 
that transcriptional control of IRF8 involves WT1 and ZNF224. Treatment of
leukemic K562 cells with cytarabine upregulated IRF8 protein and mRNA, which was 
correlated to increased expression of ZNF224. Knock down of ZNF224 with shRNA
suppressed both basal and cytarabine-induced IRF8 expression. While ZNF224 alone 
did not affect IRF8 promoter activity, ZNF224 partially reversed the suppressive 
effect of WT1 on the IRF8 promoter, as judged by luciferase reporter experiments.
Coprecipitation revealed nuclear binding of WT1 and ZNF224, and by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments it was demonstrated that WT1 recruits
ZNF224 to the IRF8 promoter. We conclude that cytarabine-induced upregulation of 
the IRF8 in leukemic cells involves increased levels of ZNF224, which can
counteract the repressive activity of WT1 on the IRF8-promoter.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 and the regulation of neutrophil, monocyte, and
dendritic cell production.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription
factor that plays central roles in the regulation of myeloid cell fate. In both
mice and humans, IRF8 is required for the differentiation of most monocyte and
dendritic cell subsets, but suppresses neutrophil production. IRF8 mutations can 
cause immunodeficiency, and the dysregulated differentiation that underlies
myeloid leukemia has been attributed in part to reduced IRF8 expression. In this 
review we discuss recent studies that have revealed molecular mechanisms
underlying the regulation of myelopoiesis by IRF8, which cooperates with other
transcription factors to control the initiation of gene expression programs that 
define the development of specific myeloid cell subsets.
RECENT FINDINGS: It is now clear that IRF8 regulates cell fate choice by both
promoting monocyte/dendritic cell differentiation and suppressing neutrophil
differentiation. Recent studies have shown that it collaborates with PU.1 to
promote monocyte gene expression (in part via induction of Krüppel-like
factor-4), associates with Batf3 to induce CD8a conventional dendritic cell
differentiation via autoregulation of its own expression, and restricts
neutrophil gene expression by disrupting the binding of c/EBPa to target genes.
SUMMARY: These studies have emphasized the importance of IRF8 in the regulation
of myelopoiesis and are revealing novel therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) metabolizes L-arginine to
produce nitric oxide (NO) which was originally identified in myeloid cells as a
host defense mechanism against pathogens. Recent studies, however, have revealed 
that iNOS is often induced in tumor cells and myeloid cells in the tumor
microenvironment. Compelling experimental data have shown that iNOS promotes
tumor development in certain cellular context and suppresses tumor development in
other cellular conditions. The molecular mechanisms underlying these contrasting 
functions of iNOS is unknown. Because iNOS is often induced by inflammatory
signals, it is therefore likely that these contrasting functions of iNOS could be
controlled by the inflammatory signaling pathways, which remains to be
determined.
METHODS: iNOS is expressed in colon carcinoma and myeloid cells in the tumor
microenvironment. Colon carcinoma and myeloid cell lines were used to elucidate
the molecular mechanisms underlying iNOS expression. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to
determine the IFN<U+03B3>-activated pSTAT1 and NF-<U+03BA>B association with the chromatin DNA 
of the nos2 promoter.
RESULTS: We show here that iNOS is dramatically up-regulated in inflammed human
colon tissues and in human colon carcinoma as compared to normal colon tissue.
iNOS is expressed in either the colon carcinoma cells or immune cells within the 
tumor microenvironment. On the molecular level, the proinflammatory IFN<U+03B3> and
NF-<U+03BA>B signals induce iNOS expression in human colon cancer cells. We further
demonstrate that NF-<U+03BA>B directly binds to the NOS2 promoter to regulate iNOS
expression. Although neither the IFN<U+03B3> signaling pathway nor the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling
pathway alone is sufficient to induce iNOS expression in myeloid cells, IFN<U+03B3> and 
NF-<U+03BA>B synergistically induce iNOS expression in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we
determine that IFN<U+03B3> up-regulates IRF8 expression to augment NF-<U+03BA>B induction of
iNOS expression. More interestingly, we observed that the p65/p65 and p50/p50
homodimers, not the canonical p65/p50 heterodimer, directly binds to the nos2
promoter to regulate iNOS expression in myeloid cells.
CONCLUSIONS: IFN<U+03B3>-induced IRF8 acts in concert with NF-<U+03BA>B to regulate iNOS
expression in both colon carcinoma and myeloid cells. In myeloid cells, the NF-<U+03BA>B
complexes that bind to the nos2 promoter are p65/p65 and p50/p50 homodimers.

Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the receptor for interleukin-1 (IL-1R) signaling
play an important role in bacteria-mediated bone loss diseases including
periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Recent studies have shown
that TLR ligands inhibit the receptor activator of NF-<U+03BA>B ligand (RANKL)-induced
osteoclast differentiation from un-committed osteoclast precursors, whereas IL-1 
potentiates RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. However, IL-1R and TLR belong to 
the same IL-1R/TLR superfamily, and activate similar intracellular signaling
pathways. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct
effects of IL-1 and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS-PG) on
RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Our results show that LPS-PG and IL-1
differentially regulate RANKL-induced activation of osteoclast genes encoding
Car2, Ctsk, MMP9, and TRAP, as well as expression of NFATc1, a master
transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis. Regulation of osteoclast genes and
NFATc1 by LPS-PG and IL-1 is dependent on MyD88, an important signaling adaptor
for both TLR and IL-1R family members. Furthermore, LPS-PG and IL-1
differentially regulate RANKL-costimulatory receptor OSCAR (osteoclast-associated
receptor) expression and Ca(2+) oscillations induced by RANKL. Moreover, LPS-PG
completely abrogates RANKL-induced gene expression of B lymphocyte-induced
maturation protein-1 (Blimp1), a global transcriptional repressor of
anti-osteoclastogenic genes encoding Bcl6, IRF8, and MafB. However, IL-1 enhances
RANKL-induced blimp1 gene expression but suppresses the gene expression of bcl6, 
irf8, and mafb. Our study reveals the involvement of multiple signaling molecules
in the differential regulation of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by TLR2 and
IL-1 signaling. Understanding the signaling cross-talk among TLR, IL-1R, and RANK
is critical for identifying therapeutic strategies to control bacteria-mediated
bone loss.

Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells that develop from 
hematopoietic stem cells through successive steps of lineage commitment and
differentiation. Multipotent progenitors (MPP) are committed to DC restricted
common DC progenitors (CDP), which differentiate into specific DC subsets,
classical DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC). To determine epigenetic states and 
regulatory circuitries during DC differentiation, we measured consecutive changes
of genome-wide gene expression, histone modification and transcription factor
occupancy during the sequel MPP-CDP-cDC/pDC. Specific histone marks in CDP reveal
a DC-primed epigenetic signature, which is maintained and reinforced during DC
differentiation. Epigenetic marks and transcription factor PU.1 occupancy
increasingly coincide upon DC differentiation. By integrating PU.1 occupancy and 
gene expression we devised a transcription factor regulatory circuitry for DC
commitment and subset specification. The circuitry provides the transcription
factor hierarchy that drives the sequel MPP-CDP-cDC/pDC, including Irf4, Irf8,
Tcf4, Spib and Stat factors. The circuitry also includes feedback loops inferred 
for individual or multiple factors, which stabilize distinct stages of DC
development and DC subsets. In summary, here we describe the basic regulatory
circuitry of transcription factors that drives DC development.

Upon recognition of antigen, B cells undertake a bifurcated response in which
some cells rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts while others undergo affinity 
maturation in germinal centers (GCs). Here we identified a double-negative
feedback loop between the transcription factors IRF4 and IRF8 that regulated the 
initial developmental bifurcation of activated B cells as well as the GC
response. IRF8 dampened signaling via the B cell antigen receptor (BCR),
facilitated antigen-specific interaction with helper T cells, and promoted
antibody affinity maturation while antagonizing IRF4-driven differentiation of
plasmablasts. Genomic analysis revealed concentration-dependent actions of IRF4
and IRF8 in regulating distinct gene-expression programs. Stochastic modeling
suggested that the double-negative feedback was sufficient to initiate
bifurcation of the B cell developmental trajectories.

Super-enhancers (SEs), which are composed of large clusters of enhancers densely 
loaded with the Mediator complex, transcription factors and chromatin regulators,
drive high expression of genes implicated in cell identity and disease, such as
lineage-controlling transcription factors and oncogenes. BRD4 and CDK7 are
positive regulators of SE-mediated transcription. By contrast, negative
regulators of SE-associated genes have not been well described. Here we show that
the Mediator-associated kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and CDK19
restrain increased activation of key SE-associated genes in acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) cells. We report that the natural product cortistatin A (CA)
selectively inhibits Mediator kinases, has anti-leukaemic activity in vitro and
in vivo, and disproportionately induces upregulation of SE-associated genes in
CA-sensitive AML cell lines but not in CA-insensitive cell lines. In AML cells,
CA upregulated SE-associated genes with tumour suppressor and lineage-controlling
functions, including the transcription factors CEBPA, IRF8, IRF1 and ETV6 (refs
6-8). The BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 downregulated these SE-associated genes, yet
also has anti-leukaemic activity. Individually increasing or decreasing the
expression of these transcription factors suppressed AML cell growth, providing
evidence that leukaemia cells are sensitive to the dosage of SE-associated genes.
Our results demonstrate that Mediator kinases can negatively regulate
SE-associated gene expression in specific cell types, and can be
pharmacologically targeted as a therapeutic approach to AML.

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells that accumulate in the joints of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis causing severe bone damage. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 
ligand is enriched in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
and local exposure to Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand aggravates arthritis in
mice. Because Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand has been suggested to facilitate 
osteoclast differentiation, we asked whether Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand
affects bone remodeling in arthritis. The effect of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3
signaling on osteoclast development was studied by immunohistochemistry in
methylated bovine serum albumin-induced arthritis using mice that lack the gene
for Flt3l (Flt3L(-/-)) and by an in vitro assay. Bone and joint changes were
studied morphologically and by microcomputer tomography. We found that Flt3L(-/-)
mice had increased accumulations of osteoclasts in the periarticular area of the 
arthritic joint. This triggered bone destruction and trabecular bone loss. The
increased number of osteoclasts in Flt3L(-/-) mice may be a consequence of
insufficient expression of interferon regulatory factor 8. Treatment of
Flt3L(-/-) mice with Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand increased expression of
interferon regulatory factor 8, reduced the number of osteoclasts in arthritic
mice, and promoted trabecular bone formation. Finally, the reduced number of
regulatory T cells in the bone marrow of Flt3L(-/-) mice could further contribute
to the increased osteoclastogenesis by reducing the ratio of regulatory T cells
to T helper 17 cells. This study shows that Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand may
serve as a negative regulator of osteoclast development by promoting
transcription of interferon regulatory factor 8 and sustaining a balance between 
protective regulatory T cells and pathogenic T helper 17 cells in the
pathogenesis of arthritis.

Modest transcriptional changes caused by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms are
frequent in human cancer. Although loss or near-complete loss of the
hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in
mice, a similar degree of PU.1 impairment is exceedingly rare in human AML; yet, 
moderate PU.1 inhibition is common in AML patients. We assessed functional
consequences of modest reductions in PU.1 expression on leukemia development in
mice harboring DNA lesions resembling those acquired during human stem cell
aging. Heterozygous deletion of an enhancer of PU.1, which resulted in a 35%
reduction of PU.1 expression, was sufficient to induce myeloid-biased preleukemic
stem cells and their subsequent transformation to AML in a DNA mismatch
repair-deficient background. AML progression was mediated by inhibition of
expression of a PU.1-cooperating transcription factor, Irf8. Notably, we found
marked molecular similarities between the disease in these mice and human
myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. This study demonstrates that minimal reduction 
of a key lineage-specific transcription factor, which commonly occurs in human
disease, is sufficient to initiate cancer development, and it provides
mechanistic insight into the formation and progression of preleukemic stem cells 
in AML.

BACKGROUND: Despite of numerous studies on periodontitis, the mechanism
underlying the progression of periodontitis still remains largely unknown. This
study aimed to have an expression profiling comparison between periodontitis and 
normal control and to identify more candidate genes involved in periodontitis and
to gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms of periodontitis progression.
METHODS: The gene expression profile of GSE16134, comprising 241 gingival tissue 
specimens and 69 healthy samples as control which were obtained from 120
systemically healthy patients with periodontitis (65 with chronic and 55 with
aggressive periodontitis), was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in periodontitis samples were
screened using the limma package in R compared with control samples. Gene
Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis upon the DEGs were carried out
using Hypergeometric Distribution test. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
of the DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape, followed by module selection from
the PPI network using MCODE plugin. Moreover, transcription factors (TFs) of
these DEGs were identified based on TRANSFAC database and then a regulatory
network was constructed.
RESULTS: Totally, 762 DEGs (507 up- and 255 down-regulated) in periodontitis
samples were identified. DEGs were enriched in different GO terms and pathways,
such as immune system process, cell activation biological processes,
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and metabolic pathways. Cathepsin S
(CTSS) and pleckstrin (PLEK) were the hub proteins in the PPI network and 3
significant modules were selected. Moreover, 19 TFs were identified including
interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), and FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene
homolog B (FOSB).
CONCLUSION: This study identified genes (CTSS, PLEK, IRF-8, PTGS2, and FOSB) that
may be involved in the development and progression of periodontitis.

The molecular mechanism underlying the lethal phenomenon of urothelial carcinoma 
(UC) tumor recurrence remains unresolved. Here, by methylation microarray, we
identified promoter methylation of the zinc-finger protein gene, ZNF671 in
bladder UC tumor tissue samples, a finding that was independently validated by
bisulphite pyrosequencing in cell lines and tissue samples. Subsequent assays
including treatment with epigenetic depressive agents and in vitro methylation
showed ZNF671 methylation to result in its transcriptional repression. ZNF671
re-expression in UC cell lines, via ectopic expression, inhibited tumor growth
and invasion, in possible conjunction with downregulation of cancer stem cell
markers (c-KIT, NANOG, OCT4). Clinically, high ZNF671 methylation in UC tumor
tissues (n=96; 63 bladder, 33 upper urinary tract) associated with tumor grade
and poor locoregional disease-free survival. Quantitative MSP analysis in a
training (n=97) and test (n=61) sets of voided urine samples from bladder UC
patients revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 42%-48% and 89%-92.8%,
respectively, for UC cancer detection. Moreover, combining DNA methylation of
ZNF671 and 2 other genes (IRF8 and sFRP1) further increased the sensitivity to
96.2%, suggesting a possible three-gene UC biomarker. In summary, ZNF671, an
epigenetically silenced novel tumor suppressor, represents a potential predictor 
for UC relapse and non-invasive biomarker that could assist in UC clinical
decision-making.

Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) plays a crucial role in the transformation 
of microglia to a reactive state by regulating the expression of various genes.
In the present study, we show that IRF1 is required for IRF8-induced gene
expression in microglia. Peripheral nerve injury induced IRF1 gene upregulation
in the spinal microglia in an IRF8-dependent manner. IRF8 transduction in
cultured microglia induced de novo gene expression of IRF1. Importantly,
knockdown of the IRF1 gene in IRF8-transduced microglia prevented upregulation of
interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). Therefore, our findings suggest that expression of IL-1ß 
is dependent on IRF1 in IRF8-expressing reactive microglia.

IRF8 is a transcription factor with a critical role in B lymphocyte development
and functions. Its role in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), however, 
remained elusive. In this study, using shRNA-mediated knockdown of IRF8
expression, we found that the loss of IRF8 significantly reduced the
proliferation of DLBCL cells (P<0.05). Mechanistically, decreasing the levels of 
IRF8 led to a suppression of the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, molecules
critical for B cell proliferation. Furthermore, using a xenograft lymphoma mouse 
model, we found that the loss of IRF8 significantly inhibited the growth of
lymphomas in vivo (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of human DLBCL tissues
revealed that the levels of IRF8 were significantly greater in non-germinal
center B-cell-like (non-GCB) subtype than that in GCB subtype (P<0.05). Analysis 
of public available data also suggested that the expression levels of IRF8 mRNA
in human DLBCL tissues were inversely correlated with patients' overall survival 
time. Taken together, this study suggested that IRF8 may play an oncogenic role
in human DLBCL by promoting cell proliferation.

Cancer-driven granulo-monocytopoiesis stimulates expansion of tumor promoting
myeloid populations, mostly myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We identified subsets of MDSCs and TAMs
based on the expression of retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (RORC1/ROR<U+03B3>) in 
human and mouse tumor bearers. RORC1 orchestrates myelopoiesis by suppressing
negative (Socs3 and Bcl3) and promoting positive (C/EBPß) regulators of
granulopoiesis, as well as the key transcriptional mediators of myeloid
progenitor commitment and differentiation to the monocytic/macrophage lineage
(IRF8 and PU.1). RORC1 supported tumor-promoting innate immunity by protecting
MDSCs from apoptosis, mediating TAM differentiation and M2 polarization, and
limiting tumor infiltration by mature neutrophils. Accordingly, ablation of RORC1
in the hematopoietic compartment prevented cancer-driven myelopoiesis, resulting 
in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.

Transcription factor IRF8 controls Th1-like regulatory T-cell function.

Lee W, Kim HS, Baek SY, Lee GR.

Recent studies have suggested that regulatory T (Treg) cells comprise a
heterogeneous population that regulates various aspects of the immune response,
and that Treg cells use the factors that are expressed in their target cells to
regulate them. We searched for factors that regulate Th1 response in Treg cells
using a meta-analysis. In the process, we discovered that transcription factor
interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) was selectively expressed in Treg and Th1
cells. IRF8-deficient Treg cells showed defective expression of CXCR3 and
aberrant expression of the Il4 and Il17 genes. Upon treatment with alpha
galactosyl-C18-ceramide (aGal-C18-Cer), IRF8-deficient mice showed defective Treg
cell recruitment in the liver. Eliciting Th1 immune response by anti-CD40
antibody injection in mice induced IRF8 expression in Treg cells. The expression 
of IRF8 was induced by Foxp3 in Treg cells. IRF8 had no effect on T-bet
expression in Treg and vice versa. Thus, our results strongly suggest that IRF8
controls Th1 immune response in Treg cells independent of T-bet.Cellular &

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is constitutively expressed in monocytes and B
cells and plays a critical role in the functional maturation of microglia cells. 
It is induced in T cells following Ag stimulation, but its functions are less
well understood. However, recent studies in mice with T cell-specific Irf8
disruption under direction of the Lck promoter (LCK-IRF8KO) suggest that IRF8
directs a silencing program for Th17 differentiation, and IL-17 production is
markedly increased in IRF8-deficient T cells. Paradoxically, loss of IRF8 in T
cells has no effect on the development or severity of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), although exacerbating colitis in a mouse colitis model. 
In contrast, mice with a macrophage/microglia-specific Irf8 disruption are
resistant to EAE, further confounding our understanding of the roles of IRF8 in
host immunity and autoimmunity. To clarify the role of IRF8 in autoimmune
diseases, we have generated two mouse strains with targeted deletion of Irf8 in
retinal cells, including microglial cells and a third mouse strain with targeted 
Irf8 deletion in T cells under direction of the nonpromiscuous, CD4 promoter
(CD4-IRF8KO). In contrast to the report that IRF8 deletion in T cells has no
effect on EAE, experimental autoimmune uveitis is exacerbated in CD4-IRF8KO mice 
and disease enhancement correlates with significant expansion of Th17 cells and a
reduction in T regulatory cells. In contrast to CD4-IRF8KO mice, Irf8 deletion in
retinal cells confers protection from uveitis, underscoring divergent and
tissue-specific roles of IRF8 in host immunity. These results raise a cautionary 
note in the context of therapeutic targeting of IRF8.

The transcription factors Batf3 and IRF8 are required for the development of
CD8a(+) conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), but the basis for their actions has 
remained unclear. Here we identified two progenitor cells positive for the
transcription factor Zbtb46 that separately generated CD8a(+) cDCs and CD4(+)
cDCs and arose directly from the common DC progenitor (CDP). Irf8 expression in
CDPs required prior autoactivation of Irf8 that was dependent on the
transcription factor PU.1. Specification of the clonogenic progenitor of CD8a(+) 
cDCs (the pre-CD8 DC) required IRF8 but not Batf3. However, after specification
of pre-CD8 DCs, autoactivation of Irf8 became Batf3 dependent at a CD8a(+)
cDC-specific enhancer with multiple transcription factor AP1-IRF composite
elements (AICEs) within the Irf8 superenhancer. CDPs from Batf3(-/-) mice that
were specified toward development into pre-CD8 DCs failed to complete their
development into CD8a(+) cDCs due to decay of Irf8 autoactivation and diverted to
the CD4(+) cDC lineage.

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria cause a broad range of clinical disorders, from
cutaneous infections, such as cervical or intrathoracic lymphadenitis in
children, to disseminated infections at all ages. Recognition of the underlying
immune defect is crucial for rational treatment, preventive care, family
screening, and, in some cases, transplantation. So far, at least seven autosomal 
mutations (in IL12B, IL12RB1, ISG15, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1, and IRF8) and two
X-linked mutations (in IKBKG and CYBB), mostly presenting in childhood, have been
reported to confer susceptibility to disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial
infection. GATA2 deficiency and anti-interferon <U+03B3> autoantibodies also give rise
to disseminated infection, typically in late childhood or adulthood. Furthermore,
isolated pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection has been increasing in
prevalence in people without recognised immune dysfunction. In this Review, we
discuss how to detect and differentiate host susceptibility factors underlying
localised and systemic non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections.

IRF8-MMP3 interaction.

Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), originally identified as a leukemic tumor 
suppressor, can also exert anti-neoplastic activities in solid tumors. We
previously showed that IRF8-loss enhanced tumor growth, which was accompanied by 
reduced tumor-cell susceptibility to apoptosis. However, the impact of IRF8
expression on tumor growth could not be explained solely by its effects on
regulating apoptotic response. Exploratory gene expression profiling further
revealed an inverse relationship between IRF8 and MMP3 expression, implying
additional intrinsic mechanisms by which IRF8 modulated neoplastic behavior.
Although MMP3 expression was originally linked to tumor initiation, the role of
MMP3 beyond this stage has remained unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that MMP3
governed later stages of disease, including progression to metastasis, and did so
through a novel IRF8-MMP3 axis. Altogether, we showed an inverse mechanistic
relationship between IRF8 and MMP3 expression in tumor progression. Importantly, 
the growth advantage due to IRF8-loss was significantly compromised after
silencing MMP3 expression. Moreover, MMP3-loss reduced spontaneous lung
metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of mammary carcinoma. MMP3 acted, in
part, in a cell-intrinsic manner and served as a direct transcriptional target of
IRF8. Thus, we identified a novel role of an IRF8-MMP3 axis in tumor progression,
which unveils new therapeutic opportunities.

Microglia form the immune system of the brain. Previous studies in cell cultures 
and animal models suggest altered activation states and cellular senescence in
the aged brain. Instead, we analyzed 3 transcriptome data sets from the
postmortem frontal cortex of 381 control individuals to show that microglia gene 
markers assemble into a transcriptional module in a gene coexpression network.
These markers predominantly represented M1 and M1/M2b activation phenotypes.
Expression of genes in this module generally declines over the adult life span.
This decrease was more pronounced in microglia surface receptors for microglia
and/or neuron crosstalk than in markers for activation state phenotypes. In
addition to these receptors for exogenous signals, microglia are controlled by
brain-expressed regulatory factors. We identified a subnetwork of transcription
factors, including RUNX1, IRF8, PU.1, and TAL1, which are master regulators (MRs)
for the age-dependent microglia module. The causal contributions of these MRs on 
the microglia module were verified using publicly available ChIP-Seq data.
Interactions of these key MRs were preserved in a protein-protein interaction
network. Importantly, these MRs appear to be essential for regulating microglia
homeostasis in the adult human frontal cortex in addition to their crucial roles 
in hematopoiesis and myeloid cell-fate decisions during embryogenesis.

The two major lineages of classical dendritic cells (cDCs) express and require
either IRF8 or IRF4 transcription factors for their development and function.
IRF8-dependent cDCs promote anti-viral and T-helper 1 (Th1) cell responses,
whereas IRF4-expressing cDCs have been implicated in controlling both Th2 and
Th17 cell responses. Here, we have provided evidence that Kruppel-like factor 4
(Klf4) is required in IRF4-expressing cDCs to promote Th2, but not Th17, cell
responses in vivo. Conditional Klf4 deletion within cDCs impaired Th2 cell
responses during Schistosoma mansoni infection, Schistosoma egg antigen (SEA)
immunization, and house dust mite (HDM) challenge without affecting cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL), Th1 cell, or Th17 cell responses to herpes simplex virus,
Toxoplasma gondii, and Citrobacter rodentium infections. Further, Klf4 deletion
reduced IRF4 expression in pre-cDCs and resulted in selective loss of
IRF4-expressing cDCs subsets in several tissues. These results indicate that Klf4
guides a transcriptional program promoting IRF4-expressing cDCs heterogeneity.

BACKGROUND: The occurrence of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is known to have 
a major adverse effect on interferon (INF)-a treatment. The genetic variant of
the INF regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a type 1 INF regulator, is associated with
susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. In this
study, we investigated possible associations of the IRF8 polymorphisms,
rs17445836 and rs2280381, with AITD in an ethnic Chinese population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 278 patients with Graves' disease (GD) and 55
patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), and 252 healthy controls were
enrolled. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) and direct sequencing were used for genotyping.
RESULTS: Significantly lower frequencies of the GA genotype and A allele of
rs17445836 were found in the HT group than in the control group (P = 0·028, odds 
ratio (OR) = 4·71 and P = 0·022, OR = 4·40, respectively). Both rs17445836 and
rs2280381 were associated with the presence of an antimicrosomal antibody (AmiA),
and rs2280381 was also associated with the presence of an antithyroglobulin
antibody (ATA) in AITD. Moreover, rs17445836 was associated with the level of
AmiA in AITD.
CONCLUSIONS: rs17445836 of IRF8 is a possible genetic variant associated with the
development of HT. rs17445836 was associated with the production of thyroid
antibody, and the GG genotype of rs17445836 was associated with a higher AmiA
titre than the GA genotype.

Clinical treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) can be complicated by
cytokine-induced glucocorticoid low-responsiveness (GC-resistance, GCR), a
condition associated with a homogeneous reduction in the expression of
GC-receptor- (GR-) driven anti-inflammatory genes. However, GR level and
phosphorylation changes modify the expression of individual GR-responsive genes
differently. As sustained IL-1ß exposure is key in the pathogenesis of several
major diseases with prevalent GCR, we examined GR signaling and the mRNA
expression of six GR-driven genes in cells cultured in IL-1ß and afterwards
challenged with GC. After a GC challenge, sustained IL-1ß exposure reduced the
cytoplasmic GR level, GR(Ser203) and GR(Ser211) phosphorylation, and GR nuclear
translocation and led to selective GCR in the expression of the studied genes.
Compared to GC alone, in a broad range of GC doses plus sustained IL-1ß, FKBP51
mRNA expression was reduced by 1/3, TTP by 2/3, and IRF8 was completely knocked
down. In contrast, high GC doses did not change the expression of GILZ and DUSP1,
while IGFBP1 was increased by 5-fold. These effects were cytokine-selective,
IL-1ß dose- and IL-1R1-dependent. The integrated gain and loss of gene functions 
in the "split GCR" model may provide target cells with a survival advantage by
conferring resistance to apoptosis, chemotherapy, and GC.

Inhibition of Janus-activated kinase-1 (JAK1) is a promising clinical concept for
post-transplant immunosuppression and autoimmunity. However, it also raises
concerns regarding possible immunosuppressive side effects. Our study
investigates JAK1 signalling in the context of CD40L and bacterially activated
human MoDC using siRNA and biological inhibitors. We demonstrate that strong
stimuli (e.g. intact Escherichia coli or LPS in addition to IL-1ß) induce
IL-12p70 via a ROS/RELA/CDK9 pathway that is inhibited by simultaneous JAK1/STAT3
signalling. Transcription is effective if RELA recruits the positive
transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) component CDK9 to a combined
RELA/STAT3 binding site -50 to -20bp upstream of the start site of the IL-12p35
promoter. STAT3 simultaneously attaches to this site and inhibits CDK9 binding.
In the presence of IFN<U+03B3>, JAK1/2 inhibitors block STAT1/IRF1/IRF8-dependent
activation and simultaneously enhance CDK9-dependent activation signals. This
inverse regulation of IFN<U+03B3>- vs. E. coli-induced cytokine production by JAK
inhibitors including Ruxolitinib was similarly observed for IL-6 and TNF-a
production, but not for IL-10 production. Thus, JAK1 inhibition enhances IL-12p70
production in this context by increased DNA binding of CDK9. In contrast, weak
RELA-activation signals (CD40L, LPS) depended on IFN-<U+03B3> induced STAT1/IRF1/IRF8
co-signalling, which was completely blocked by JAK inhibitors as reported before.
Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism of how cytokine responses to
invading pathogens are separable from IFN<U+03B3>-dependent autoimmunity by targeting
JAK1/STAT3 activation.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuro-inflammatory disease of complex
etiology. The results of GWAS, a high-throughput method to discover genetic
architecture of MS, require replication in independent ethnic groups. We
performed a replication study of nine GWAS-identified SNPs in immune response in 
Russians. Associations of CLEC16A and IL2RA with MS were validated. Besides, we
observed the associations of CLEC16A and IRF8 in women, and IL7RA and CD58 in
men. With multi-locus association analysis two protective biallelic combinations:
(TNFRSF1A*T+CLEC16A*A) and (TNFRSF1A*T+IRF8*A) were identified in women.
Associations of CLEC16A*G/G and both biallelic combinations in women with MS
survived the permutation test.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune
disease. Currently, numerous genetic loci of SLE have been confirmed. Here we try
to further explore additional genes contributing to SLE susceptibility in this
study.
METHODS: Forty nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with moderate-risk for
SLE in previous study were genotyped in a large-scale replication study with a
total of 3,522 cases and 8,252 controls using the Sequenom Massarray system.
Association analyses were performed using logistic regression with gender or
sample cohorts as a covariate through PLINK 1.07 software.
RESULTS: This replication effort confirmed five reported SLE susceptibility loci 
reaching genome-wide levels of significance (P(meta) <5.00<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-08)): TNFSF4
(rs1418190, odds ratio (OR)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81, P(meta)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-08); rs4916219,
OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.80, P(meta<U+2009>)=<U+2009>7.77<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-09)), IRF8 (rs2934498, OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.25,
P(meta)<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.97<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-09)), miR-146a (rs2431697, OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.69,
P(meta)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.15<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-22)), CD44 (rs2732547, OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.82, P(meta)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.55<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-11)),
and TMEM39A (rs12494314, OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.84, P(meta)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.01<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-09)). Further logistic
regression analysis indicated that the genetic effects within TNFSF4 detected in 
this study are independent from our previously reported signals.
CONCLUSIONS: This study increases the number of established susceptibility loci
for SLE in Han Chinese population and highlights the contribution of multiple
variants of modest effect. Although further studies will be required to identify 
the causal alleles within these loci, the findings make a significant step
forward in our understanding of the genetic contribution to SLE in Chinese
population.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are
rare polygenic autoimmune diseases (AIDs) characterized by fibroblast
dysfunction. Furthermore, both diseases share some genetic bases with other AIDs,
as evidenced by autoimmune gene pleiotropism. The present study was undertaken to
investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by a large 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) in PBC might contribute to SSc
susceptibility.
METHODS: Sixteen PBC susceptibility SNPs were genotyped in a total of 1,616
patients with SSc and 3,621 healthy controls from two European populations
(France and Italy).
RESULTS: We observed an association between PLCL2 rs1372072 (odds ratio
(OR)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.33, P adj<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.22<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-5)),
nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-<U+03BA>B) rs7665090 (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25, P
adj<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), and IRF8 rs11117432 (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, P
adj<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.49<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-4)) with SSc susceptibility. Furthermore, phenotype
stratification showed an association between rs1372072 and rs11117432 with the
limited cutaneous subgroup (lcSSc) (P adj<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.45<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-4) and P adj<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001),
whereas rs7665090 was associated with the diffuse cutaneous subtype (dcSSc) (P
adj<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003). Genotype-mRNA expression correlation analysis revealed that the
IRF8 protective allele was associated with increased interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>)
expression (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03) in patients with SSc but decreased type I IFN (IFIT1)
expression in patients and controls (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02). In addition, we found an
epistatic interaction between NF-<U+03BA>B and IRF8 (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.56, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74,
P<U+2009>=<U+2009>4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(-4)) which in turn revealed that the IRF8 protective effect is
dependent on the presence of the NF-<U+03BA>B susceptibility allele.
CONCLUSIONS: An analysis of pleiotropic genes identified two new susceptibility
genes for SSc (NF-<U+03BA>B and PLCL2) and confirmed the IRF8 locus. Furthermore, the
IRF8 variant influenced the IFN signature, and we found an interaction between
IRF8 and NF-<U+03BA>B gene variants that might play a role in SSc susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: Precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell ALL) is the
most common neoplasm in children and is characterized by genetic and epigenetic
aberrations in hematopoietic transcription factor (TF) genes. This study
evaluated promoter DNA methylation and aberrant expression levels of early- and
late-acting hematopoietic TF genes homeobox A4 and A5 (HOXA4 and HOXA5), Meis
homeobox 1 (MEIS1), T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1), and interferon
regulatory factors 4 and 8 (IRF4 and IRF8) in pediatric B-cell ALL.
METHODS: Blood samples of 38 ALL patients and 20 controls were obtained. DNA was 
treated with sodium bisulfite and DNA methylation level of HOXA4, HOXA5, MEIS1,
TAL1, IRF4, and IRF8 was assessed using quantitative methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Relative gene expression was measured using
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.
RESULTS: Aberrant methylation of TAL1, IRF8, MEIS1, and IRF4 was observed in
26.3%, 7.9%, 5.3%, and 2.6% patients, respectively, but not in controls. HOXA4
and HOXA5 were methylated in some controls and hypermethylated in 16% and 5%
patients, respectively. IRF8, MEIS1, and TAL1 expression was lower in patients
than in controls. MEIS1 expression was inversely correlated with white blood cell
(WBC) count. HOXA4 expression was down-regulated in patients with high risk
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification. TAL1 methylation
was slightly elevated in patients aged >9 years and in patients showing relapse, 
suggesting its potential prognostic value.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant methylation and expression of the selected hematopoietic
genes were correlated with demographic/clinical prognostic factors of pediatric
ALL, such as age, WBC count, and NCI risk classification.

Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells formed mainly on bone surfaces in response
to cytokines by fusion of bone marrow-derived myeloid lineage precursors that
circulate in the blood. Major advances in understanding of the molecular
mechanisms regulating osteoclast formation and functions have been made in the
past 20 years since the discovery that their formation requires nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B
(NF-<U+03BA>B) signaling and that this is activated in response to the essential
osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of NF-<U+03BA>B ligand (RANKL), which also
controls osteoclast activation to resorb (degrade) bone. These studies have
revealed that RANKL and some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis
factor, activate NF-<U+03BA>B and downstream signaling, including c-Fos and nuclear
factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), and inhibition of repressors
of NFATc1 signaling, to positively regulate osteoclast formation and functions.
However, these cytokines also activate NF-<U+03BA>B signaling that can limit osteoclast 
formation through the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling proteins, TRAF3 and p100, and the
suppressors of c-Fos/NFATc1 signaling, IRF8, and RBP-J. This paper reviews
current understanding of how NF-<U+03BA>B signaling is involved in the positive and
negative regulation of cytokine-mediated osteoclast formation and activation.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can influence the destiny of hematopoietic 
stem/progenitor cells (HSCs) and exert broadly immunomodulatory effects on immune
cells. However, how MSCs regulate the differentiation of regulatory dendritic
cells (regDCs) from HSCs remains incompletely understood. In this study, we show 
that mouse bone marrow-derived Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MSCs can drive HSCs to
differentiate into a novel IFN regulatory factor (IRF)8-controlled regDC
population (Sca(+) BM-MSC-driven DC [sBM-DCs]) when cocultured without exogenous 
cytokines. The Notch pathway plays a critical role in the generation of the
sBM-DCs by controlling IRF8 expression in an RBP-J-dependent way. We observed a
high level of H3K27me3 methylation and a low level of H3K4me3 methylation at the 
Irf8 promoter during sBM-DC induction. Importantly, infusion of sBM-DCs could
alleviate colitis in mice with inflammatory bowel disease by inhibiting
lymphocyte proliferation and increasing the numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T
cells. Thus, these data infer a possible mechanism for the development of regDCs 
and further support the role of MSCs in treating immune disorders.

[Mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain revealing by the role
of glial cells].

[Article in Japanese]

Tsuda M.

Injury to the nervous system results in debilitating chronic pain states (called 
neuropathic pain) whose mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging lines of evidence
indicate the pivotal role of spinal glial cells in neuropathic pain. Spinal
microglia rapidly respond to peripheral nerve injury (PNI) and become activated
with changing expression of a variety of genes. The best known example is
purinergic P2X4 receptors, an ATP-gated cation channel. The expression of P2X4
receptors is upregulated in spinal microglia after PNI, and inhibition of P2X4
activity suppresses neuropathic pain. Furthermore, interferon regulatory factor-8
(IRF8) and IRF5 are identified as microglial transcription factors whose
expression is upregulated in spinal microglia after PNI, and the IRF8-IRF5
transcriptional cascade is the core process for shifting spinal microglia toward 
a state with high expression of P2X4 receptors. Astrocytes in the spinal cord
show a delayed onset of activation and play an important role in the maintenance 
of neuropathic pain via the transcription factor STAT3 and the intracellular
kinase JNK. These results obtained from glial cell research will advance our
understanding of the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain and provide 
a new target for treating this pain.

Autophagy, activated by many stresses, plays a critical role in innate immune
responses. Here we show that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is required
for the expression of autophagy-related genes in dendritic cells. Furthermore in 
macrophages, IRF8 is induced by multiple autophagy-inducing stresses, including
IFN<U+03B3> and Toll-like receptor stimulation, bacterial infection, starvation and by
macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IRF8 directly activates many genes involved
in various steps of autophagy, promoting autophagosome formation and lysosomal
fusion. Consequently, Irf8(-/-) macrophages are deficient in autophagic activity,
and excessively accumulate SQSTM1 and ubiquitin-bound proteins. We show that
clearance of Listeria monocytogenes in macrophages requires IRF8-dependent
activation of autophagy genes and subsequent autophagic capturing and degradation
of Listeria antigens. These processes are defective in Irf8(-/-) macrophages
where uninhibited bacterial growth ensues. Together these data suggest that IRF8 
is a major autophagy regulator in macrophages, essential for macrophage
maturation, survival and innate immune responses.

Human thymus contains two major subpopulations of dendritic cells (DCs),
conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which are mainly involved in
central tolerance and also in protecting the thymus against infections. In blood 
and peripheral organs cDCs include the subpopulation of BDCA3(hi) DCs, considered
as equivalents to mouse CD8a(+) DCs. In this study we describe in human thymus
the presence of a discrete population of BDCA3(hi) DCs that, like their
peripheral counterparts, express CD13, low-intermediate levels of CD11c, CLEC9A, 
high levels of XCR1, IRF8 and TLR3, and mostly lack the expression of CD11b, CD14
and TLR7. Thymic BDCA3(hi) DCs display immature features with a low expression of
costimulatory molecules and HLA-DR, and a low allostimulatory capacity. Also,
BDCA3(hi) DCs exhibit a strong response to TLR3 stimulation, producing high
levels of interferon (IFN)-<U+03BB>1 and CXCL10, which indicates that, similarly to
thymic pDCs, BDCA3(hi) DCs can have an important role in thymus protection
against viral infections.

Nature and nurture: a case of transcending haematological pre-malignancies in a

proliferations.

We describe a comprehensive molecular analysis of a pair of monozygotic twins,
who came to our attention when one experienced amaurosis fugax and was diagnosed 
with JAK2+ polycythaemia vera. He (Twin A) was also found to have an asymptomatic
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Although JAK2-, Twin B was
subsequently shown to have a benign monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Flow
cytometric and molecular analyses of the B-cell compartments revealed different
immunoglobulin light and heavy chain usage in each twin. We hypothesized that
whole exome sequencing could help delineating the pattern of germline B-cell
disorder susceptibility and reveal somatic mutations potentially contributing to 
the differential patterns of pre-malignancy. Comparing bone marrow cells and T
cells and employing in-house engineered integrative analysis, we found
aberrations in Twin A consistent with a myeloid neoplasm, i.e. in TET2, RUNX1,
PLCB1 and ELF4. Employing the method for detecting high-ranking variants by
extensive annotation and relevance scoring, we also identified shared germline
variants in genes of proteins interacting with B-cell receptor signalling
mediators and the WNT-pathway, including IRF8, PTPRO, BCL9L, SIT1 and SIRPB1, all
with possible implications in B-cell proliferation. Similar patterns of IGHV-gene
usage to those demonstrated here have been observed in inherited acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia. Collectively, these findings may help in facilitating
identification of putative master gene(s) involved in B-cell proliferations in
general and MBL and B-CLL in particular.

Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor expressed in
hematopoietic cells, particularly in mononuclear phagocytes
[monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)] and their progenitors. Various 
studies have demonstrated that IRF8 is essential for the development of
monocytes, DCs, eosinophils, and basophils. Conversely, IRF8 suppresses the
generation of neutrophils. Accordingly, Irf8 (-/-) mice develop immunodeficiency 
and a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like disease. Mutations and loss of
expression of the human IRF8 gene are also associated with immunodeficiency and
CML, respectively. Recent findings have begun to reveal the transcription factor 
network and epigenetic changes governed by IRF8. For example, in mononuclear
phagocyte progenitors, IRF8 cooperates with PU.1 to promote the formation of
promoter-distal enhancers to induce monocyte-related genes including the critical
downstream transcription factor gene Klf4. On the other hand, IRF8 blocks C/EBPa 
activity to suppress the neutrophil differentiation program. Indeed, Irf8 (-/-)
mononuclear phagocyte progenitors fail to efficiently generate monocytes and DCs 
and, instead, aberrantly give rise to neutrophils. This article provides an
overview of recent advances in our understanding of the role of IRF8 in
myelopoiesis and related diseases.

Infection and inflammation are invariably associated with activation of the blood
coagulation mechanism, secondary to the inflammation-induced expression of the
coagulation initiator tissue factor (TF) on innate immune cells. By investigating
the role of cell-surface receptors for coagulation factors in mouse endotoxemia, 
we found that the protein C receptor (ProcR; EPCR) was required for the normal in
vivo and in vitro induction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-regulated gene
expression. In cultured bone marrow-derived myeloid cells and in monocytic
RAW264.7 cells, the LPS-induced expression of functionally active TF, assembly of
the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa initiation complex of blood coagulation, and the
EPCR-dependent activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) by the ternary 
TF-VIIa-Xa complex were required for the normal LPS induction of messenger RNAs
encoding the TLR3/4 signaling adaptor protein Pellino-1 and the transcription
factor interferon regulatory factor 8. In response to in vivo challenge with LPS,
mice lacking EPCR or PAR2 failed to fully initiate an interferon-regulated gene
expression program that included the Irf8 target genes Lif, Iigp1, Gbp2, Gbp3,
and Gbp6. The inflammation-induced expression of TF and crosstalk with EPCR,
PAR2, and TLR4 therefore appear necessary for the normal evolution of
interferon-regulated host responses.

The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of genes encodes a group of
transcription factors that have important roles not only in regulating the
expression of Type I interferons (IFNs) and other genes in the IFN pathway, but
also in growth, development and the regulation of oncogenesis. In this study,
several IRF family members (Irf4a, Irf4b, Irf7, Irf8, Irf10) in Atlantic cod
(Gadus morhua) were characterized at the cDNA and putative amino acid levels,
allowing for phylogenetic analysis of these proteins in teleost fish, as well as 
the development of gene-specific primers used in RT-PCR and quantitative PCR
(QPCR) analyses. Two Atlantic cod Irf10 splice variants were identified and their
presence confirmed by sequencing of the Irf10 genomic region. RT-PCR showed that 
Irf7, Irf8 and both Irf10 transcripts were expressed in all 15 cod tissues
tested, while Irf4a and Irf4b were absent in some tissues. QPCR analysis of
spleen expression expanded upon this, and upon previous work. All IRF transcripts
in the study were responsive to stimulation by the viral mimic poly(I:C), and all
except Irf4a were responsive to exposure to formalin-killed Aeromonas salmonicida
(ASAL). These IRF genes, thus, are likely important in the cod immune response to
both viral and bacterial infections. Increased temperature (10 °C to 16 °C) was
also observed to modulate the antibacterial responses of all IRF transcripts, and
the antiviral responses of Irf4b and Irf10-v2. This research supports earlier
studies which reported that elevated temperature modulates the expression of many
immune genes in Atlantic cod.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) act as transcription mediators in virus-,
bacteria-, and interferon (IFN)-induced signaling pathways and play diverse
functions in antimicrobial defense, immune modulation, hematopoietic
differentiation, and cell apoptosis. In this study, we described for the first
time eleven IRFs (IRF1, IRF1L, IRF2X1, IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, IRF5, IRF6, IRF7,
IRF8, and IRF9) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and
examined their tissue distributions and expression patterns under different
conditions. The deduced protein sequences of these IRFs (except IRF1) share high 
identities (71.8-86.6%) with other corresponding IRFs in other teleosts, whereas 
the sequence identity of IRF1 with the corresponding IRF1 in other teleosts is
only 58.1%. A conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD), which is
characterized by a winged type helix-loop-helix motif with four to six tryptophan
repeats, is present in all IRFs. Another conserved IRF associated domain (IAD),
which mediates the interactions in the C-terminal part of the protein, is present
in all IRFs except IRF1 and IRF2X1, which instead contain the IAD2 domain.
Several special domains also were found, including a serine-rich domain (SRD) in 
IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, and IRF7; a proline-rich domain (PRD) in IRF9; nuclear
localization signals (NLSs) in IRF5, IRF8, and IRF9; and a virus activated domain
(VAD) in IRF5. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that
expression of all IRFs occurred in multiple tissues. IRF1, IRF2X1, IRF4a, IRF5,
IRF7, and IRF8 exhibited relatively high levels of expression in immune organs,
whereas the other five IRFs displayed high levels of expression in non-immune
organs. Infection with extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and
virus upregulated the expression of IRFs in a manner that depended on tissue
type, pathogen, and infection stage. Specifically, IRF1 and IRF2X1 were highly
induced by bacterial and viral pathogens; IRF1L and IRF6 responded mainly to
extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens; IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, IRF8, and 
IRF9 were markedly induced by intracellular bacterial pathogen and virus; IRF4a
and IRF4b were mainly induced by virus and intracellular bacterial pathogen
respectively. These results indicate that the IRFs of C. semilaevis can be
categorized into several groups which exhibit different expression patterns in
response to the infection of different microbial pathogens. These results provide
new insights into the roles of teleost IRFs in antimicrobial immunity.

Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic disease with high fatality.
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising vaccine candidate against EBOV. We
recently showed that VLPs protect mice from lethal EBOV infection when given
before or after viral infection. To elucidate pathways through which VLPs confer 
post-exposure protection, we investigated the role of type I interferon (IFN)
signaling. We found that VLPs lead to accelerated induction of IFN stimulated
genes (ISGs) in liver and spleen of wild type mice, but not in Ifnar-/- mice.
Accordingly, EBOV infected Ifnar-/- mice, unlike wild type mice succumbed to
death even after VLP treatment. The ISGs induced in wild type mice included
anti-viral proteins and negative feedback factors known to restrict viral
replication and excessive inflammatory responses. Importantly, proinflammatory
cytokine/chemokine expression was much higher in WT mice without VLPs than mice
treated with VLPs. In EBOV infected Ifnar-/- mice, however, uninhibited viral
replication and elevated proinflammatory factor expression ensued, irrespective
of VLP treatment, supporting the view that type I IFN signaling helps to limit
viral replication and attenuate inflammatory responses. Further analyses showed
that VLP protection requires the transcription factor, IRF8 known to amplify type
I IFN signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages, the probable sites of initial
EBOV infection. Together, this study indicates that VLPs afford post-exposure
protection by promoting expeditious initiation of type I IFN signaling in the
host.

The generation of myeloid cells from their progenitors is regulated at the level 
of transcription by combinatorial control of key transcription factors
influencing cell-fate choice. To unravel the global dynamics of this process at
the transcript level, we generated transcription profiles for 91 human cell types
of myeloid origin by use of CAGE profiling. The CAGE sequencing of these samples 
has allowed us to investigate diverse aspects of transcription control during
myelopoiesis, such as identification of novel transcription factors, miRNAs, and 
noncoding RNAs specific to the myeloid lineage. We further reconstructed a
transcription regulatory network by clustering coexpressed transcripts and
associating them with enriched cis-regulatory motifs. With the use of the
bidirectional expression as a proxy for enhancers, we predicted over 2000 novel
enhancers, including an enhancer 38 kb downstream of IRF8 and an intronic
enhancer in the KIT gene locus. Finally, we highlighted relevance of these data
to dissect transcription dynamics during progressive maturation of granulocyte
precursors. A multifaceted analysis of the myeloid transcriptome is made
available (www.myeloidome.roslin.ed.ac.uk). This high-quality dataset provides a 
powerful resource to study transcriptional regulation during myelopoiesis and to 
infer the likely functions of unannotated genes in human innate immunity.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central
nervous system, which is thought to be triggered by environmental factors in
genetically susceptible individuals leading to activation of autoreactive T
lymphocytes. Large multi-centre genome-wide association studies have identified
multiple genetic risk loci in multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigated 
T cell transcriptomic changes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an
animal model for multiple sclerosis. We correlated these findings with the
multiple sclerosis risk genes postulated by the most recent Immunochip analysis
and found that multiple sclerosis susceptibility genes were significantly
regulated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our data indicate that
nine distinct genes associated with multiple sclerosis risk, Bach2, Il2ra, Irf8, 
Mertk, Odf3b, Plek, Rgs1, Slc30a7 and Thada, can be confirmed to be
differentially regulated in pathogenic CD4(+) T cells. During the effector phase 
within the inflamed CNS, CD4(+) T cells undergo comprehensive transformation and 
we identified key transcription factors and signalling networks involved in this 
process. The transformation was linked to metabolic changes with the involvement 
of liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor signalling and cholesterol biosynthesis, 
which might control the T cell effector function in the central nervous system.
Thus, our study confirms the involvement of multiple sclerosis risk genes in the 
pathophysiology of the animal model and sheds light on additional
disease-relevant inflammatory networks.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is endemic as a major infectious disease in
the tropical and subtropical countries, is caused by a protozoan parasite
Leishmania donovani. At present, restricted treatment options and lack of
vaccines intensify the problem of controlling VL. Therefore, finding a novel
immunoprophylactic or therapeutic principle is a pressing need. Here, we report
that arabinosylated lipoarabinomannan (Ara-LAM), a TLR2-ligand isolated from
Mycobacterium smegmatis, exhibits a strong immunomodulatory property that
conferred protection against L. donovani infection. Although, Ara-LAM modulates
TLR2 and MAPK signaling, it is not known whether Ara-LAM involves IFN-<U+03B3> signaling
for effective parasite clearance. Because, it is reported that IFN-<U+03B3> signaling, a
principle mediator of NO generation and macrophage and Tcell activation, is
hampered during leishmanial pathogenesis. Ara-LAM increases IFN-<U+03B3> receptor
expression and potentiates IFN-<U+03B3> receptor signaling through JAK-STAT pathway.
Moreover, Ara-LAM reciprocally modulates IRF4 and IRF8 expression and reinstates 
anti-leishmanial Th1 response that eventuates in significantly reduced parasite
load in spleen and liver of L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice. IFN-<U+03B3>Ra silencing
resulted in the suppression of these host-protective mechanisms affected by
Ara-LAM. Thus, Ara-LAM-mediated restoration of IFN-<U+03B3> responsiveness is a novel
immuno-modulatory principle for protection against L. donovani susceptible host.

During hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells constantly differentiate into
granulocytes and macrophages via a distinct differentiation program that is
tightly controlled by myeloid lineage-specific transcription factors. Mice with a
null mutation of IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) accumulate CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid
cells that phenotypically and functionally resemble tumor-induced myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), indicating an essential role of IRF8 in myeloid cell
lineage differentiation. However, IRF8 is expressed in various types of immune
cells, and whether IRF8 functions intrinsically or extrinsically in regulation of
myeloid cell lineage differentiation is not fully understood. In this study, we
report an intriguing finding that, although IRF8-deficient mice exhibit
deregulated myeloid cell differentiation and resultant accumulation of
CD11b(+)Gr1(+) MDSCs, surprisingly, mice with IRF8 deficiency only in myeloid
cells exhibit no abnormal myeloid cell lineage differentiation. Instead, mice
with IRF8 deficiency only in T cells exhibited deregulated myeloid cell
differentiation and MDSC accumulation. We further demonstrated that
IRF8-deficient T cells exhibit elevated GM-CSF expression and secretion.
Treatment of mice with GM-CSF increased MDSC accumulation, and adoptive transfer 
of IRF8-deficient T cells, but not GM-CSF-deficient T cells, increased MDSC
accumulation in the recipient chimeric mice. Moreover, overexpression of IRF8
decreased GM-CSF expression in T cells. Our data determine that, in addition to
its intrinsic function as an apoptosis regulator in myeloid cells, IRF8 also acts
extrinsically to repress GM-CSF expression in T cells to control myeloid cell
lineage differentiation, revealing a novel mechanism that the adaptive immune
component of the immune system regulates the innate immune cell myelopoiesis in
vivo.

The transcription factor (TF) interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) controls both
developmental and inflammatory stimulus-inducible genes in macrophages, but the
mechanisms underlying these two different functions are largely unknown. One
possibility is that these different roles are linked to the ability of IRF8 to
bind alternative DNA sequences. We found that IRF8 is recruited to distinct sets 
of DNA consensus sequences before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.
In resting cells, IRF8 was mainly bound to composite sites together with the
master regulator of myeloid development PU.1. Basal IRF8-PU.1 binding maintained 
the expression of a broad panel of genes essential for macrophage functions (such
as microbial recognition and response to purines) and contributed to basal
expression of many LPS-inducible genes. After LPS stimulation, increased
expression of IRF8, other IRFs, and AP-1 family TFs enabled IRF8 binding to
thousands of additional regions containing low-affinity multimerized IRF sites
and composite IRF-AP-1 sites, which were not premarked by PU.1 and did not
contribute to the basal IRF8 cistrome. While constitutively expressed
IRF8-dependent genes contained only sites mediating basal IRF8/PU.1 recruitment, 
inducible IRF8-dependent genes contained variable combinations of constitutive
and inducible sites. Overall, these data show at the genome scale how the same TF
can be linked to constitutive and inducible gene regulation via distinct
combinations of alternative DNA-binding sites.

Differential requirement for irf8 in formation of embryonic and adult macrophages
in zebrafish.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) is critical for mammalian macrophage
development and innate immunity, but its role in teleost myelopoiesis remains
incompletely understood. In particular, genetic tools to analyze the role of Irf8
in zebrafish macrophage development at larval and adult stages are lacking. We
generated irf8 null mutants in zebrafish using TALEN-mediated targeting. Our
analysis defines different requirements for irf8 at different stages. irf8 is
required for formation of all macrophages during primitive and transient
definitive hematopoiesis, but not during adult-phase definitive hematopoiesis
starting at 5-6 days postfertilization. At early stages, irf8 mutants have excess
neutrophils and excess cell death in pu.1-expressing myeloid cells. Macrophage
fates were recovered in irf8 mutants after wildtype irf8 expression in neutrophil
and macrophage lineages, suggesting that irf8 regulates macrophage specification 
and survival. In juvenile irf8 mutant fish, mature macrophages are present, but
at numbers significantly reduced compared to wildtype, indicating an ongoing
requirement for irf8 after embryogenesis. As development progresses, tissue
macrophages become apparent in zebrafish irf8 mutants, with the possible
exception of microglia. Our study defines distinct requirement for irf8 in
myelopoiesis before and after transition to the adult hematopoietic system.

Functions and development of red pulp macrophages.

Medicine, Yokohama, 236-0004.

Macrophages are extremely heterogeneous mononuclear phagocytes widely distributed
throughout the body. They play unique roles in each organ where they reside.
Among macrophage subsets, red pulp macrophages (RPMs) that localize in the
splenic red pulp, are critical for maintenance of blood homeostasis by actively
phagocytosing injured and senescent erythrocytes and blood-borne particulates.
Recent evidence indicates that RPMs are mainly generated during embryogenesis and
are maintained during adult life. Furthermore, the cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic 
factors (namely, Spi-C, IRF8/4, heme oxygenase-1, and M-CSF) that regulate the
development and survival of RPMs have been identified. Although the immunological
properties of RPMs have yet to be elucidated fully, pioneering studies have
demonstrated that these cells are capable of inducing differentiation of
regulatory T cells via expression of transforming growth factor-ß and secrete a
large amount of type I interferons during parasitic infections. In this review,
we describe recent advances in understanding of the functions and development of 
RPMs.

neutrophil vs monocyte production.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a key regulator of myelopoiesis in mice 
and humans. IRF8-deficient mice exhibit increased neutrophil numbers but
defective monocyte and dendritic cell (DC) production. It has therefore been
hypothesized that IRF8 regulates granulocyte vs monocyte/DC lineage commitment by
oligopotent progenitors. Alternatively, IRF8 could control the differentiation of
lineage-committed progenitors. In this study, we defined the role of IRF8 in
lineage commitment and neutrophil vs monocyte differentiation using a novel
sorting strategy that for the first time allows us to separate oligopotent
granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and their lineage-committed progeny:
granulocyte progenitors (GPs) and monocyte progenitors (MPs). We show that IRF8
is highly expressed by both GPs and MPs, but not GMPs, and is not required for GP
or MP production by GMPs. In fact, IRF8-deficient mice have more GPs and MPs.
This is not due to IRF8-mediated suppression of GP and MP production by GMPs, but
rather to selective effects in GPs and MPs. We identify roles for IRF8 in
regulating progenitor survival and differentiation and preventing leukemic cell
accumulation. Thus, IRF8 does not regulate granulocytic vs monocytic fate in
GMPs, but instead acts downstream of lineage commitment to selectively control
neutrophil and monocyte production.

A Comprehensive Profile of ChIP-Seq-Based PU.1/Spi1 Target Genes in Microglia.

Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan.

Microglia are resident mononuclear phagocytes that play a principal role in the
maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS).
Microglia, rapidly activated in response to proinflammatory stimuli, are
accumulated in brain lesions of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's
disease and Parkinson's disease. The E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family
transcription factor PU.1/Spi1 acts as a master regulator of myeloid and lymphoid
development. PU.1-deficient mice show a complete loss of microglia, indicating
that PU.1 plays a pivotal role in microgliogenesis. However, the comprehensive
profile of PU.1/Spi1 target genes in microglia remains unknown. By analyzing a
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) dataset
numbered SRP036026 with the Strand NGS program, we identified 5,264 Spi1 target
protein-coding genes in BV2 mouse microglial cells. They included Spi1, Irf8,
Runx1, Csf1r, Csf1, Il34, Aif1 (Iba1), Cx3cr1, Trem2, and Tyrobp. By motif
analysis, we found that the PU-box consensus sequences were accumulated in the
genomic regions surrounding ChIP-Seq peaks. By using pathway analysis tools of
bioinformatics, we found that ChIP-Seq-based Spi1 target genes show a significant
relationship with diverse pathways essential for normal function of
monocytes/macrophages, such as endocytosis, Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis,
and lysosomal degradation. These results suggest that PU.1/Spi1 plays a crucial
role in regulation of the genes relevant to specialized functions of microglia.
Therefore, aberrant regulation of PU.1 target genes might contribute to the
development of neurodegenerative diseases with accumulation of activated
microglia.

IRF4 and IRF8: Governing the virtues of B Lymphocytes.

Shukla V(1), Lu R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy. University of Nebraska Medical
Center, Omaha, NE 68198.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) and IRF8 are critical regulators of immune 
system development and function. In B lymphocytes, IRF4 and IRF8 have been shown 
to control important events during their development and maturation including
pre-B cell differentiation, induction of B cell tolerance pathways, marginal zone
B cell development, germinal center reaction and plasma cell differentiation.
Mechanistically, IRF4 and IRF8 are found to function redundantly to control
certain stages of B cell development, but in other stages, they function
nonredundantly to play distinct roles in B cell biology. In line with their
essential roles in B cell development, deregulated expressions of IRF4 and IRF8
have been associated to the pathogenesis of several B cell malignancies and
diseases. Recent studies have elucidated diverse transcriptional networks
regulated by IRF4 and IRF8 at distinct B cell developmental stages and related
malignancies. In this review we will discuss the recent advances for the roles of
IRF4 and IRF8 during B cell development and associated diseases.

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of metastasis through upregulation of immune surveillance 
is a major purpose of chemokine gene therapy. In this study, we focused on a
membrane-bound chemokine CXCL16, which has shown a correlation with a good
prognosis for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
METHODS: We generated a CXCL16-expressing metastatic CRC cell line and identified
changes in TNF and apoptosis-related factors. To investigate the effect of CXCL16
on colorectal liver metastasis, we injected SL4-Cont and SL4-CXCL16 cells into
intraportal vein in C57BL/6 mice and evaluated the metastasis. Moreover, we
analyzed metastatic liver tissues using flow cytometry whether CXCL16 expression 
regulates the infiltration of M1 macrophages.
RESULTS: CXCL16 expression enhanced TNF-a-induced apoptosis through activation of
PARP and the caspase-3-mediated apoptotic pathway and through inactivation of the
NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated survival pathway. Several genes were changed by CXCL16 expression,
but we focused on IRF8, which is a regulator of apoptosis and the metastatic
phenotype. We confirmed CXCL16 expression in SL4-CXCL16 cells and the correlation
between CXCL16 and IRF8. Silencing of IRF8 significantly decreased TNF-a-induced 
apoptosis. Liver metastasis of SL4-CXCL16 cells was also inhibited by
TNF-a-induced apoptosis through the induction of M1 macrophages, which released
TNF-a. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of M1 macrophages and the
enhancement of apoptosis by CXCL16 might be an effective dual approach against
CRC liver metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study revealed that CXCL16 regulates immune
surveillance and cell signaling. Therefore, we provide the first evidence of
CXCL16 serving as an intracellular signaling molecule.

Signal integration between IFN<U+03B3> and TLRs in immune cells has been associated with
the host defense against pathogens and injury, with a predominant role of STAT1. 
We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in vascular cells
involved in cross-talk between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4, reflect pro-atherogenic responses
in human atherosclerosis. Genome-wide investigation identified a set of
STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between 
IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4 in VSMCs. These included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccrl2, 
Cxcl10 and Ccl5, adhesion molecules Cd40, Cd74, and antiviral and antibacterial
genes Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Among the amplified
genes was also Irf8, of which Ccl5 was subsequently identified as a new
pro-inflammatory target in VSMCs and ECs. Promoter analysis predicted
transcriptional cooperation between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NF<U+03BA>B, with the novel
role of IRF8 providing an additional layer to the overall complexity. The
synergistic interactions between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4 also resulted in increased T-cell 
migration and impaired aortic contractility in a STAT1-dependent manner.
Expression of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlated with STAT1
phosphorylation in vascular cells in plaques from human carotid arteries.
Moreover, using data mining of human plaque transcriptomes, expression of a
selection of these STAT1-dependent pro-atherogenic genes was found to be
increased in coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis. Our study
provides evidence to suggest that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1 orchestrates a platform 
for cross-talk between IFN<U+03B3> and TLR4, and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene
signature that reflects a pro-atherogenic state in human atherosclerosis.

During hematopoiesis, cells originating from the same stem cell reservoir
differentiate into distinct cell types. The mechanisms enabling common
progenitors to differentiate into alternative cell fates are not fully
understood. Here, we identify cell-fate-determining transcription factors (TFs)
governing dendritic cell (DC) development by annotating the enhancer landscapes
of the DC lineage. Combining these analyses with detailed overexpression,
knockdown, and ChIP-Seq studies, we show that Irf8 functions as a plasmacytoid DC
epigenetic and fate-determining TF, regulating massive, cell-specific chromatin
changes in thousands of pDC enhancers. Importantly, Irf8 forms a negative
feedback loop with Cebpb, a monocyte-derived DC epigenetic fate-determining TF.
We show that using this circuit logic, a pulse of TF expression can stably define
epigenetic and transcriptional states, regardless of the microenvironment. More
broadly, our study proposes a general paradigm that allows closely related cells 
with a similar set of signal-dependent factors to generate differential and
persistent enhancer landscapes.

Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare condition
characterized by predisposition to clinical disease caused by weakly virulent
mycobacteria, such as BCG vaccines and environmental mycobacteria, in otherwise
healthy individuals with no overt abnormalities in routine hematological and
immunological tests. MSMD designation does not recapitulate all the clinical
features, as patients are also prone to salmonellosis, candidiasis and
tuberculosis, and more rarely to infections with other intramacrophagic bacteria,
fungi, or parasites, and even, perhaps, a few viruses. Since 1996, nine
MSMD-causing genes, including seven autosomal (IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1, IL12B,
IL12RB1, ISG15, and IRF8) and two X-linked (NEMO, and CYBB) genes have been
discovered. The high level of allelic heterogeneity has already led to the
definition of 18 different disorders. The nine gene products are physiologically 
related, as all are involved in IFN-<U+03B3>-dependent immunity. These disorders impair 
the production of (IL12B, IL12RB1, IRF8, ISG15, NEMO) or the response to (IFNGR1,
IFNGR2, STAT1, IRF8, CYBB) IFN-<U+03B3>. These defects account for only about half the
known MSMD cases. Patients with MSMD-causing genetic defects may display other
infectious diseases, or even remain asymptomatic. Most of these inborn errors do 
not show complete clinical penetrance for the case-definition phenotype of MSMD. 
We review here the genetic, immunological, and clinical features of patients with
inborn errors of IFN-<U+03B3>-dependent immunity.

It is well understood that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within tumors
typically do not maintain cytotoxic T cell (CTL) function, despite engaging them.
Across multiple mouse tumor models and human tumor biopsies, we have delineated
the intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) populations as distinct from macrophage
populations. Within these, CD103(+) DCs are extremely sparse and yet remarkably
capable CTL stimulators. These are uniquely dependent on IRF8, Zbtb46, and Batf3 
transcription factors and are generated by GM-CSF and FLT3L cytokines. Regressing
tumors have higher proportions of these cells, T-cell-dependent immune clearance 
relies on them, and abundance of their transcripts in human tumors correlates
with clinical outcome. This cell type presents opportunities for prognostic and
therapeutic approaches across multiple cancer types.

IL-12 and IL-17 by acting on Gsa in CD11b<U+207A> DCs.

Despite an extensive literature on the mechanism of action of cholera toxin (CT),
we still lack critical information about how the toxin acts as an adjuvant and,
especially, which dendritic cells (DCs) are the target cells. Although a T helper
type 2 (Th2)-skewing effect of CT is most commonly reported, effective priming of
Th17 cells as well as suppression of Th1 responses are well documented. However, 
the ability of CT to block interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) function and
interleukin (IL)-12 production in DCs, which blocks CD8a DC and Th1 cell
development, is inconsistent with priming of Th1 and CD8 T cells in many other
reports. This prompted us to investigate the adjuvant effect of CT in wild-type, 
IL-12p40-/-, Batf3-/-, and IL-17A-/- mice and in mice that selectively lack the
Gsa target protein for CT adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation in DCs. We
found that CT promoted Th1 priming independently of IL-12, and whereas Th2 and
also Th17 responses were augmented, the gut IgA responses did not require IL-17A.
Adjuvanticity was intact in Batf3-/- mice, lacking CD8a(+) DCs, but completely
lost in mice with Gsa-deficient CD11c cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that the 
adjuvant effect requires Gsa expression in CD11b(+) DCs, and that priming of
mucosal IgA and CD4 T cells appears unbiased and is independent of IL-12 and
IL-17A.

Beta-catenin signaling has recently been tied to the emergence of tolerogenic
dendritic cells (DCs). In this article, we demonstrate a novel role for
beta-catenin in directing DC subset development through IFN regulatory factor 8
(IRF8) activation. We found that splenic DC precursors express beta-catenin, and 
DCs from mice with CD11c-specific constitutive beta-catenin activation
upregulated IRF8 through targeting of the Irf8 promoter, leading to in vivo
expansion of IRF8-dependent CD8a+, plasmacytoid, and CD103+ CD11b2 DCs.
beta-cateninstabilized CD8a+ DCs secreted elevated IL-12 upon in vitro microbial
stimulation, and pharmacological beta-catenin inhibition blocked this response in
wild-type cells. Upon infections with Toxoplasma gondii and vaccinia virus, mice 
with stabilized DC beta-catenin displayed abnormally high Th1 and CD8+ T
lymphocyte responses, respectively. Collectively, these results reveal a novel
and unexpected function for beta-catenin in programming DC differentiation toward
subsets that orchestrate proinflammatory immunity to infection.

Basophils and mast cells play critical roles in host defense against pathogens
and allergic disorders. However, the molecular mechanism by which these cells are
generated is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that interferon
regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), a transcription factor essential for the development 
of several myeloid lineages, also regulates basophil and mast cell development.
Irf8(-/-) mice displayed a severe reduction in basophil counts, which was
accounted for by the absence of pre-basophil and mast cell progenitors
(pre-BMPs). Although Irf8(-/-) mice retained peripheral tissue mast cells,
remaining progenitors from Irf8(-/-) mice including granulocyte progenitors (GPs)
were unable to efficiently generate either basophils or mast cells, indicating
that IRF8 also contributes to the development of mast cells. IRF8 appeared to
function at the GP stage, because IRF8 was expressed in GPs, but not in
basophils, mast cells, and basophil/mast cell-restricted progenitor cells.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GATA2, a transcription factor known to promote
basophil and mast cell differentiation, acts downstream of IRF8. These results
shed light on the pathways and mechanism underlying the development of basophils 
and mast cells.

The stilbene derivative
(Z)-2-(2-bromophenyl)-3-{[4-(1-methylpiperazine)amino]phenyl}acrylonitrile
(DG172) was developed as a highly selective inhibitory peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)ß/d ligand. Here, we describe a novel
PPARß/d-independent, yet highly specific, effect of DG172 on the differentiation 
of bone marrow cells (BMCs). DG172 strongly augmented
granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced differentiation
of primary BMCs from Ppard null mice into two specific populations, characterized
as mature (CD11c(hi)MHCII(hi)) and immature (CD11c(hi)MHCII(lo)) dendritic cells 
(DCs). IL-4 synergized with DG172 to shift the differentiation from MHCII(lo)
cells to mature DCs in vitro. The promotion of DC differentiation occurred at the
expense of differentiation to granulocytic Gr1(+)Ly6B(+) cells. In agreement with
these findings, transcriptome analyses showed a strong DG172-mediated repression 
of genes encoding neutrophilic markers in both differentiating wild-type and
Ppard null cells, while macrophage/DC marker genes were up-regulated. DG172 also 
inhibited the expression of transcription factors driving granulocytic
differentiation (Cebpe, Gfi1, and Klf5), and increased the levels of
transcription factors promoting macrophage/DC differentiation (Irf4, Irf8, Spib, 
and Spic). DG172 exerted these effects only at an early stage of BMC
differentiation induced by GM-CSF, did not affect macrophage-colony-stimulating
factor-triggered differentiation to macrophages and had no detectable
PPARß/d-independent effect on other cell types tested. Structure-function
analyses demonstrated that the 4-methylpiperazine moiety in DG172 is required for
its effect on DC differentiation, but is dispensable for PPARß/d binding. Based
on these data we developed a new compound,
(Z)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-[4-(4-methylpiperazine-1-yl)phenyl]acrylonitrile
(DG228), which enhances DC differentiation in the absence of significant PPARß/d 
binding.

B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) corepressor (BCOR) was discovered as a BCL6-interacting 
corepressor, but little is known about its other biological activities in normal 
B cell development and function. Previously, we found that interferon regulatory 
factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon consensus sequence-binding protein,
directly targets a large number of genes in germinal center B cells including
BCL6. In this study, we screened potential binding partners of IRF8 using a
retrovirus-based protein complementation assay screen in a mouse pre-B cell line.
We found that IRF8 interacts directly with BCOR and that the a-helical region of 
IRF8 and the BCL6 binding domain of BCOR are required for this interaction. In
addition, IRF8 protein interacts directly with BCL6. Using an siRNA-mediated IRF8
knockdown mouse B cell lymphoma cell line, we showed that IRF8 represses Bcor and
enhances Bcl6 transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that a complex
comprising BCOR-BCL6-IRF8 modulates BCL6-associated transcriptional regulation of
germinal center B cell function.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a fibrotic and autoimmune disease characterized
clinically by skin and internal organ fibrosis and vascular damage, and
serologically by the presence of circulating autoantibodies. Although
etiopathogenesis is not yet well understood, the results of numerous genetic
association studies support genetic contributions as an important factor to SSc. 
In this paper, the major genes of SSc are reviewed. The most recent genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are taken into account along with robust candidate
gene studies. The literature search was performed on genetic association studies 
of SSc in PubMed between January 2000 and March 2014 while eligible studies
generally had over 600 total participants with replication. A few genetic
association studies with related functional changes in SSc patients were also
included. A total of forty seven genes or specific genetic regions were reported 
to be associated with SSc, although some are controversial. These genes include
HLA genes, STAT4, CD247, TBX21, PTPN22, TNFSF4, IL23R, IL2RA, IL-21,
SCHIP1/IL12A, CD226, BANK1, C8orf13-BLK, PLD4, TLR-2, NLRP1, ATG5, IRF5, IRF8,

KIAA0319, PSD3 and PSOR1C1. These genes encode proteins mainly involved in immune
regulation and inflammation, and some of them function in transcription, kinase
activity, DNA cleavage and repair. The discovery of various SSc-associated genes 
is important in understanding the genetics of SSc and potential pathogenesis that
contribute to the development of this disease.

Activated B cells undergo immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR) and
differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The distinct transcriptomes
of B cells and plasma cells are maintained by the antagonistic influences of two 
groups of transcription factors: those that maintain the B cell program,
including BCL6 and PAX5, and plasma cell-promoting factors, such as IRF4 and
BLIMP-1. We show that the complex of IRF8 and PU.1 controls the propensity of B
cells to undergo CSR and plasma cell differentiation by concurrently promoting
the expression of BCL6 and PAX5 and repressing AID and BLIMP-1. As the PU.1-IRF8 
complex functions in a reciprocal manner to IRF4, we propose that
concentration-dependent competition between these factors controls B cell
terminal differentiation.

IRF8 (interferon-regulatory factor-8) plays a critical role in regulating myeloid
cell differentiation. However, the role of this transcription factor in the
development of Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes and their migration to the infected
brain has not been examined. We have previously shown that West Nile virus (WNV) 
infection of wild-type (WT) mice triggers a significant increase in numbers of
Ly6C+ monocytes in the bone marrow. These cells traffic via the blood to the
infected brain, where they give rise to proinflammatory macrophages. Here, we
show that WNV-infected IRF8-deficient (IRF8-/-) mice had significantly reduced
numbers of Ly6C+ monocytes in the periphery, with few of these cells found in the
blood. Furthermore, low numbers of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages were
observed in the brains of IRF8-/- mice throughout infection. Adoptive transfer of
IRF8-/- Ly6C+ monocytes demonstrated that these cells were intrinsically unable
to traffic to the inflamed brain. Low expression of the chemokine receptor CCR2
and integrin VLA-4 by IRF8-/- monocytes likely contributed to this defect, as the
interactions between these proteins and their ligands are critical for monocyte
egress and migration to inflammatory foci. These data highlight a critical role
for IRF8 in inflammatory monocyte differentiation and migration during WNV
infection.

We investigated the role of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) in a model of
chronic pain in which repeated cold stress (RCS) exposure produces tactile
allodynia. RCS exposure produced a decrease in paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to 
mechanical stimulation. Spinal microglia of RCS-exposed mice were morphologically
activated. Expression of IRF8 was significantly increased in the spinal cord of
RCS-exposed mice and was localized in microglia. IRF8-knockout mice failed to
show the RCS-induced decrease in PWT. Thus, RCS exposure activates spinal
microglia and upregulation of IRF8 in these cells is involved in the development 
of tactile allodynia after RCS exposure.

BACKGROUND: X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 1 (XLP1) belongs to
genetically determined primary immunodeficiency syndromes with mutations in
SH2D1A/DSHP/SAP gene. The dramatic increase of the risk of B-cell lymphoma
development in XLP1 patients is linked not only to SAP deficiency of NK, NKT and 
T cells, but probably to the impairment of B cell differentiation.
AIM: To analyze the receptor-mediated Akt/PKB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
expression of transcription factors that are involved in B cell maturation in
EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs) from XLP1 patients (XLP
B-LCLs) in comparison with conventional B-LCLs.
METHODS: Studies were performed on EBV-transformed XLP B-LCLs IARC 739, SC-XLP
and RP-XLP in comparison with SAP-negative B-LCL T5-1 and SAP-positive B-LCL
MP-1. Western blot analysis was used for evaluation of Akt (Ser473) and ERK1/2
(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation in response to ligation of CD150, CD40, and IgM
cell surface receptors. The expression levels of transcription factors IRF4,
IRF8, BCL6, BLIMP1, SPIB, PU.1 and MITF were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR.
RESULTS: It was shown that SAP deficiency in XLP B-LCL did not abrogate
CD150-mediated Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. At the same time, ligation of
CD150 or IgM affects kinetics and amplitude of ERK1/2 activation. In XLP B-LCL
the CD150 signaling with IgM coligation play the dominant role in both Akt and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We found that significantly reduced IRF4, IRF8 and PU.1
expression levels are the key features of XLP B-LCLs.
CONCLUSION: XLP B-LCLs and conventional B-LCLs have differences in kinetics and
amplitude of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Analysis of transcription factors
profile revealed the distinguishing features of XLP B-LCLs with SAP deficiency
that may impair B cell differentiation.Key Words: B-lymphoblastoid cell lines,
X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 1, CD150, CD40, BCR, Akt/PKB, ERK1/2,
transcription factors.

Wales , Sydney, Australia .

The therapeutic efficacy of interferons (IFNs) in ulcerative colitis is minimal. 
However, IFN activity-associated molecules have been inadequately investigated.
Appendicitis and appendectomy (AA), when done while young, protect against
colitis development later. Our novel murine AA model protects against colitis.
This therapeutic target-identifying study enumerates IFN activity-associated
molecules involved in this protection. Mice with 2 laparotomies were controls
(sham-sham/SS). Distal colons were harvested (4 AA-group colons and 4 SS-group
colons). Microarray-analysis/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction-validation was done from RNA from each (3-days/28-days-post-AA). Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to analyze distal colonic gene
sets associated with 46 IFN activity-related genes. More AA-upregulated gene sets
were associated with IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IRF7, IFI35, and IFI44 (False Discovery
Rate-FDR <5% and P<0.001), although only IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFI44 showed
individual gene upregulation (P<0.05). More AA-downregulated gene sets were
associated with IRF1, IRF2, IRF4, IRF8, IRF9, IRF2BP1, IFRD1, IFRD2, and IFIH1
(FDR <5%/P<0.001); although only IRF2BP1 showed individual gene downregulation
(P<0.05). There was significant upregulation (P<0.05) of IFNZ; and downregulation
of IRF2BP2 and IFI30, despite no major associated GSEA differences. IFIT1, IFIT2,
IFIT3, and IFI44, with profound AA-induced individual/GSEA upregulation, and
their immunomodulatory/ antiproliferative activity, are the best molecules to
investigate therapeutic potential. IRF4, IRF8, IRF2BP1, IFRD1, and IFRD2, owing
to their profound AA-induced gene set downregulation, and because of their
diverse lymphocytic activity, are good targets to competitively inhibit or to
treat with exogenous products in knockout animals.

Myeloid progenitors lose their potential to generate neutrophils when they adopt 
the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. The mechanism underlying this lineage
restriction remains unknown. We here report that the protein expression of IRF8, 
an essential transcription factor for the development of dendritic cells (DCs)
and monocytes, sharply increases at the monocyte-DC progenitor (MDP) stage and
remains high in common monocyte progenitors (cMoPs). Irf8(-/-) MDPs and cMoPs
accumulate but fail to efficiently generate their downstream populations, instead
giving rise to neutrophils in vivo. IRF8 physically interacts with the
transcription factor C/EBPa and prevents its binding to chromatin in MDPs and
cMoPs, blocking the ability of C/EBPa to stimulate transcription and neutrophil
differentiation. A partial inhibition of C/EBP activity in Irf8(-/-)
haematopoietic progenitors alleviates the neutrophil overproduction in vivo.
Thus, IRF8 not only bestows monocyte and DC differentiation potential upon
mononuclear phagocyte progenitors but also restrains these progenitors from
differentiating into neutrophils.

The brain is a vital organ and because it is well shielded from the outside
environment, possibilities for noninvasive analysis are often limited. Instead,
fluids taken from the spinal cord or circulatory system are preferred sources for
the discovery of candidate markers within neurological diseases. In the context
of multiple sclerosis (MS), we applied an affinity proteomic strategy and
screened 22 plasma samples with 4595 antibodies (3450 genes) on bead arrays, then
defined 375 antibodies (334 genes) for targeted analysis in a set of 172 samples 
and finally used 101 antibodies (43 genes) on 443 plasma as well as 573
cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) samples. This revealed alteration of protein
profiles in relation to MS subtypes for IRF8, IL7, METTL14, SLC30A7, and GAP43.
Respective antibodies were subsequently used for immunofluorescence on human
post-mortem brain tissue with MS pathology for expression and association
analysis. There, antibodies for IRF8, IL7, and METTL14 stained neurons in
proximity of lesions, which highlighted these candidate protein targets for
further studies within MS and brain tissue. The affinity proteomic translation of
profiles discovered by profiling human body fluids and tissue provides a powerful
strategy to suggest additional candidates to studies of neurological disorders.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions
characterized by dysfunction in social interaction, communication and stereotypic
behavior. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the
development of ASD, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their interaction are
not clear. Epigenetic modifications have been suggested as molecular mechanism
that can mediate the interaction between the environment and the genome to
produce adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Here, using the Illumina 450<U+2009>K
methylation array we have determined the existence of many dysregulated CpGs in
two cortical regions, Brodmann area 10 (BA10) and Brodmann area 24 (BA24), of
individuals who had ASD. In BA10 we found a very significant enrichment for
genomic areas responsible for immune functions among the hypomethylated CpGs,
whereas genes related to synaptic membrane were enriched among hypermethylated
CpGs. By comparing our methylome data with previously published transcriptome
data, and by performing real-time PCR on selected genes that were dysregulated in
our study, we show that hypomethylated genes are often overexpressed, and that
there is an inverse correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation
within the individuals. Among these genes there were C1Q, C3, ITGB2 (C3R), TNF-a,
IRF8 and SPI1, which have recently been implicated in synaptic pruning and
microglial cell specification. Finally, we determined the epigenetic
dysregulation of the gene HDAC4, and we confirm that the locus encompassing
C11orf21/TSPAN32 has multiple hypomethylated CpGs in the autistic brain, as
previously demonstrated. Our data suggest a possible role for epigenetic
processes in the etiology of ASD.

Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA, jmb279@cornell.edu.

We investigated how the equine fetus prepares its pre-immune humoral repertoire
for an imminent exposure to pathogens in the neonatal period, particularly how
the primary hematopoietic organs are equipped to support B cell hematopoiesis and
immunoglobulin (Ig) diversity. We demonstrated that the liver and the bone marrow
at approximately 100 days of gestation (DG) are active sites of hematopoiesis
based on the expression of signature messenger RNA (mRNA) (c-KIT, CD34, IL7R,
CXCL12, IRF8, PU.1, PAX5, NOTCH1, GATA1, CEBPA) and protein markers (CD34, CD19, 
IgM, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD11b, CD172A) of hematopoietic development and
leukocyte differentiation molecules, respectively. To verify Ig diversity
achieved during the production of B cells, V(D)J segments were sequenced in
primary lymphoid organs of the equine fetus and adult horse, revealing that
similar heavy chain VDJ segments and CDR3 lengths were most frequently used
independent of life stage. In contrast, different lambda light chain segments
were predominant in equine fetal compared to adult stage, and surprisingly, the
fetus had less restricted use of variable gene segments to construct the lambda
chain. Fetal Igs also contained elements of sequence diversity, albeit to a
smaller degree than that of the adult horse. Our data suggest that the B cells
produced in the liver and bone marrow of the equine fetus generate a wide
repertoire of pre-immune Igs for protection, and the more diverse use of
different lambda variable gene segments in fetal life may provide the neonate an 
opportunity to respond to a wider range of antigens at birth.

DC-STAMP is a key regulating molecule of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast
precursor (OCP) fusion. Emerging lines of evidence showed that microRNAs play
crucial roles in bone metabolism and osteoclast differentiation, but no microRNA 
has yet been reported to be directly related to OCPs fusion. Through a
microarray, we found that the expression of miR-7b in RAW264.7 cells was
significantly decreased after induction with M-CSF and RANKL. The overexpression 
of miR-7b in RAW264.7 cells attenuated the number of TRAP-positive cells number
and the formation of multinucleated cells, whereas the inhibition of miR-7b
enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Through a dual luciferase reporter assay, we
confirmed that miR-7b directly targets DC-STAMP. Other fusogenic molecules, such 
as CD47, ATP6v0d2, and OC-STAMP, were detected to be down-regulated in accordance
with the inhibition of DC-STAMP. Because DC-STAMP also participates in osteoclast
differentiation through the ITAM-ITIM network, multiple osteoclast-specific genes
in the ITAM-ITIM network were detected to identify how DC-STAMP is involved in
this process. The results showed that molecules associated with the ITAM-ITIM
network, such as NFATc1 and OSCAR, which are crucial in osteoclastogenesis, were 
consistently altered due to DC-STAMP inhibition. These findings suggest that
miR-7b inhibits osteoclastogenesis and cell-cell fusion by directly targeting
DC-STAMP. In addition, the inhibition of DC-STAMP and its downstream signals
changed the expression of other fusogenic genes and key regulating genes, such as
Nfatc1, c-fos, Akt, Irf8, Mapk1, and Traf6. In conclusion, our findings indicate 
that miR-7b may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
osteoclast-related bone disorders.

We have previously reported on a unique patient in whom homozygosity for a
mutation at IRF8 (IRF8(K108E)) causes a severe immunodeficiency. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a highly unusual myeloid compartment, remarkable for the
complete absence of CD141 and CD161 monocytes, absence of CD11c1 conventional
dendritic cells (DCs) and CD11c1/CD1231 plasmacytoid DCs, and striking
granulocytic hyperplasia. The patient initially presented with severe
disseminated mycobacterial and mucocutaneous fungal infections and was ultimately
cured by cord blood transplant. Sequencing RNA from the IRF8(K108E) patient's
primary blood cells prior to transplant shows not only depletion of IRF8-bound
and IRF8-regulated transcriptional targets, in keeping with the distorted
composition of the myeloid compartment, but also a paucity of transcripts
associated with activated CD41 and CD81 T lymphocytes. This suggests that T cells
reared in the absence of a functional antigen-presenting compartment in
IRF8(K108E) are anergic. Biochemical characterization of the IRF8(K108E) mutant
in vitro shows that loss of the positively charged side chain at K108 causes loss
of nuclear localization and loss of transcriptional activity, which is
concomitant with decreased protein stability, increased ubiquitination, increased
small ubiquitin-like modification, and enhanced proteasomal degradation. These
findings provide functional insight into the molecular basis of immunodeficiency 
associated with loss of IRF8.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the aberrant methylation and
altered expression of the interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) gene in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pyrosequencing assays were performed on 191 tumor
specimens from NSCLC patients. The changes in IRF8 mRNA expression, prior to and 
following treatment with a demethylating agent and methylation itself, were
examined in 13 lung cancer cell lines by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) and pyrosequencing. IRF8 protein expression was examined in 94 of the 191 
NSCLC specimens by immunohistochemical analysis. The IRF8 methylation level was
significantly higher in the tumor tissues than in matched non-malignant lung
tissues (P<0.0001). IRF8 was more frequently methylated in tumor tissues compared
with matched non-malignant lung tissues, as defined by a predetermined cut-off
value (P<0.0001). The IRF8 methylation level was strongly correlated with the
change in mRNA expression in lung cancer cell lines and with the protein
expression level in primary tumors. The IRF8 gene was more frequently methylated 
in patients without an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation than in
patients with an EGFR mutation (P=0.015). IRF8 methylation correlated with
recurrent prognosis in adenocarcinomas (log-rank test, P=0.048). IRF8 protein
expression was frequently silenced in males, smokers, patients with
non-adenocarcinoma or with wild-type EGFR, or in an advanced stage. IRF8 is often
silenced by its methylation, which is a frequent event in NSCLC and, therefore,
methylation of IRF8 may act as a prognostic marker for recurrence. Analysis of
IRF8 methylation status may provide novel opportunities for improved prognosis
and therapy of resected NSCLC.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), as a central element of IFN-<U+03B3>-signaling,
plays a critical role in tumor suppression. However, its expression and
underlying molecular mechanism remain elusive in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Here, we examined IRF8 expression and methylation in RCC cell lines and primary
tumors, and further assessed its tumor suppressive functions. We found that IRF8 
was widely expressed in human normal tissues including kidney, but frequently
downregulated by promoter methylation in RCC cell lines. IRF8 methylation was
detected in 25% of primary tumors, but not in adjacent non-malignant renal
tissues, and associated with higher tumor nuclear grade of RCC. Ectopic
expression of IRF8 inhibited colony formation and migration abilities of RCC
cells, through inducing cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis. IFN-<U+03B3> could induce 
IRF8 expression in RCC cells, together with increased cleaved-PARP. We further
found that IRF8 inhibited expression of oncogenes YAP1 and Survivin, as well as
upregulated expression of tumor suppressor genes CASP1, p21 and PTEN.
Collectively, our data demonstrate that IRF8 as a functional tumor suppressor is 
frequently methylated in RCC, and IRF8-mediated interferon signaling is involved 
in RCC pathogenesis.

Multiple subsets of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L)-dependent dendritic
cells (DCs) control T-cell tolerance and immunity. In mice, Batf3-dependent
CD103(+) DCs efficiently enter lymph nodes and cross-present antigens, rendering 
this conserved DC subset a promising target for tolerance induction or
vaccination. However, only limited numbers of CD103(+) DCs can be isolated with
current methods. Established bone marrow culture protocols efficiently generate
monocyte-derived DCs or produce a mixture of FLT3L-dependent DC subsets. We show 
that CD103(+) DC development requires prolonged culture time and continuous
action of both FLT3L and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), explained by a dual effect of GM-CSF on DC precursors and
differentiating CD103(+) DCs. Accordingly, we established a novel method to
generate large numbers of CD103(+) DCs (iCD103-DCs) with limited presence of
other DC subsets. iCD103-DCs develop in a Batf3- and Irf8-dependent fashion,
express a CD8a/CD103 DC gene signature, cross-present cell-associated antigens,
and respond to TLR3 stimulation. Thus, iCD103-DCs reflect key features of tissue 
CD103(+) DCs. Importantly, iCD103-DCs express high levels of CCR7 upon maturation
and migrate to lymph nodes more efficiently than classical monocyte-derived DCs. 
Finally, iCD103-DCs induce T cell-mediated protective immunity in vivo. Our study
provides insights into CD103(+) DC development and function.

Alterations in DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood leukocytes precede
atherosclerotic lesion development in mouse models of atherosclerosis and have
been linked to cardiovascular death in patients. The aim of this study is to
investigate the long-term changes induced by WTD feeding on BM cells and the
consequences for atherosclerosis susceptibility. Hereto, WTD BM or Chow BM was
transplanted into LDLR KO mice on chow. BM from WTD BM recipient mice exhibited
hypomethylation of CpG regions in the genes encoding Pu.1 and IRF8, key
regulators of monocyte proliferation and macrophage differentiation. In
agreement, in blood, the numbers of leukocytes were 40% (P<0.05) higher as a
result of an increase in F4/80(+) monocytes (3.4-fold; P<0.01). An increase of
CD11c(++) cells was also found (2.4-fold; P<0.05). Furthermore, spleens were
enlarged, and the percentage of F4/80(+) cells expressing CD86 was induced
(1.8-fold; P<0.01), indicating increased activation of splenic macrophages.
Importantly, mice reconstituted with WTD BM showed a significant, 1.4-fold
(P<0.05) increase in aortic root plaque size in the absence of changes in serum
cholesterol. We conclude that WTD challenge induces transplantable epigenetic
changes in BM, alterations in the hematopoietic system, and increased
susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Manipulation of the epigenome, when used in
conjunction with blood lipid reduction, could thus prove beneficial to treat
cardiovascular disorders.

The IFN regulatory factor family member 8 (IRF8) regulates differentiation of
lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells by promoting or suppressing lineage-specific
genes. How IRF8 promotes hematopoietic progenitors to commit to one lineage while
preventing the development of alternative lineages is not known. In this study,
we report an IRF8-EGFP fusion protein reporter mouse that revealed previously
unrecognized patterns of IRF8 expression. Differentiation of hematopoietic stem
cells into oligopotent progenitors is associated with progressive increases in
IRF8-EGFP expression. However, significant induction of IRF8-EGFP is found in
granulocyte-myeloid progenitors and the common lymphoid progenitors but not the
megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors. Surprisingly, IRF8-EGFP identifies three
subsets of the seemingly homogeneous granulocyte-myeloid progenitors with an
intermediate level of expression of EGFP defining bipotent progenitors that
differentiation into either EGFP(hi) monocytic progenitors or EGFP(lo)
granulocytic progenitors. Also surprisingly, IRF8-EGFP revealed a highly
heterogeneous pre-pro-B population with a fluorescence intensity ranging from
background to 4 orders above background. Interestingly, IRF8-EGFP readily
distinguishes true B cell committed (EGFP(int)) from those that are noncommitted.
Moreover, dendritic cell progenitors expressed extremely high levels of
IRF8-EGFP. Taken together, the IRF8-EGFP reporter revealed previously
unrecognized subsets with distinct developmental potentials in phenotypically
well-defined oligopotent progenitors, providing new insights into the dynamic
heterogeneity of developing hematopoietic progenitors.

In the immunocompromised host, invasive infection with the fungal pathogen
Candida albicans is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Sporadic cases 
in otherwise normal individuals are rare, and they are thought to be associated
with genetic predisposition. Using a mouse model of systemic infection with C.
albicans, we identified the SM/J mouse strain as unusually susceptible to
infection. Genetic linkage studies in informative [C57BL/6JxSM/J]F2 mice
identified a major locus on distal chromosome 15, given the appellation Carg5,
that regulates C. albicans replication in SM/J mice. Cellular and molecular
immunophenotyping experiments, as well as functional studies in purified cell
populations from SM/J and C57BL/6J, and in [C57BL/6JxSM/J]F2 mice fixed for
homozygous or heterozygous Carg5 alleles, indicate that Carg5-regulated
susceptibility in SM/J is associated with a complex defect in the myeloid
compartment of these mice. SM/J neutrophils express lower levels of Ly6G, and
importantly, they show significantly reduced production of reactive oxygen
species in response to stimulation with fMLF and PMA. Likewise,
CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(hi) inflammatory monocytes were present at lower levels in
the blood of infected SM/J, recruited less efficiently at the site of infection, 
and displayed blunted oxidative burst. Studies in F2 mice establish strong
correlations between Carg5 alleles, Ly6G expression, production of serum CCL2
(MCP-1), and susceptibility to C. albicans. Genomic DNA sequencing of chromatin
immunoprecipitated for myeloid proinflammatory transcription factors IRF1, IRF8, 
STAT1 and NF-<U+03BA>B, as well as RNA sequencing, were used to develop a "myeloid
inflammatory score" and systematically analyze and prioritize potential candidate
genes in the Carg5 interval.

Myeloid differentiation is blocked in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the
molecular mechanisms are not well characterized. Meningioma 1 (MN1) is
overexpressed in AML patients and confers resistance to all-trans retinoic
acid-induced differentiation. To understand the role of MN1 as a transcriptional 
regulator in myeloid differentiation, we fused transcriptional activation (VP16) 
or repression (M33) domains with MN1 and characterized these cells in vivo.
Transcriptional activation of MN1 target genes induced myeloproliferative disease
with long latency and differentiation potential to mature neutrophils. A large
proportion of differentially expressed genes between leukemic MN1 and
differentiation-permissive MN1VP16 cells belonged to the immune response pathway 
like interferon-response factor (Irf) 8 and Ccl9. As MN1 is a cofactor of MEIS1
and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), we compared chromatin occupancy between 
these genes. Immune response genes that were upregulated in MN1VP16 cells were
co-targeted by MN1 and MEIS1, but not RARA, suggesting that myeloid
differentiation is blocked through transcriptional repression of shared target
genes of MN1 and MEIS1. Constitutive expression of Irf8 or its target gene Ccl9
identified these genes as potent inhibitors of murine and human leukemias in
vivo. Our data show that MN1 prevents activation of the immune response pathway, 
and suggest restoration of IRF8 signaling as therapeutic target in AML.

Increased risk of bone fractures is observed in patients with chronic
inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid
arthritis. Members of the Interferon Response Factor family of transcriptional
regulators, IRF1 and IRF8, have been identified as genetic risk factors for
several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We have investigated a
potential role for the Irf1 gene in bone metabolism. Here, we report that
Irf1(-/-) mutant mice show altered bone morphology in association with altered
trabecular bone architecture and increased cortical thickness and cellularity. Ex
vivo studies on cells derived from bone marrow stimulated with Rank ligand
revealed an increase in size and resorptive activity of tartrate-resistant
acid-positive cells from Irf1(-/-) mutant mice compared with wild-type control
mice. Irf1 deficiency was also associated with decreased proliferation of bone
marrow-derived osteoblast precursors ex vivo, concomitant with increased
mineralization activity compared with control cells. We show that Irf1 plays a
role in bone metabolism and suggest that Irf1 regulates the maturation and
activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The altered bone phenotype of Irf1(-/-) 
mutants is strikingly similar to that of Stat1(-/-) mice, suggesting that the two
interacting proteins play a critical enabling role in the common regulation of
these two cell lineages.

University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

OBJECTIVE: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding
interferon response factor (IRF)-5, IRF-8 and glypican-5 (GPC5) have been
associated with disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with
interferon (IFN)-ß. We analysed whether SNPs in the IRF5, IRF8 and GPC5 genes are
associated with clinical disease activity in MS patients beginning de novo
treatment with IFN-ß.
METHODS: The SNPs rs2004640, rs3807306 and rs4728142 in IRF5, rs13333054 and
rs17445836 in IRF8 and rs10492503 in GPC5 were genotyped in 575 patients with
relapsing-remitting MS followed prospectively after the initiation of their first
treatment with IFN-ß.
RESULTS: 62% of patients experienced relapses during the first 2 years of
treatment, and 32% had disability progression during the first 5 years of
treatment. Patients with a pretreatment annualized relapse rate >1 had an
increased risk of relapse (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.90) 
and progression (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.99) on
treatment and patients with breakthrough relapses in the form of relapses during 
the first 2 years of treatment had an increased risk of progression during the
first 5 years of treatment (hazard ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval
1.47-2.85).The gene variants in IRF5, IRF8 and GPC5 were not associated with risk
of relapse or disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment relapse rate and clinical disease activity during the
first 2 years of treatment may be associated with disease progression in MS
patients treated with IFN-ß. Genetic analysis of the studied gene variants do not
provide additional information.

Decreased interleukin 27 expression is associated with active uveitis in Behçet's
disease.

Wang C, Tian Y, Ye Z, Kijlstra A, Zhou Y, Yang P.

INSTRUCTION: Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is an important regulator of the
proinflammatory T-cell response. In this study, we investigated its role in the
pathogenesis of Behçet's disease (BD).
METHODS: IL-27 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined by
performing RT-PCRs. Cytokine levels in sera or supernatants of PBMCs, naïve
CD4(+) T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and DC/T cells were determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used RNA interference in naïve CD4(+) T
cells to study the role of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) in the
inhibitory effect of IL-27 on Th17 cell differentiation. Flow cytometry was used 
to evaluate the frequency of IL-17- and interferon <U+03B3>-producing T cells.
RESULTS: The expression of IL-27p28 mRNA by PBMCs and IL-27 in the sera and
supernatants of cultured PBMCs were markedly decreased in patients with active
BD. A higher frequency of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T (Th17) cells and increased
IL-17 production under Th17 polarizing conditions were observed in patients with 
active BD. IL-27 significantly inhibited Th17 cell differentiation.
Downregulation of IRF8 by RNA interference abrogated the suppressive effect of
IL-27 on Th17 differentiation. IL-27 inhibited the production of IL-1ß, IL-6 and 
IL-23, but promoted IL-10 production, by DCs. IL-27-treated DCs inhibited both
the Th1 and Th17 cell responses.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that a decreased IL-27
expression is associated with disease activity in BD patients. Low IL-27
expression may result in a higher Th1 and Th17 cell response and thereby promote 
the autoinflammatory reaction observed in BD. Manipulation of IL-27 may offer a
new treatment modality for this disease.

Polymorphisms in microRNA target sites modulate risk of lymphoblastic and myeloid
leukemias and affect microRNA binding.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNA dysregulation is a common event in leukemia. Polymorphisms
in microRNA-binding sites (miRSNPs) in target genes may alter the strength of
microRNA interaction with target transcripts thereby affecting protein levels. In
this study we aimed at identifying miRSNPs associated with leukemia risk and
assessing impact of these miRSNPs on miRNA binding to target transcripts.
METHODS: We analyzed with specialized algorithms the 3' untranslated regions of
137 leukemia-associated genes and identified 111 putative miRSNPs, of which 10
were chosen for further investigation. We genotyped patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>87), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>140), childhood acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>101) and healthy controls (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>471). Association
between SNPs and leukemia risk was calculated by estimating odds ratios in the
multivariate logistic regression analysis. For miRSNPs that were associated with 
leukemia risk we performed luciferase reporter assays to examine whether they
influence miRNA binding.
RESULTS: Here we show that variant alleles of TLX1_rs2742038 and ETV6_rs1573613
were associated with increased risk of childhood ALL (OR (95% CI)<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.97
(1.43-11.02) and 1.9 (1.16-3.11), respectively), while PML_rs9479 was associated 
with decreased ALL risk (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.55 (0.36-0.86). In adult myeloid leukemias we
found significant associations between the variant allele of PML_rs9479 and
decreased AML risk (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.61 (0.38-0.97), and between variant alleles of IRF8_
rs10514611 and ARHGAP26_rs187729 and increased CML risk (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.4 (1.12-5.15) and
1.63 (1.07-2.47), respectively). Moreover, we observed a significant trend for an
increasing ALL and CML risk with the growing number of risk genotypes with
OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>13.91 (4.38-44.11) for carriers of =3 risk genotypes in ALL and OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.9
(1.27-18.85) for carriers of 2 risk genotypes in CML. Luciferase reporter assays 
revealed that the C allele of ARHGAP26_rs187729 creates an illegitimate binding
site for miR-18a-3p, while the A allele of PML_rs9479 enhances binding of
miR-510-5p and the C allele of ETV6_rs1573613 weakens binding of miR-34c-5p and
miR-449b-5p.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study implicates that microRNA-binding site polymorphisms
modulate leukemia risk by interfering with the miRNA-mediated regulation. Our
findings underscore the significance of variability in 3' untranslated regions in
leukemia.

BACKGROUND: Microglial cells, which are resident macrophages of the central
nervous system, play important roles in immune responses and pathogenesis.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a neurotropic virus that infects microglial 
cells in brain. Several microRNAs including miR-155 and miR-146a play an
important role in defining the microglia inflammatory profile. In this study, we 
have investigated the effect of miR-155 and miR-146a modulation on JEV infection 
as well as innate immune responses in human microglial cells.
METHODS: In vitro studies were performed in JEV-infected human microglial CHME3
cells. miR-155 or miR-146a were overexpressed and total RNA and protein were
extracted following JEV-infection. Expression of genes involved in innate immune 
responses was studied by PCR array, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), western
blot and Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). JEV replication was monitored
by studying the viral RNA by qPCR, protein by western blot, and titres by plaque 
assay.
RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-155 in CHME3 cells resulted in significantly
reduced JEV replication whereas miR-146a overexpression had an insignificant
effect. Additionally, interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and complement factor
H (CFH) were induced during JEV infection; however, this induction was attenuated
in miR-155 overexpressing cells following JEV infection. Further, JEV-induced
NF-<U+03BA>B regulated downstream gene expression was attenuated. Interestingly, an
increased level of CD45, a negative regulator of microglia activation and a
reduced phosphorylated-Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription
(p-STAT1) expression was observed in miR-155 overexpressing cells upon JEV
infection.
CONCLUSION: Induction of miR-155 in human microglial cells may negatively
modulate JEV-induced innate immune gene expression and may have a beneficial role
in limiting JEV replication in human microglial cells.

In response to neuronal injury or disease, microglia adopt distinct reactive
phenotypes via the expression of different sets of genes. Spinal microglia
expressing the purinergic P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) after peripheral nerve injury
(PNI) are implicated in neuropathic pain. Here we show that interferon regulatory
factor-5 (IRF5), which is induced in spinal microglia after PNI, is responsible
for direct transcriptional control of P2X4R. Upon stimulation of microglia by
fibronectin, IRF5 induced de novo expression of P2X4R by directly binding to the 
promoter region of the P2rx4 gene. Mice lacking Irf5 did not upregulate spinal
P2X4R after PNI, and also exhibited substantial resistance to pain
hypersensitivity. Furthermore, we found that expression of IRF5 in microglia is
regulated by IRF8. Thus, an IRF8-IRF5 transcriptional axis may contribute to
shifting spinal microglia toward a P2X4R-expressing reactive state after PNI.
These results may provide a new target for treating neuropathic pain.

DCs develop from multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which commit into DC-restricted 
common dendritic cell progenitors (CDPs). CDPs further differentiate into
classical DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Here, we studied the impact of 
histone acetylation on DC development in C57BL/6 mice by interfering with histone
acetylation and deacetylation, employing histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.
We observed that commitment of MPPs into CDPs was attenuated by HDAC inhibition
and that pDC development was specifically blocked. Gene expression profiling
revealed that HDAC inhibition prevents establishment of a DC-specific gene
expression repertoire. Importantly, protein levels of the core DC transcription
factor PU.1 were reduced in HDAC inhibitor-treated cells and consequently PU.1
recruitment at PU.1 target genes Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), interferon
regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), and PU.1 itself was impaired. Thus, our results
demonstrate that attenuation of PU.1 expression by HDAC inhibition causes reduced
expression of key DC regulators, which results in attenuation of DC development. 
We propose that chromatin modifiers, such as HDACs, are required for establishing
a DC gene network, where Flt3/STAT3 signaling drives PU.1 and IRF8 expression and
DC development. Taken together, our study identifies HDACs as critical regulators
of DC lineage commitment and development.

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, are
constitutively mobile cells that undergo rapid directional movement toward sites 
of tissue disruption. However, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of
microglial motility remain unknown. In the present study, we show that interferon
regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) regulates microglial motility. We found that ATP and
complement component, C5a, induced chemotaxis of IRF8 wild-type microglia.
However, these responses were markedly suppressed in microglia lacking IRF8 (Irf8
(-/-)). In a consistent manner, phosphorylation of Akt (which plays a crucial
role in ATP-induced chemotaxis) was abolished in Irf8 (-/-)microglia. Real-time
polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that motility-related microglial
genes such as P2Y12 receptor were significantly suppressed in Irf8
(-/-)microglia. Furthermore, Irf8 (-/-)microglia exhibited a differential
expression pattern of nucleotide-degrading enzymes compared with their wild-type 
counterparts. Overall, our findings suggest that IRF8 may regulate microglial
motility via the control of microglial gene expression.

C/EBPa is required for the formation of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors;
however, its role in subsequent myeloid lineage specification remains uncertain. 
Transduction of murine marrow with either of two Cebpa shRNAs markedly increases 
monocyte and reduces granulocyte colonies in methylcellulose or the monocyte to
neutrophil ratio in liquid culture. Similar findings were found after marrow
shRNA transduction and transplantation and with CEBPA knockdown in human marrow
CD34+ cells. These results apparently reflect altered myeloid lineage
specification, as similar knockdown allowed nearly complete 32Dcl3 granulocytic
maturation. Cebpa knockdown also generated lineage-negative blasts with increased
colony replating capacity but unchanged cell cycle parameters, likely reflecting 
complete differentiation block. The shRNA having the greatest effect on lineage
skewing reduced Cebpa 3-fold in differentiating cells but 6-fold in accumulating 
blasts. Indicating that Cebpa is the relevant shRNA target, shRNA-resistant
C/EBPa-ER rescued marrow myelopoiesis. Cebpa knockdown in murine marrow cells
also increased in vitro erythropoiesis, perhaps reflecting 1.6-fold reduction in 
PU.1 leading to GATA-1 derepression. Global gene expression analysis of
lineage-negative blasts that accumulate after Cebpa knockdown demonstrated
reduction in Cebpe and Gfi1, known transcriptional regulators of granulopoiesis, 
and also reduced Ets1 and Klf5. Populations enriched for immature granulocyte or 
monocyte progenitor/precursors were isolated by sorting Lin-Sca-1-c-Kit+ cells
into GCSFR+MCSFR- or GCSFR-MCSFR+ subsets. Cebpa, Cebpe, Gfi1, Ets1, and Klf5
RNAs were increased in the c-Kit+GCSFR+ and Klf4 and Irf8 in the c-Kit+MCSFR+
populations, with PU.1 levels similar in both. In summary, higher levels of
C/EBPa are required for granulocyte and lower levels for monocyte lineage
specification, and this myeloid bifurcation may be facilitated by increased Cebpa
gene expression in granulocyte compared with monocyte progenitors.

The transcription factors IRF4 and IRF8 represent immune-specific members of the 
interferon regulatory family. They play major roles in controlling the
development and functioning of innate and adaptive cells. Genes encoding these
factors appear to have been coopted by the immune system via gene duplication and
divergence of regulatory and protein coding sequences to enable the acquisition
of unique molecular properties and functions. Unlike other members of the IRF
family, IRF4 and IRF8 do not activate transcription of Type 1 interferon genes or
positively regulate interferon-induced gene expression. Instead, they bind to
unusual composite Ets-IRF or AP-1-IRF elements with specific Ets or AP-1 family
transcription factors, respectively, and regulate the expression of diverse sets 
of immune response genes in innate as well as adaptive cells.

Monocyte development is a tightly regulated and multi-staged process, occurring
through several defined progenitor cell intermediates. The key transcription
factors, including PU.1, IRF8 and KLF4, growth factors, such as M-CSF and IL-34
and cytokines that drive monocyte development from hematopoietic progenitor cells
are well defined. However, the molecular controls that direct differentiation
into the Ly6C(hi) inflammatory and Ly6C(lo) monocyte subsets are yet to be
completely elucidated. This review will provide a summary of the transcriptional 
regulation of monocyte development. We will also discuss how these molecular
controls are also critical for microglial development despite their distinct
haematopoetic origins. Furthermore, we will examine recent breakthroughs in
defining mechanisms that promote differentiation of specific monocyte
subpopulations.

restrict myeloproliferative disorder.

Runx1 and Cbfß are critical for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and
are implicated in leukemic transformation. Despite the absolute requirements for 
these factors in the development of hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes,
their roles in the development of bone marrow progenitor subsets have not been
defined. Here, we demonstrate that Cbfß is essential for the development of
Flt3(+) macrophage-dendritic cell (DC) progenitors in the bone marrow and all DC 
subsets in the periphery. Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic
Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe
anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant
progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs),
resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the
periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription
factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression
of Irf8 restors DC differentiation. These results demonstrate that Runx proteins 
and Cbfß restrict granulocyte lineage commitment to facilitate multilineage
hematopoietic differentiation and thus identify their novel tumor suppressor
function in myeloid leukemia.

OBJECTIVE: To construct and identify recombinant adenovirus Ad-IRF8 carrying
mouse interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) and observe the influence of the
over-expressed IRF8 on the differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells
(RAW264.7) induced by soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor <U+03BA>B ligand
(sRANKL).
METHODS: Mouse IRF8 gene amplified by PCR was subcloned into the shuttle vector
pAdTrack-CMV. The vector pAdTrack-IRF8-CMV was linearized by Pme I , followed by 
homologous recombination with bone vector pAdEasy-1 in E.coli BJ5183. Recombinant
adenovirus vector pAd-IRF8 was obtained and linearized by Pac I , and then
transfected into AD293 cells. The recombinant adenovirus Ad-IRF8 was harvested
after packaged in AD293 cells. RAW264.7 cells were infected by Ad-IRF8. The
overexpression of IRF8 was verified with semi-quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The influence of the
overexpression of IRF8 on sRANKL-induced differentiation of RAW264.7 cells was
detected by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
RESULTS: The shuttle vector pAdTrack-IRF8-CMV and recombinant vector pAd-IRF8
were successfully constructed. The recombinant adenovirus Ad-IRF8 was also
successfully packaged in AD293 cells. The overexpression of IRF8 in RAW264.7
cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. TRAP staining showed that the
overexpression of IRF8 effectively inhibited the differentiation of RAW264.7
cells into osteoclast-like cells.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant adenovirus Ad-IRF8 was successfully constructed and
the overexpression of IRF8 was also detected in RAW264.7 cells. The overexpressed
IRF8 can effectively inhibit the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into
osteoclast-like cells.

To systematically investigate the impact of immune stimulation upon regulatory
variant activity, we exposed primary monocytes from 432 healthy Europeans to
interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN-<U+03B3>) or differing durations of lipopolysaccharide and mapped
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). More than half of cis-eQTLs
identified, involving hundreds of genes and associated pathways, are detected
specifically in stimulated monocytes. Induced innate immune activity reveals
multiple master regulatory trans-eQTLs including the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC), coding variants altering enzyme and receptor function, an IFN-ß
cytokine network showing temporal specificity, and an interferon regulatory
factor 2 (IRF2) transcription factor-modulated network. Induced eQTL are
significantly enriched for genome-wide association study loci, identifying
context-specific associations to putative causal genes including CARD9, ATM, and 
IRF8. Thus, applying pathophysiologically relevant immune stimuli assists
resolution of functional genetic variants.

Transcriptional and metabolic pre-B cell receptor-mediated checkpoints:
implications for autoimmune diseases.

At the pre-B cell stage of lymphocyte development, immunoglobulin light-chains
are not yet produced, and heavy-chains are covalently linked to surrogate
light-chains composed of VpreB and <U+03BB>5 to form the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR)
in a non-covalent association with signal-transducing modules. Even tough the
pre-BCR does not have the potential to bind conventional antigens, accumulating
evidence indicates that pre-BCR-mediated checkpoints are important both for
negative and positive selection of self-reactivity, and that defects in these
regulatory nodes may be associated with autoimmune disease. Thus, the
transcription factor BACH2, which represents a susceptibility locus for
rheumatoid arthritis, has recently emerged as a crucial mediator of negative
selection at a pre-BCR checkpoint. The lysosome-associated protein LAPTM5, which 
is highly expressed in an animal model of Sjögren's syndrome, plays a role in
down-modulation of the pre-BCR. Studies of copy number variation in rheumatoid
arthritis suggest that a reduced dosage of the VPREB1 gene is involved in disease
pathogenesis. Notably, animal models of autoimmune disease exhibit defects in
pre-B to naïve B cell checkpoints. Administration of a pre-BCR ligand, which also
plays a role in anergy both in human and murine B lymphocytes, ameliorates
disease in experimental models of autoimmunity. Further investigation is required
to gain a better insight into the molecular mechanisms of pre-BCR-mediated
checkpoints and to determine their relevance to autoimmune diseases.

We generated a mouse model with a 162 nt AU-rich element (ARE) region deletion in
the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) gene that
results in chronic circulating serum IFN-<U+03B3> levels. Mice homozygous for the ARE
deletion (ARE-Del) (-/-) present both serologic and cellular abnormalities
typical of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). ARE-Del(-/-) mice
display increased numbers of pDCs in bone marrow and spleen. Addition of IFN-<U+03B3> to
Flt3-ligand (Flt3L) treated in vitro bone marrow cultures results in a 2-fold
increase in pDCs with concurrent increases in IRF8 expression. Marginal zone B
(MZB) cells and marginal zone macrophages (MZMs) are absent in ARE-Del(-/-) mice.
ARE-Del(+/-) mice retain both MZB cells and MZMs and develop no or mild
autoimmunity. However, low dose clodronate treatment in ARE-Del(+/-) mice
specifically eliminates MZMs and promotes anti-DNA antibody development and
glomerulonephritis. Our findings demonstrate the consequences of a chronic IFN-<U+03B3> 
milieu on B220(+) cell types and in particular the impact of MZB cell loss on MZM
function in autoimmunity. Furthermore, similarities between disease states in
ARE-Del(-/-) mice and SLE patients suggest that IFN-<U+03B3> may not only be a product
of SLE but may be critical for disease onset and progression.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial superantigens are virulence factors that cause toxic shock 
syndrome. Here, the genome-wide, temporal response of mice to lethal intranasal
staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) challenge was investigated in six tissues.
RESULTS: The earliest responses and largest number of affected genes occurred in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), spleen, and lung tissues with the
highest content of both T-cells and monocyte/macrophages, the direct cellular
targets of SEB. In contrast, the response of liver, kidney, and heart was delayed
and involved fewer genes, but revealed a dominant genetic program that was seen
in all 6 tissues. Many of the 85 uniquely annotated transcripts participating in 
this shared genomic response have not been previously linked to SEB. Nine of the 
85 genes were subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR in every tissue/organ at 24 h.
These 85 transcripts, up-regulated in all tissues, annotated to the interferon
(IFN)/antiviral-response and included genes belonging to the DNA/RNA sensing
system, DNA damage repair, the immunoproteasome, and the ER/metabolic
stress-response and apoptosis pathways. Overall, this shared program was
identified as a type I and II interferon (IFN)-response and the promoters of
these genes were highly enriched for IFN regulatory matrices. Several genes whose
secreted products induce the IFN pathway were up-regulated at early time points
in PBMCs, spleen, and/or lung. Furthermore, IFN regulatory factors including
Irf1, Irf7 and Irf8, and Zbp1, a DNA sensor/transcription factor that can
directly elicit an IFN innate immune response, participated in this host-wide SEB
signature.
CONCLUSION: Global gene-expression changes across multiple organs implicated a
host-wide IFN-response in SEB-induced death. Therapies aimed at IFN-associated
innate immunity may improve outcome in toxic shock syndromes.

Interleukin (IL)-27 is known to be increased considerably in cord blood (CB)
dendritic cells (DCs) after TLR ligation. Previously, we demonstrated that also
basal IL-27 levels are higher in CB DCs. Here, we examined effects of IL-27 on
monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDCs) to approach its particular role in the
specialized immune system of the human neonate. Exogenous IL-27 promotes IL-27
transcription in CB and adult blood (AB) moDCs. IL-27 acts on CB moDCs primarily 
by significantly augmenting IL-27 protein, secondarily by increasing
transcription of CXCL10 among other chemokines, chemokine receptor CCR1,
interferon stimulated genes, transcription factor IRF8 and genes involved in
antigen presentation. Furthermore, CB moDCs respond to IL-27 with augmented IL-8 
and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. The results suggest that IL-27 enhances
migrational and antiviral properties of CB dendritic cells.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 protects against cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion
injury.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a transcriptional regulator in the IRF
family, has been implicated in innate immunity, immune cell differentiation and
tumour cell apoptosis. In the present study, we found that IRF8 is constitutively
expressed in the brain and suppressed after cerebral ischaemia in a
time-dependent manner. IRF8 knockout (IRF8-KO) mice, wild type (WT) mice,
neuron-specific IRF8 transgenic (TG) mice and non-transgenic mice were used in a 
transient cerebral ischaemic model. The IRF8 knockout mice exhibited aggravated
apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative injury in the ischaemic brain, eventually
leading to poorer stroke outcomes, whereas neuron-specific IRF8 transgenic mice
showed a marked inhibition of apoptosis and improved stroke outcomes. To model
ischaemia/reperfusion conditions in vitro, primary cortical neurons were cultured
and subjected to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation for 60 min. Similar to 
the in vivo study, IRF8 knockdown by Ad-shIRF8 resulted in increased apoptosis,
whereas IRF8 over-expression by Ad-IRF8 significantly decreased neuronal
apoptosis. These data indicate that IRF8 is strongly protective in ischaemic
stroke by regulating neuronal apoptosis, the inflammatory response and oxidative 
stress. In the present study, we found that the transcriptional factor IRF8 plays
a protective role in the cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion injury by attenuating
neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation. Besides the known function
of IRF8 in regulating the inflammatory gene expression, we first demonstrated
that IRF8 can directly modulate apoptosis and oxidative stress by controlling the
relative genes expression.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is known to affect the innate immune
response, for example, by regulating the differentiation and function of immune
cells. However, whether IRF8 can influence cardiac hypertrophy is unknown. Here
we show that IRF8 levels are decreased in human dilated/hypertrophic
cardiomyopathic hearts and in murine hypertrophic hearts. Mice overexpressing
Irf8 specifically in the heart are resistant to aortic banding (AB)-induced
cardiac hypertrophy, whereas mice lacking IRF8 either globally or specifically in
cardiomyocytes develop an aggravated phenotype induced by pressure overload.
Mechanistically, we show that IRF8 directly interacts with NFATc1 to prevent
NFATc1 translocation and thus inhibits the hypertrophic response. Inhibition of
NFATc1 ameliorates the cardiac abnormalities in IRF8(-/-) mice after AB. In
contrast, constitutive activation of NFATc1 nullifies the protective effects of
IRF8 on cardiac hypertrophy in IRF8-overexpressing mice. Our results indicate
that IRF8 is a potential therapeutic target in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

The transcription factors c-Myc and N-Myc--encoded by Myc and Mycn,
respectively--regulate cellular growth and are required for embryonic
development. A third paralogue, Mycl1, is dispensable for normal embryonic
development but its biological function has remained unclear. To examine the in
vivo function of Mycl1 in mice, we generated an inactivating Mycl1(gfp) allele
that also reports Mycl1 expression. We find that Mycl1 is selectively expressed
in dendritic cells (DCs) of the immune system and controlled by IRF8, and that
during DC development, Mycl1 expression is initiated in the common DC progenitor 
concurrent with reduction in c-Myc expression. Mature DCs lack expression of
c-Myc and N-Myc but maintain L-Myc expression even in the presence of
inflammatory signals such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
All DC subsets develop in Mycl1-deficient mice, but some subsets such as
migratory CD103(+) conventional DCs in the lung and liver are greatly reduced at 
steady state. Importantly, loss of L-Myc by DCs causes a significant decrease in 
in vivo T-cell priming during infection by Listeria monocytogenes and vesicular
stomatitis virus. The replacement of c-Myc by L-Myc in immature DCs may provide
for Myc transcriptional activity in the setting of inflammation that is required 
for optimal T-cell priming.

Recent epidemiological studies have identified interferon regulatory factor 8
(IRF8) as a susceptibility factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, how IRF8 
influences the neuroinflammatory disease has remained unknown. By studying the
role of IRF8 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of
MS, we found that Irf8(-/-) mice are resistant to EAE. Furthermore, expression of
IRF8 in antigen-presenting cells (APCs, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and
microglia), but not in T cells, facilitated disease onset and progression through
multiple pathways. IRF8 enhanced avß8 integrin expression in APCs and activated
TGF-ß signaling leading to T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation. IRF8 induced 
a cytokine milieu that favored growth and maintenance of Th1 and Th17 cells, by
stimulating interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 production, but inhibiting IL-27
during EAE. Finally, IRF8 activated microglia and exacerbated neuroinflammation. 
Together, this work provides mechanistic bases by which IRF8 contributes to the
pathogenesis of MS.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
in the western world. FL carries characteristic recurrent structural genomic
aberrations. However, information regarding the coding genome in FL is still
evolving. Here, we describe the results of massively parallel exome sequencing
and single nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array genomic profiling of 11 highly
purified FL cases, and 1 transformed FL case and the validation of selected
mutations in 102 FL cases. We report the identification of 15 novel recurrently
mutated genes in FL. These include frequent mutations in the linker histone genes
HIST1H1 B-E (27%) and mutations in OCT2 (also known as POU2F2; 8%), IRF8 (6%),
and ARID1A (11%). A subset of the mutations in HIST1H1 B-E affected binding to
DNMT3B, and mutations in HIST1H1 B-E and in EZH2 or ARID1A were largely mutually 
exclusive, implicating HIST1H1 B-E in epigenetic deregulation in FL. Mutations in
OCT2 (POU2F2) affected its transcriptional and functional properties as measured 
through luciferase assays, the biological analysis of stably transduced cell
lines, and global expression profiling. Finally, multiple novel mutated genes
located within regions of acquired uniparental disomy in FL are identified. In
aggregate, these data substantially broaden our understanding of the genomic
pathogenesis of FL.

Infant mortality from viral infection remains a major global health concern:
viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a
more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication.
Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes
acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in
infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8<U+207A> T cells fail to expand and control
infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-a
supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell 
responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We
postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as
one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in
vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying
pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated
downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an
adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the
E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as
MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-<U+03BA>B, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and 
during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU,
a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T
cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable
to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel
strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-a responses.

CD11b(+) dendritic cells (DCs) seem to be specialized for presenting antigens via
major histocompatibility (MHC) class II complexes to stimulate helper T cells,
but the genetic and regulatory basis for this is not established. Conditional
deletion of Irf4 resulted in loss of CD11b(+) DCs, impaired formation of
peptide-MHC class II complexes and defective priming of helper T cells but not of
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Gene expression and chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analyses delineated an
IRF4-dependent regulatory module that programs enhanced MHC class II antigen
presentation. Expression of the transcription factor IRF4 but not of IRF8
restored the ability of IRF4-deficient DCs to efficiently process and present
antigen to MHC class II-restricted T cells and promote helper T cell responses.
We propose that the evolutionary divergence of IRF4 and IRF8 facilitated the
specialization of DC subsets for distinct modes of antigen presentation and
priming of helper T cell versus CTL responses.

The 58-kda microspherule protein (MSP58) represses human telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT) gene expression and cell proliferation by interacting with 
telomerase transcriptional element-interacting factor (TEIF).

DY.

58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) plays an important role in a variety of
cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation and
oncogenic transformation. Currently, the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic
effect of MSP58 are not fully understood. The human telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT) gene, which encodes an essential component for telomerase
activity that is involved in cellular immortalization and transformation, is
strictly regulated at the gene transcription level. Our previous study revealed a
novel function of MSP58 in cellular senescence. Here we identify telomerase
transcriptional element-interacting factor (TEIF) as a novel MSP58-interacting
protein and determine the effect of MSP58 on hTERT transcription. This study thus
provides evidence showing MSP58 to be a negative regulator of hTERT expression
and telomerase activity. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that MSP58 could
suppress the transcription ofhTERTpromoter. Additionally, stable overexpression
of MSP58 protein in HT1080 and 293T cells decreased both endogenous hTERT
expression and telomerase activity. Conversely, their upregulation was induced by
MSP58 silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that MSP58 binds to 
the hTERT proximal promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of MSP58 inhibited
TEIF-mediated hTERT transactivation, telomerase activation, and cell
proliferation promotion. The inhibitory effect of MSP58 occurred through
inhibition of TEIF binding to DNA. Ultimately, the HT1080-implanted xenograft
mouse model confirmed these cellular effects. Together, our findings provide new 
insights into both the biological function of MSP58 and the regulation of
telomerase/hTERT expression.

Since 1996, several studies characterizing the association between primary
immunodeficiencies and susceptibility to infections with environmental and
non-pathogenic mycobacteria such as the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Mycobacterium
bovis Bacillus of Calmette Guérin strain) as well as disseminated infections by
Salmonella spp. have been conducted. These conditions, grouped in the so-called
Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, include a primary
immunodeficiency caused by mutations in 7 autosomal genes (IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL12B,
IL12BR1, STAT1, ISG15, and IRF8) and an X-linked gene (NEMO). This syndrome
presents a high degree of allelic heterogeneity and variable penetrance. This
review focuses on the analysis of the first reported cases of these diseases, as 
well as on the molecular findings involved in each of them.

Langerhans cells (LCs) are the unique dendritic cells found in the epidermis.
While a great deal of attention has focused on defining the developmental origins
of LCs, reports addressing the transcriptional network ruling their
differentiation remain sparse. We addressed the function of a group of key DC
transcription factors-PU.1, ID2, IRF4, and IRF8-in the establishment of the LC
network. We show that although steady-state LC homeostasis depends on PU.1 and
ID2, the latter is dispensable for bone marrow-derived LCs. PU.1 controls LC
differentiation by regulating the expression of the critical TGF-ß responsive
transcription factor RUNX3. PU.1 directly binds to the Runx3 regulatory elements 
in a TGF-ß-dependent manner, whereas ectopic expression of RUNX3 rescued LC
differentiation in the absence of PU.1 and promoted LC differentiation from
PU.1-sufficient progenitors. These findings highlight the dual molecular network 
underlying LC differentiation, and show the central role of PU.1 in these
processes.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a member of the IRF transcription factor
family, was recently implicated in vascular diseases. In the present study, using
the mouse left carotid artery wire injury model, we unexpectedly observed that
the expression of IRF8 was greatly enhanced in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) by
injury. Compared with the wild-type controls, IRF8 global knockout mice exhibited
reduced neointimal lesions and maintained SMC marker gene expression. We further 
generated SMC-specific IRF8 transgenic mice using an SM22a-driven IRF8 plasmid
construct. In contrast to the knockout mice, mice with SMC-overexpressing IRF8
exhibited a synthetic phenotype and enhanced neointima formation.
Mechanistically, IRF8 inhibited SMC marker gene expression through regulating
serum response factor (SRF) transactivation in a myocardin-dependent manner.
Furthermore, a coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated a direct interaction of IRF8
with myocardin, in which a specific region of myocardin was essential for
recruiting acetyltransferase p300. Altogether, IRF8 is crucial in modulating SMC 
phenotype switching and neointima formation in response to vascular injury via
direct interaction with the SRF/myocardin complex.

BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have dramatically improved therapy for
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, several problems leading to TKI
resistance still impede a complete cure of this disease. IFN regulatory factor-8 
(IRF8) is a transcription factor essential for the development and functions of
immune cells, including dendritic cells. Irf8(-/-) mice develop a CML-like
disease and IRF8 expression is downregulated in patients with CML, suggesting
that IRF8 is involved in the pathogenesis of CML. In this study, by using a
murine CML model, we show that BCR-ABL strongly inhibits a generation of
dendritic cells from an early stage of their differentiation in vivo, concomitant
with suppression of Irf8 expression. Forced expression of IRF8 overrode BCR-ABL
(both wild-type and T315I-mutated) to rescue dendritic cell development in vitro,
indicating that the suppression of Irf8 causes dendritic cell deficiency. Gene
expression profiling revealed that IRF8 restored the expression of a significant 
portion of BCR-ABL-dysregulated genes and predicted that BCR-ABL has
immune-stimulatory potential. Indeed, IRF8-rescued BCR-ABL-expressing dendritic
cells were capable of inducing CTLs more efficiently than control dendritic
cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that IRF8 is an attractive target in
next-generation therapies for CML.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are heterogeneous cell populations represented by different
subtypes, each varying in terms of gene expression patterns and specific
functions. Recent studies identified transcription factors essential for the
development of different DC subtypes, yet molecular mechanisms for the
developmental program and functions remain poorly understood. In this study, we
developed and characterized a mouse DC progenitor-like cell line, designated DC9,
from Irf8(-/-) bone marrow cells as a model for DC development and function.
Expression of Irf8 in DC9 cells led to plasmacytoid DCs and CD8a(+) DC-like
cells, with a concomitant increase in plasmacytoid DC- and CD8a(+) DC-specific
gene transcripts and induction of type I IFNs and IL12p40 following TLR ligand
stimulation. Irf8 expression in DC9 cells led to an increase in Id2 and Batf3
transcript levels, transcription factors shown to be important for the
development of CD8a(+) DCs. We show that, without Irf8, expression of Id2 and
Batf3 was not sufficient for directing classical CD8a(+) DC development. When
coexpressed with Irf8, Batf3 and Id2 had a synergistic effect on classical
CD8a(+) DC development. We demonstrate that Irf8 is upstream of Batf3 and Id2 in 
the classical CD8a(+) DC developmental program and define the hierarchical
relationship of transcription factors important for classical CD8a(+) DC
development.

A role for IRF8 in B cell anergy.

Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198.

B cell central tolerance is a process through which self-reactive B cells are
removed from the B cell repertoire. Self-reactive B cells are generally removed
by receptor editing in the bone marrow and by anergy induction in the periphery. 
IRF8 is a critical transcriptional regulator of immune system development and
function. A recent study showed that marginal zone B cell and B1 B cell
populations are dramatically increased in IRF8-deficient mice, indicating that
there are B cell-developmental defects in the absence of IRF8. In this article,
we report that mice deficient for IRF8 produced anti-dsDNA Abs. Using a hen egg
lysozyme double-transgenic model, we further demonstrate that B cell anergy was
breached in IRF8-deficient mice. Although anergic B cells in the IRF8-proficient 
background were blocked at the transitional stage of development, anergic B cells
in the IRF8-deficient background were able to mature further, which allowed them 
to regain responses to Ag stimulation. Interestingly, our results show that
IRF8-deficient B cells were more sensitive to Ag stimulation and were resistant
to Ag-induced cell death. Moreover, our results show that IRF8 was expressed at a
high level in the anergic B cells, and an elevated level of IRF8 promoted
apoptosis in the transitional B cells. Thus, our findings reveal a previously
unrecognized function of IRF8 in B cell anergy induction.

P2X4 receptors and neuropathic pain.

Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University Fukuoka, Japan.

Neuropathic pain, a debilitating pain condition, is a common consequence of
damage to the nervous system. Neuropathic pain is often resistant to currently
available analgesics. A growing body of evidence indicates that spinal microglia 
react and undergo a series of changes that directly influence the establishment
of neuropathic pain states. After nerve injury, P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) are
upregulated in spinal microglia by several factors at the transcriptional and
translational levels. Those include the CC chemokine CCL21 derived from damaged
neurons, the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin in the spinal cord, and the
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) expressed in
microglia. P2X4R expression in microglia is also regulated at the
post-translational level by signaling from other cell-surface receptors such as
CC chemokine receptor (CCR2). Importantly, inhibiting the function or expression 
of P2X4Rs and P2X4R-regulating molecules suppresses the aberrant excitability of 
dorsal horn neurons and neuropathic pain. These findings indicate that
P2X4R-positive microglia are a central player in mechanisms for neuropathic pain.
Thus, microglial P2X4Rs are a potential target for treating the chronic pain
state.

Loss of DAP12 and FcR<U+03B3> drives exaggerated IL-12 production and CD8(+) T cell
response by CCR2(+) Mo-DCs.

Dap12 and FcR<U+03B3>, the two transmembrane ITAM-containing signaling adaptors
expressed in dendritic cells (DC), are implicated in the regulation of DC
function. Several activating and adhesion receptors including integrins require
these chains for their function in triggering downstream signaling and effector
pathways, however the exact role(s) for Dap12 and FcR<U+03B3> remains elusive as their
loss can lead to both attenuating and enhancing effects. Here, we report that
mice congenitally lacking both Dap12 and FcR<U+03B3> chains (DF) show a massively
enhanced effector CD8(+) T cell response to protein antigen immunization or West 
Nile Virus (WNV) infection. Thus, immunization of DF mice with MHCI-restricted
OVA peptide leads to accumulation of IL-12-producing monocyte-derived dendritic
cells (Mo-DC) in draining lymph nodes, followed by vastly enhanced generation of 
antigen-specific IFN<U+03B3>-producing CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, DF mice show increased 
viral clearance in the WNV infection model. Depletion of CCR2+
monocytes/macrophages in vivo by administration anti-CCR2 antibodies or
clodronate liposomes completely prevents the exaggerated CD8+ T cell response in 
DF mice. Mechanistically, we show that the loss of Dap12 and FcR<U+03B3>-mediated
signals in Mo-DC leads to a disruption of GM-CSF receptor-induced STAT5
activation resulting in upregulation of expression of IRF8, a transcription
factor. Consequently, Dap12- and FcR<U+03B3>-deficiency exacerbates GM-CSF-driven
monocyte differentiation and production of inflammatory Mo-DC. Our data suggest a
novel cross-talk between DC-ITAM and GM-CSF signaling pathways, which controls
Mo-DC differentiation, IL-12 production, and CD8(+) T cell responses.

OBJECTIVE: The anatomic location of subsequent relapses in early multiple
sclerosis (MS) appears to be predicted by the first attack location. We sought to
determine if genetic polymorphisms associated with MS susceptibility are
associated with attack location.
METHODS: 17 genome-wide association study-identified MS susceptibility
polymorphisms were genotyped in 503 white, non-Hispanic patients seen within a
year of MS onset. Their association with the CNS location of the first two MS
attacks was assessed in multivariate repeated measures analyses (generalized
estimating equations with robust standard errors).
RESULTS: The IL12A polymorphism was independently associated with increased odds 
of attacks involving the spinal cord (OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.52, 95% CI 1.11, 2.07, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.009),
as was the IRF8 polymorphism (OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.40, 95% CI [1.04, 5.50], p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.040). The
IL7R polymorphism was associated with reduced odds of attacks involving the
brainstem/cerebellum (OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.97, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.041), as were the
TNFRSF1A and IL12A polymorphisms. The CD6 polymorphism conferred reduced odds of 
optic neuritis as an attack location (OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.69, 95% CI [0.49, 0.97], p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.034).
Several other genes showed trends for association with attack location.
CONCLUSIONS: Some of the MS susceptibility genes may be associated with MS attack
location. The IL12A polymorphism is of particular interest given that interferon 
beta therapy appears to influence IL12 levels. These findings may lead to
improved understanding of MS pathogenesis and treatment.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in children with inborn errors of the
immune system.

Severe mycobacterial disease is mostly confined to patients who are
immunocompromized either by acquired or inherited causes. One such genetic
disorder is Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD), a hot topic
within the field of primary immunodeficiency. This single gene disorder is
characterized by isolated infection with mycobacteria or Salmonella due to a
defect in the type-1 cytokine response. In the last two decades, ten genes have
been labeled as causing MSMD when they harbor germline mutations, namely IL12B,
IL12RB1, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1, IKBKG, CYBB, TYK2, IRF8 and ISG15. The mutations 
lead to either insufficient production of IFN-<U+03B3>, or to an insufficient response
to the cytokine. Current treatment options include recombinant IFN-<U+03B3> and
hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the future, gene therapy,
antisense-mediated exon skipping and chemical intervention in glycosylation
problems may become successful alternatives. Furthermore, it is likely that many 
new candidate genes and pathways crucial for mycobacterial immunity will be
identified.

Cross talk between Wnt/ß-catenin and Irf8 in leukemia progression and drug
resistance.

Progression and disease relapse of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) depends on
leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) that resist treatment. Using mouse genetics and a
BCR-ABL model of CML, we observed cross talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and 
the interferon-regulatory factor 8 (Irf8). In normal hematopoiesis, activation of
ß-catenin results in up-regulation of Irf8, which in turn limits oncogenic
ß-catenin functions. Self-renewal and myeloproliferation become dependent on
ß-catenin in Irf8-deficient animals that develop a CML-like disease. Combined
Irf8 deletion and constitutive ß-catenin activation result in progression of CML 
into fatal blast crisis, elevated leukemic potential of BCR-ABL-induced LICs, and
Imatinib resistance. Interestingly, activated ß-catenin enhances a preexisting
Irf8-deficient gene signature, identifying ß-catenin as an amplifier of
progression-specific gene regulation in the shift of CML to blast crisis.
Collectively, our data uncover Irf8 as a roadblock for ß-catenin-driven leukemia 
and imply both factors as targets in combinatorial therapy.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cell development is regulated by a STAT/IRF-8 axis.

Waight JD, Netherby C, Hensen ML, Miller A, Hu Q, Liu S, Bogner PN, Farren MR,
Lee KP, Liu K, Abrams SI.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) comprise immature myeloid populations
produced in diverse pathologies, including neoplasia. Because MDSCs can impair
antitumor immunity, these cells have emerged as a significant barrier to cancer
therapy. Although much research has focused on how MDSCs promote tumor
progression, it remains unclear how MDSCs develop and why the MDSC response is
heavily granulocytic. Given that MDSCs are a manifestation of aberrant
myelopoiesis, we hypothesized that MDSCs arise from perturbations in the
regulation of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8), an integral transcriptional
component of myeloid differentiation and lineage commitment. Overall, we
demonstrated that (a) Irf8-deficient mice generated myeloid populations highly
homologous to tumor-induced MDSCs with respect to phenotype, function, and gene
expression profiles; (b) IRF-8 overexpression in mice attenuated MDSC
accumulation and enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy; (c) the MDSC-inducing
factors G-CSF and GM-CSF facilitated IRF-8 downregulation via STAT3- and
STAT5-dependent pathways; and (d) IRF-8 levels in MDSCs of breast cancer patients
declined with increasing MDSC frequency, implicating IRF-8 as a negative
regulator in human MDSC biology. Together, our results reveal a previously
unrecognized role for IRF-8 expression in MDSC subset development, which may
provide new avenues to target MDSCs in neoplasia.

TLRs play a central role in the innate recognition of pathogens and the
activation of dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we establish that, in
addition to TLR11, TLR12 recognizes the profilin protein of the protozoan
parasite Toxoplasma gondii and regulates IL-12 production by DCs in response to
the parasite. Similar to TLR11, TLR12 is an endolysosomal innate immune receptor 
that colocalizes and interacts with UNC93B1. Biochemical experiments revealed
that TLR11 and TLR12 directly bind to T. gondii profilin and are capable of
forming a heterodimer complex. We also establish that the transcription factor
IFN regulatory factor 8, not NF-<U+03BA>B, plays a central role in the regulation of the
TLR11- and TLR12-dependent IL-12 response of DCs. These results suggest a central
role for IFN regulatory factor 8-expressing CD8(+) DCs in governing the TLR11-
and TLR12-mediated host defense against T. gondii.

Dendritic cells (DCs) drive both adaptive and innate immunity. Recent findings
support the notion that distinct subsets of classical DCs favor alternative
modules of immunity, acting on innate lymphoid-like cells (ILCs) and T cells
similarly to promote either ILC1/Th1/CTL- or ILC3/Th17-type responses.
Coordination between DC subsets and their favored immune module might imply that 
the genetic programs for DC diversification preceded the emergence of
recombination-activating gene-dependent adaptive immunity and operate initially
in coordinating ILC repertoires for appropriate responses against pathogens.
Consequently, understanding the molecular basis of DC developmental and
diversification is important for an underlying appreciation of immune regulation.
Currently, the basis for DC development into the recognized subsets/lineages is
only partially understood, based on the requirements for several transcription
factors including PU.1, Bcl11a, Irf8, E2-2, Id2, Irf4, Irf8, Batf3, and other
BATF family members. This chapter will briefly review recent transcriptional
aspects of DC development and function and then highlight some currently
unresolved questions.

Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma, SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by
vasculopathy, inflammation, and fibrosis that can lead to loss of organ function.
Type I interferons (IFNs) are family of cytokines that mitigate the deleterious
effects of viral and bacterial infections in the innate immunity system. Past
several years, research efforts have been focused on the role of type I IFN and
IFN-inducible genes in the pathogenesis of SSc. Polymorphisms in the Interferon
regulatory factor (IRF)-5, IRF7, and IRF8 are associated with SSc, Similarly,
polymorphism of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-4, has
been established as a genetic risk factor of SSc. IRFs and STAT4 proteins are key
activators of type I IFN signaling pathways. An IFN signature (increased
expression and activation of IFN-regulated genes) has been observed in the
peripheral blood and skin biopsy samples of patients with SSc. Furthermore, a
plasma IFN-inducible chemokine score correlated with markers of disease severity 
and autoantibody subtypes in SSc. In this review, we summarize our current
knowledge of the role of type I IFNs and IFN-inducible genes in the pathogenesis 
of SSc and their potential role as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IRF8 gene are associated with systemic lupus

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) has been shown to have diverse roles in the
regulation of the immune system. Two recent studies had revealed the association 
between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs11644034 and rs2280381) of
IRF8 and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a multiethnic population. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the association could be replicated
in a Chinese Han population. Genotypes were determined by a multiplex polymerase 
chain reaction-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR) in 358 patients and 357
geographically matched healthy controls. Significant differences in genotype
frequency were found between SLE and control individuals (rs11644034: AA vs. GG, 
P = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 0.980, 95% confidence internal (CI): 0.964-0.996;
rs2280381: CC vs. TT, P = 0.005, OR = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.033-0.676). Conditional
logistic regression analysis showed that the association of rs2280381 remained
significant (P adjusted = 0.028) after adjustment for rs11644034, but not vice
versa (P adjusted = 0.361).When stratifying patients with SLE according to
clinical subtypes, SNP rs2280381 was found to be associated with low complement
in patients with SLE. However, SNP rs11644034 was not found to be associated with
SLE clinical subgroups. Analysis of the haplotypes revealed that haplotype G-T
and G-C were also significantly associated with SLE (P = 0.002 and P = 0.012,
respectively). Our study indicated that the IRF8 gene polymorphisms might be
associated with susceptibility to SLE and with disease-related clinical
manifestations in Chinese Han population.

Expression of the immune regulator tripartite-motif 21 is controlled by IFN
regulatory factors.

Tripartite-motif 21 (TRIM21) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates innate
immune responses by ubiquitinating IFN regulatory factors (IRFs). TRIM21 is
mainly found in hematopoietic cells in which its expression is induced by IFNs
during viral. infections and in systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. However, the exact molecular
mechanism by which the expression of the Trim21 gene is regulated is unknown. In 
this study, we demonstrate that IFNs induce Trim21 expression in immune cells via
IRFs and that IFN-a and IFN-ß are the most potent inducers of Trim21. A
functional IFN-stimulated response element but no conserved IFN-<U+03B3>-activated site 
was detected in the promoter of Trim21. IRF1 and IRF2 strongly induced Trim21
expression in an IFN-stimulated response element-dependent manner, whereas IRF4
and IRF8 strongly repressed the IRF1-mediated induction of Trim21. Consistent
with this observation, baseline expression of Trim21 was elevated in Irf4(-/-)
cells. TRIM21, IRF1, and IRF2 expression was increased in PBMCs from patients
with Sjögren's syndrome compared with healthy controls. In contrast, IRF4 and
IRF8 expression was not increased in PBMCs from patients. The IFN-<U+03B3>-mediated
induction of Trim21 was completely abolished by inhibiting protein synthesis with
cycloheximide, and Trim21 expression could not be induced by IFN-<U+03B3> in Irf1(-/-)
cells, demonstrating that IFN-<U+03B3> induces Trim21 indirectly via IRF1 and not
directly via STAT1 activation. Our data demonstrate that multiple IRFs tightly
regulate expression of Trim21 in immune cells, suggesting that a well-controlled 
expression of the E3 ligase TRIM21 is important for regulation of immune
responses.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor that plays a
critical role in normal hematopoiesis, such that disruption of IRF8 activity
promotes leukemogenesis. We and others have identified aberrant expression of
IRF8 transcripts, including novel splice variants, in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), but studies have not investigated the prognostic significance of these
transcripts. Therefore, we developed and optimized quantitative expression assays
for both, the wild type, or the reference sequence (WT-IRF8) and novel splice
variants (SV-IRF8). These assays were used to quantify IRF8 transcript levels in 
194 adult patients with AML, and multivariate analyses investigated the
prognostic significance of these expression levels. After adjusting for known
prognostic factors, expression levels of WT- or SV-IRF8 transcripts were not
significantly associated with complete responses or overall survival. However,
increased expression of WT-IRF8 was associated with decreased relapse-free
survival (RFS) in both univariate (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.010) and multivariate (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.019)
analyses. Similarly, increased expression of SV-IRF8 was associated with a
decreased RFS (univariate, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.026 and multivariate, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.021). These studies 
show for the first time that WT-IRF8 and SV-IRF8 are independent adverse
prognostic factors for patients with AML. Additional studies are planned to
examine the prognostic significance of IRF8 transcripts in other populations of
AML patients.

Alleles of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) are associated with
susceptibility to both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis 
(MS). Although high-type I IFN is thought to be causal in SLE, type I IFN is used
as a therapy in MS. We investigated whether IRF8 alleles were associated with
type I IFN levels or serologic profiles in SLE and MS. Alleles that have been
previously associated with SLE or MS were genotyped in SLE and MS patients. The
MS-associated rs17445836G allele was associated with anti-double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) autoantibodies in SLE patients (meta-analysis odds ratio=1.92). The same 
allele was associated with decreased serum IFN activity in SLE patients with
anti-dsDNA antibodies, and with decreased type I IFN-induced gene expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cell from anti-dsDNA-negative SLE patients. In
secondary progressive MS patients, rs17445836G was associated with decreased
serum type I IFN. Rs17445836G was associated with increased IRF8 expression in
SLE patient B cells. In summary, IRF8 rs17445836G is associated with human
autoimmune disease characterized by low-type I IFN levels, and this may have
pharmacogenetic relevance as type I IFN is modulated in SLE and MS. The
association with autoantibodies and increased IRF8 expression in B cells supports
a role for rs17445836G in humoral tolerance.

Jaw bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors internalize more bisphosphonate
than long-bone marrow precursors.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are widely used in the treatment of several bone diseases, 
such as osteoporosis and cancers that have metastasized to bone, by virtue of
their ability to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption. Previously, it was shown
that osteoclasts present at different bone sites have different characteristics. 
We hypothesized that BPs could have distinct effects on different populations of 
osteoclasts and their precursors, for example as a result of a different capacity
to endocytose the drugs. To investigate this, bone marrow cells were isolated
from jaw and long bone from mice and the cells were primed to differentiate into 
osteoclasts with the cytokines M-CSF and RANKL. Before fusion occurred, cells
were incubated with fluorescein-risedronate (FAM-RIS) for 4 or 24h and uptake was
determined by flow cytometry. We found that cultures obtained from the jaw
internalized 1.7 to 2.5 times more FAM-RIS than long-bone cultures, both after 4 
and 24h, and accordingly jaw osteoclasts were more susceptible to inhibition of
prenylation of Rap1a after treatment with BPs for 24h. Surprisingly, differences 
in BP uptake did not differentially affect osteoclastogenesis. This suggests that
jaw osteoclast precursors are less sensitive to bisphosphonates after
internalization. This was supported by the finding that gene expression of the
anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was higher in jaw cells than long bone
cells, suggesting that the jaw cells might be more resistant to BP-induced
apoptosis. Our findings suggest that bisphosphonates have distinct effects on
both populations of osteoclast precursors and support previous findings that
osteoclasts and precursors are bone-site specific. This study may help to provide
more insights into bone-site-specific responses to bisphosphonates.

Increased Fanconi C expression contributes to the emergency granulopoiesis
response.

Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.

Emergency granulopoiesis is a component of the innate immune response that is
induced in response to infectious or inflammatory challenge. It is characterized 
by the rapid expansion and differentiation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitor
(GMP) populations, which is due in part to a shortened S-phase of the cell cycle.
We found that IRF8 (also known as ICSBP), an interferon regulatory transcription 
factor that activates phagocyte effector genes during the innate immune response,
activates the gene encoding Fanconi C (Fancc) in murine myeloid progenitor cells.
Moreover, IRF8-induced Fancc transcription was augmented by treatment with IL-1ß,
an essential cytokine for emergency granulopoiesis. The Fanconi pathway
participates in repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks during DNA
replication, leading us to hypothesize that the Fanconi pathway contributes to
genomic stability during emergency granulopoiesis. In support of this hypothesis,
Fancc(-/-) mice developed anemia and neutropenia during repeated, failed episodes
of emergency granulopoiesis. Failed emergency granulopoiesis in Fancc(-/-) mice
was associated with excess apoptosis of HSCs and progenitor cells in the bone
marrow and impaired HSC function. These studies have implications for
understanding the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia and
suggest possible therapeutic approaches.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) is required for development, maturation and
expression of anti-microbial defenses of myeloid cells. BXH2 mice harbor a
severely hypomorphic allele at Irf8 (Irf8(R294C)) that causes susceptibility to
infection with intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We
report that BXH2 are completely resistant to the development of cerebral malaria 
(ECM) following Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection. Comparative transcriptional
profiling of brain RNA as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and
high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify IRF8-regulated genes
whose expression is associated with pathological acute neuroinflammation. Genes
increased by infection were strongly enriched for IRF8 binding sites, suggesting 
that IRF8 acts as a transcriptional activator in inflammatory programs. These
lists were enriched for myeloid-specific pathways, including interferon
responses, antigen presentation and Th1 polarizing cytokines. We show that
inactivation of several of these downstream target genes (including the Irf8
transcription partner Irf1) confers protection against ECM. ECM-resistance in
Irf8 and Irf1 mutants is associated with impaired myeloid and lymphoid cells
function, including production of IL12p40 and IFN<U+03B3>. We note strong overlap
between genes bound and regulated by IRF8 during ECM and genes regulated in the
lungs of M. tuberculosis infected mice. This IRF8-dependent network contains
several genes recently identified as risk factors in acute and chronic human
inflammatory conditions. We report a common core of IRF8-bound genes forming a
critical inflammatory host-response network.

    Eur J Immunol. 2013 Jul;43(7):1896-906.

Interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors with
versatile functions in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In
the current issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Steinhagen et al. [Eur. 
J. Immunol. 2013. 43: 1896-1906] investigate the regulation of IFN-ß and IL-6
induction in human plasmacytoid DCs stimulated with CpG DNA. Using RNA
interference studies, the authors identify critical roles for IRF5 and IRF8 as
positive and negative regulators, respectively. In contrast, knockdown of IRF7
had no significant effect on IFN-ß or IL-6 gene induction. In this Commentary,
these findings are discussed in the context of the published literature and
recent data regarding IRF5 and IRF8 as susceptibility genes for autoimmunity.

Induction of innate immunity is essential for host survival of infection. Evasion
and inhibition of innate immunity constitute a strategy used by pathogens, such
as the highly virulent bacterium Francisella tularensis, to ensure their
replication and transmission. The mechanism and bacterial components responsible 
for this suppression of innate immunity by F. tularensis are not defined. In this
article, we demonstrate that lipids enriched from virulent F. tularensis strain
SchuS4, but not attenuated live vaccine strain, inhibit inflammatory responses in
vitro and in vivo. Suppression of inflammatory responses is associated with
I<U+03BA>Ba-independent inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>Bp65 activation and selective inhibition of
activation of IFN regulatory factors. Interference with NF-<U+03BA>Bp65 and IFN
regulatory factors is also observed following infection with viable SchuS4.
Together these data provide novel insight into how highly virulent bacteria
selectively modulate the host to interfere with innate immune responses required 
for survival of infection.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) plays a role in both innate and adaptive
systems in mammals. In this study, the gene and promoter sequences of Japanese
flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, (Po) IRF8 were cloned, and its expression in
response to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and lymphocystis disease
virus (LCDV) challenges was studied in vivo. The PoIRF8 gene spans over 3.3 kb
with a structure of 9 exon-8 intron and encodes 420 amino acids. The putative
protein shows the highest sequence identity (69.5-89.0%) to fish IRF8 and
possesses a DNA-binding domain (DBD), an IRF-association domain (IAD) and a
nuclear localization signal (NLS) of vertebrate IRF8. Phylogenetic analysis
classified PoIRF8 into the cluster of fish IRF8 within vertebrate IRF8 group of
IRF4 subfamily. A number of transcription factor binding sites were identified in
the 2348-bp 5' flanking region of PoIRF8 gene, including those of transcription
factors for type <U+2160> and type <U+2161> interferon (IFN) inducible genes and genes
regulating the development and function of lymphomyeloid cells in mammals. The
PoIRF8 transcripts were expressed in all examined tissues of healthy flounders,
with higher levels observed in the immune relevant tissues. They were
up-regulated by both poly I:C and LCDV treatments in the spleen, head kidney,
gills and muscle in an early phase of immune responses, with initiation and peak 
time points of induction prior to type <U+2160> IFN and Mx. Relative to LCDV, the
induction by poly I:C was quicker in all four tissues. These results indicate an 
involvement of PoIRF8 in the host's antiviral responses and a functional
conservation of IRF8 between fish and mammals.

The characterization of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) translocations provides 
information on the diagnosis and guides therapeutic decisions in mature B-cell
malignancies while enhancing our understanding of normal and malignant B-cell
biology. However, existing methodologies for the detection of IGH translocations 
are labor intensive, often require viable cells, and are biased toward known IGH 
fusions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a capture sequencing
strategy for the identification of IGH rearrangements at nucleotide level
resolution and tested its capabilities as a diagnostic and discovery tool in 78
primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). We readily identified IGH-BCL2, 
IGH-BCL6, IGH-MYC, and IGH-CCND1 fusions and discovered IRF8, EBF1, and TNFSF13
(APRIL) as novel IGH partners in these tumors. IRF8 and TNFSF13 expression was
significantly higher in lymphomas with IGH rearrangements targeting these loci.
Modeling the deregulation of IRF8 and EBF1 in vitro defined a lymphomagenic
profile characterized by up-regulation of AID and/or BCL6, down-regulation of
PRMD1, and resistance to apoptosis. Using a capture sequencing strategy, we
discovered the B-cell relevant genes IRF8, EBF1, and TNFSF13 as novel targets for
IGH deregulation. This methodology is poised to change how IGH translocations are
identified in clinical settings while remaining a powerful tool to uncover the
pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies.

macrophages and their progenitors.

The development of macrophages is a highly regulated process requiring
coordination amongst transcription factors. The presence/absence, relative
levels, antagonism, or synergy of all transcription factors involved is critical 
to directing lineage cell fate and differentiation. While relative levels of many
key myeloid transcription factors have been determined in mammalian macrophage
differentiation, a similar set of studies have yet to be conducted in a teleost
system. In this study, we report on the mRNA levels of transcription factors
(cebpa, cjun, cmyb, egr1, gata1, gata2, gata3, lmo2, mafb, pax5, pu.1 and runx1) 
in sorted goldfish progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages from primary
kidney macrophage cultures. The mRNA levels of runx1 and pu.1 were significantly 
higher, gata3 and pax5 mRNA levels were lower, in monocytes compared to
progenitors, and the mRNA levels of cjun, egr1, gata2, gata3, mafb and pax5 were 
significantly decreased in macrophages compared to progenitor cells. The relative
mRNA levels of the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors, 
irf1, irf2, irf5, irf7, irf8 and irf9 in sorted progenitors, monocytes and
macrophages were also measured. In contrast to other irf family transcription
factors examined, irf8 mRNA levels were increased in monocytes compared to
progenitors by greater than three-fold, suggesting that irf8 is important for
monopoiesis. Lastly, we show the differential regulation of myeloid transcription
factor mRNA levels in sorted progenitor cells from 1, 2, or 3-day old cultures in
response to the recombinant goldfish growth factors, rgCSF-1 and rgKITLA.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are heterogeneous immature myeloid cells
that accumulate in response to tumor progression. Compelling data from mouse
models and human cancer patients showed that tumor-induced inflammatory mediators
induce MDSC differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying MDSC persistence 
is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that tumor-induced MDSCs exhibit
significantly decreased spontaneous apoptosis as compared with myeloid cells with
the same phenotypes from tumor-free mice. Consistent with the decreased
apoptosis, cell surface Fas receptor decreased significantly in tumor-induced
MDSCs. Screening for changes of key apoptosis mediators downstream the Fas
receptor revealed that expression levels of IRF8 and Bax are diminished, whereas 
expression of Bcl-xL is increased in tumor-induced MDSCs. We further determined
that IRF8 binds directly to Bax and Bcl-x promoter in primary myeloid cells in
vivo, and IRF8-deficient MDSC-like cells also exhibit increased Bcl-xL and
decreased Bax expression. Analysis of CD69 and CD25 levels revealed that
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are partially activated in tumor-bearing hosts.
Strikingly, FasL but not perforin and granzymes were selectively activated in
CTLs in the tumor-bearing host. ABT-737 significantly increased the sensitivity
of MDSCs to Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro. More importantly, ABT-737 therapy
increased MDSC spontaneous apoptosis and decreased MDSC accumulation in
tumor-bearing mice. Our data thus determined that MDSCs use down-regulation of
IRF8 to alter Bax and Bcl-xL expression to deregulate the Fas-mediated apoptosis 
pathway to evade elimination by host CTLs. Therefore, targeting Bcl-xL is
potentially effective in suppression of MDSC persistence in cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have increased morbidity
and mortality in coronary heart disease (CHD). We asked whether there was a
genetic influence on CHD in systemic lupus erythematosus.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and CHD in 2 populations of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus was
assessed. Patients were genotyped on a custom 12k Illumina Array. The allele
frequencies were compared between patients with (n=66) and without (n=509) CHD.
We found 61 SNPs with an association (P<0.01) to CHD, with the strongest
association for 3 SNPs located in the interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) gene.
Comparison of the allele frequencies of these 61 SNPs in patients with (n=27) and
without (n=212) CHD in the second study population revealed that 2 SNPs, rs925994
and rs10514610 in IRF8 (linkage disequilibrium, r²=0.84), were associated with
CHD in both study populations. Meta-analysis of the SNP rs925994 gave an odds
ratio of 3.6 (2.1-6.3), P value 1.9×10<U+207B>6. The identified IRF8 allele remained as 
a risk factor for CHD after adjustment for traditional CHD risk factors. The IRF8
risk allele was associated with the presence of carotid plaques (P<0.001) and
increased intima-media thickness (P=0.01). By electrophoretic mobility shift
assays, we show weaker binding of protein to the risk allele of the highly linked
SNP rs11117415, and by flow cytometry, a reduced frequency of circulating B cells
was detected in patients with the IRF8 risk allele.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable genetic component for CHD in systemic lupus 
erythematosus, with IRF8 as a strong susceptibility locus.

The EBV Latent Antigen 3C Inhibits Apoptosis through Targeted Regulation of
Interferon Regulatory Factors 4 and 8.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to a broad spectrum of B-cell malignancies.
EBV nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is an encoded latent antigen required for growth 
transformation of primary human B-lymphocytes. Interferon regulatory factor 4
(IRF4) and 8 (IRF8) are transcription factors of the IRF family that regulate
diverse functions in B cell development. IRF4 is an oncoprotein with
anti-apoptotic properties and IRF8 functions as a regulator of apoptosis and
tumor suppressor in many hematopoietic malignancies. We now demonstrate that
EBNA3C can contribute to B-cell transformation by modulating the molecular
interplay between cellular IRF4 and IRF8. We show that EBNA3C physically
interacts with IRF4 and IRF8 with its N-terminal domain in vitro and forms a
molecular complex in cells. We identified the Spi-1/B motif of IRF4 as critical
for EBNA3C interaction. We also demonstrated that EBNA3C can stabilize IRF4,
which leads to downregulation of IRF8 by enhancing its proteasome-mediated
degradation. Further, si-RNA mediated knock-down of endogenous IRF4 results in a 
substantial reduction in proliferation of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell
lines (LCLs), as well as augmentation of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. IRF4
knockdown also showed reduced expression of its targeted downstream signalling
proteins which include CDK6, Cyclin B1 and c-Myc all critical for cell
proliferation. These studies provide novel insights into the contribution of
EBNA3C to EBV-mediated B-cell transformation through regulation of IRF4 and IRF8 
and add another molecular link to the mechanisms by which EBV dysregulates
cellular activities, increasing the potential for therapeutic intervention
against EBV-associated cancers.

Factors regulating microglia activation.

Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg Freiburg, Germany.

Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that
display high functional similarities to other tissue macrophages. However, it is 
especially important to create and maintain an intact tissue homeostasis to
support the neuronal cells, which are very sensitive even to minor changes in
their environment. The transition from the "resting" but surveying microglial
phenotype to an activated stage is tightly regulated by several intrinsic (e.g., 
Runx-1, Irf8, and Pu.1) and extrinsic factors (e.g., CD200, CX3CR1, and TREM2).
Under physiological conditions, minor changes of those factors are sufficient to 
cause fatal dysregulation of microglial cell homeostasis and result in severe CNS
pathologies. In this review, we discuss recent achievements that gave new
insights into mechanisms that ensure microglia quiescence.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential regulators of immune responses; however,
transcriptional mechanisms that establish DC lineage commitment are poorly
defined. Here, we report that the PU.1 transcription factor induces specific
remodeling of the higher-order chromatin structure at the interferon regulatory
factor 8 (Irf8) gene to initiate DC fate choice. An Irf8 reporter mouse enabled
us to pinpoint an initial progenitor stage at which DCs separate from other
myeloid lineages in the bone marrow. In the absence of Irf8, this progenitor
undergoes DC-to-neutrophil reprogramming, indicating that DC commitment requires 
an active, Irf8-dependent escape from alternative myeloid lineage potential.
Mechanistically, myeloid Irf8 expression depends on high PU.1 levels, resulting
in local chromosomal looping and activation of a lineage- and
developmental-stage-specific cis-enhancer. These data delineate PU.1 as a
concentration-dependent rheostat of myeloid lineage selection by controlling
long-distance contacts between regulatory elements and suggest that specific
higher-order chromatin remodeling at the Irf8 gene determines DC differentiation.

Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin loci represent frequent
oncogenic events in B-cell lymphoma development. Although IRF8 (ICSBP-1) protein 
expression has been demonstrated in germinal center B-cells and related lymphomas
in a single report, the IRF8 gene was not described as an immunoglobulin heavy
chain (IGH) translocation partner. In a discovery-driven approach we searched for
new translocation partners of IGH in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by
long distance inverse polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. 
A t(14;16)(q32.33;q24.1) IGH/IRF8 was detected in a CD5+de novo DLBCL, confirmed 
by translocation specific PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis. No further IRF8 aberration could be identified either by LDI-PCR in an 
additional five CD5+DLBCLs or by FISH on 78 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
biopsies. Subsequent screening for IRF8 by immunohistochemistry revealed IRF8
expression in 18/78 (23%), correlating with a germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)
type of DLBCL. This hitherto unknown translocation t(14;16)(q32.33;q24.1) is
likely to represent the initiator of a multistep lymphomagenesis in a CD5+de novo
DLBCL.

Pig immune response to general stimulus and to porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus infection: a meta-analysis approach.

BACKGROUND: The availability of gene expression data that corresponds to pig
immune response challenges provides compelling material for the understanding of 
the host immune system. Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and
expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of
independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In 
this study, we performed two meta-analyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i)
scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii)
determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome
Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to
PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the
common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways
specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was 
used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated
by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological
functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig
immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig
global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig
response to PRRSV infection, respectively.
RESULTS: The pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical 
pathways involved in the regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy
metabolism. Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred
around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post
transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation.
Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions,
associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors
such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially
involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to 
PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in
response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and
hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis
brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive
immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most
significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1,
which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other
transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and
IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals key genes, canonical pathways and biological
functions involved in the pig global immune response to diverse challenges,
including PRRSV infection. The powerful statistical approach led us to
consolidate previous findings as well as to gain new insights into the pig immune
response either to common stimuli or specifically to PRRSV infection.

Genetic determinants of susceptibility to Mycobacterial infections: IRF8, a new
kid on the block.

Salem S(1), Gros P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

Genetic and population studies suggest that onset, progression and ultimate
outcome of infection with Mycobacteria, including the agent of tuberculosis
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are strongly influenced by genetic factors.
Family-based and case-control linkage and association studies have suggested a
complex genetic component for susceptibility to tuberculosis. On the other hand, 
patients with inborn errors in the IL12/IFN<U+03B3> circuit may develop disseminated
mycobacterial infections following perinatal BCG vaccination. The study of such
MSMD (Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases) patients has provided
much insight into innate and acquired immune defenses against mycobacteria.
Parallel genetic analyses in mouse models of mycobacterial infections have also
indicated complex genetic control, and have provided candidate genes for parallel
testing in humans. Recently, mutations in human IRF8 were discovered and shown to
cause two distinct forms of a novel primary immunodeficiency and associated
susceptibility to mycobacteria. Autosomal recessive IRF8 deficiency is caused by 
mutation K108E and associated with severe disease with complete depletion of
monocytes and dendritic cells. Mutation T80A causes autosomal dominant IRF8
deficiency and a milder form of the disease with selective loss of a subset of
dendritic cells. These findings have established that IRF8 is required for
ontogeny of the myeloid lineage and for host response to mycobacteria. The
ongoing study of the IRF8 transcriptome has shown promise for the identification 
of IRF8 dependent pathways that play a critical role in host defense against
mycobacteria in particular, and against intracellular pathogens in general.

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) controls the activation of a subset of
AGC kinases. Using a conditional knockout of PDK1 in haematopoietic cells, we
demonstrate that PDK1 is essential for B cell development. B-cell progenitors
lacking PDK1 arrested at the transition of pro-B to pre-B cells, due to a cell
autonomous defect. Loss of PDK1 decreased the expression of the IgH chain in
pro-B cells due to impaired recombination of the IgH distal variable segments, a 
process coordinated by the transcription factor Pax5. The expression of Pax5 in
pre-B cells was decreased in PDK1 knockouts, which correlated with reduced
expression of the Pax5 target genes IRF4, IRF8 and Aiolos. As a result, Ccnd3 is 
upregulated in PDK1 knockout pre-B cells and they have an impaired ability to
undergo cell-cycle arrest, a necessary event for Ig light chain rearrangement.
Instead, these cells underwent apoptosis that correlated with diminished
expression of the pro-survival gene Bcl2A1. Reintroduction of both Pax5 and
Bcl2A1 together into PDK1 knockout pro-B cells restored their ability to
differentiate in vitro into mature B cells.

Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a
congenital malformation that leads to severe pulmonary hypertension and
respiratory failure. It has been associated with deletion of, or mutation in,
FOXF1 on 16q24.1, a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor expressed in
the mesenchyme of the developing lung. Here we report on the identification of a 
pericentric inversion on chromosome 16 (p11.2q24.1) in a case of lethal ACDMPV
with atrioventricular septal defect and duodenal atresia. Array-CGH indicated
that the inversion is balanced, and FISH showed that the q-arm breakpoint occurs 
134 ± 10 kb upstream (5'; centromeric) of FOXF1. This is suggestive of
cis-regulatory elements located more than 130 kb 5' of FOXF1, and analysis of
genome-wide data sets of chromatin modifications in two different cell types
suggested that the FOXF1 regulatory domain covers more than 300 kb, and perhaps
up to 433 kb, upstream of the gene, but only 3 kb downstream. The 588 kb
gene-free region between FOXF1 and the next gene in the centromeric direction,
IRF8, is highly conserved between species and divided into two distinct
regulatory domains by an insulator element. Another putative insulator occurs
just downstream of FOXF1. Our results further strengthen the association between 
FOXF1 and a spectrum of malformations that include ACDMPV, atrioventricular
septal defects, and gastrointestinal atresia. Furthermore, the presented analysis
aids in defining the critical genomic region for this syndrome.

In vitro evidence suggests that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are
intimately involved in the pathogenesis of lupus. However, it remains to be
determined whether these cells are required in vivo for disease development, and 
whether their contribution is restricted to hyperproduction of type I IFNs. To
address these issues, we created lupus-predisposed mice lacking the IFN
regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) or carrying a mutation that impairs the
peptide/histidine transporter solute carrier family 15, member 4 (SLC15A4).
IRF8-deficient NZB mice, lacking pDCs, showed almost complete absence of
anti-nuclear, anti-chromatin, and anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies, along with
reduced kidney disease. These effects were observed despite normal B-cell
responses to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 stimuli and intact humoral
responses to conventional T-dependent and -independent antigens. Moreover,
Slc15a4 mutant C57BL/6-Fas(lpr) mice, in which pDCs are present but unable to
produce type I IFNs in response to endosomal TLR ligands, also showed an absence 
of autoantibodies, reduced lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and extended
survival. Taken together, our results demonstrate that pDCs and the production of
type I IFNs by these cells are critical contributors to the pathogenesis of
lupus-like autoimmunity in these models. Thus, IRF8 and SLC15A4 may provide
important targets for therapeutic intervention in human lupus.

Neuropathic pain is a highly debilitating chronic pain state that is a
consequence of nerve injury or of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, infection,
autoimmune disease, or trauma. Neuropathic pain is often resistant to currently
available analgesics. There is a rapidly growing body of evidence indicating that
signalings from spinal microglia play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of
neuropathic pain. After peripheral nerve injury, microglia transform to reactive 
states through the expression of various genes such as cell-surface receptors
(including purinergic receptors) and proinflammatory cytokines that enhance
synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons. Inhibiting function or expression
of these microglial molecules strongly suppresses pain hypersensitivity to
innocuous mechanical stimuli (tactile allodynia), a hallmark symptom of
neuropathic pain. A recent study also reveals that the transcription factor IRF8 
(interferon regulatory factor 8) is a critical regulator of the nerve
injury-induced gene expression in microglia. The present review article
highlights the recent advances in our understanding of spinal microglia in
neuropathic pain.

Microglia are crucial for immune responses in the brain. Although their origin
from the yolk sac has been recognized for some time, their precise precursors and
the transcription program that is used are not known. We found that mouse
microglia were derived from primitive c-kit(+) erythromyeloid precursors that
were detected in the yolk sac as early as 8 d post conception. These precursors
developed into CD45(+) c-kit(lo) CX(3)CR1(-) immature (A1) cells and matured into
CD45(+) c-kit(-) CX(3)CR1(+) (A2) cells, as evidenced by the downregulation of
CD31 and concomitant upregulation of F4/80 and macrophage colony stimulating
factor receptor (MCSF-R). Proliferating A2 cells became microglia and invaded the
developing brain using specific matrix metalloproteinases. Notably,
microgliogenesis was not only dependent on the transcription factor Pu.1 (also
known as Sfpi), but also required Irf8, which was vital for the development of
the A2 population, whereas Myb, Id2, Batf3 and Klf4 were not required. Our data
provide cellular and molecular insights into the origin and development of
microglia.

We report here a de novo 16q24.1 interstitial duplication in a woman with a
severe phenotype consistent with mental retardation, spastic paraplegia, severe
epilepsy, a narrow and arched palate, malar hypoplasia, little subcutaneous fat
and arachnodactyly. Although conventional karyotyping was found to be normal,
array-CGH detected a small duplication on chromosome 16. Using QFM-PCR, we
characterised its proximal and distal breakpoints. The duplication, which is
approximately 250 kb, encompasses seven genes (KIAA0182, GINS2, c16orf74, COX4NB,
COX4I1, MIR1910 and IRF8). Several reports have previously described large 16q
duplications, and some of these overlap with our region in 16q24.1. Due to the
variability of the described phenotypes, the characterisation of small 16q
duplications may help to determine critical regions and the genes they contain
that are associated with the components of complex phenotypes.

Monocytes regulate host defenses, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis. The
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) stimulates
monocyte/macrophage differentiation, yet genome-wide understanding of the
differentiation program initiated by IRF8 is lacking. By combining chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing with gene expression profiling, we show that
during IRF8-dependent monocyte differentiation, IRF8 binding occurs at both
promoter-proximal and promotor-distal regions together with the transcription
factor PU.1 and is associated with gene induction. Many of the promoter-distal
IRF8 binding sites show an increase in histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation, a
signature for enhancers. However, about half the IRF8-induced genes were not
bound by IRF8, suggesting the involvement of downstream transcription factors.
Analysis of DNA motifs in cis-regulatory elements of these indirect IRF8 target
genes predicted that Krüppel-like factor-4 (KLF4)-essential for Ly6C(+) monocyte 
development-is one such factor. Indeed, monocyte development in Irf8(-/-) mice is
as defective as that in Klf4(-/-) chimeric mice. Moreover, Irf8(-/-)
monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors do not express Klf4 messenger RNA.
Introduction of KLF4 into an Irf8(-/-) myeloid progenitor cell line induced a
subset of IRF8 target genes and caused partial monocyte differentiation. Taken
together, our present results uncover genome-wide behavior of IRF8 and identify
an IRF8-KLF4 axis that operates during monocyte differentiation.

With white blood cell count emerging as an important risk factor for chronic
inflammatory diseases, genetic associations of differential leukocyte types,
specifically monocyte count, are providing novel candidate genes and pathways to 
further investigate. Circulating monocytes play a critical role in vascular
diseases such as in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. We performed a joint
and ancestry-stratified genome-wide association analyses to identify variants
specifically associated with monocyte count in 11 014 subjects in the electronic 
Medical Records and Genomics Network. In the joint and European ancestry samples,
we identified novel associations in the chromosome 16 interferon regulatory
factor 8 (IRF8) gene (P-value = 2.78×10(-16), ß = -0.22). Other monocyte
associations include novel missense variants in the chemokine-binding protein 2
(CCBP2) gene (P-value = 1.88×10(-7), ß = 0.30) and a region of replication found 
in ribophorin I (RPN1) (P-value = 2.63×10(-16), ß = -0.23) on chromosome 3. The
CCBP2 and RPN1 region is located near GATA binding protein2 gene that has been
previously shown to be associated with coronary heart disease. On chromosome 9,
we found a novel association in the prostaglandin reductase 1 gene (P-value =
2.29×10(-7), ß = 0.16), which is downstream from lysophosphatidic acid receptor
1. This region has previously been shown to be associated with monocyte count. We
also replicated monocyte associations of genome-wide significance (P-value =
5.68×10(-17), ß = -0.23) at the integrin, alpha 4 gene on chromosome 2. The novel
IRF8 results and further replications provide supporting evidence of genetic
regions associated with monocyte count.

BACKGROUND: Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) identified 4 highly correlated intronic variants within the IRF8
gene that were associated with CLL. These results were further supported by a
recent meta-analysis of our GWAS with two other GWAS of CLL, supporting the IRF8 
gene as a strong candidate for CLL risk.
METHODS: To refine the genetic association of CLL risk, we conducted Sanger
sequencing of IRF8 in 94 CLL cases and 96 controls. We then conducted fine
mapping by genotyping 39 variants (of which 10 were identified from sequencing)
in 745 CLL cases and 1,521 controls. We also assessed these associations with
risk of other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes.
RESULTS: The strongest association with CLL risk was observed with a common
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the 3' untranslated region
(UTR) of IRF8 (rs1044873, log additive OR = 0.7, P = 1.81 × 10(-6)). This SNP was
not associated with the other NHL subtypes (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that rs1044873 in the IRF8 gene accounts for the
initial GWAS signal for CLL risk. This association appears to be unique to CLL
with little support for association with other common NHL subtypes. Future work
is needed to assess functional role of IRF8 in CLL etiology.
IMPACT: These data provide support that a functional variant within the 3'UTR of 
IRF8 may be driving the GWAS signal seen on 16q24.1 for CLL risk.

CD8a+ DCs can be induced in the absence of transcription factors Id2, Nfil3, and

Antiviral immunity and cross-presentation is mediated constitutively through
CD8a+ and CD103+ DCs. Development of these DC subsets is thought to require the
transcription factors Irf8, Id2, Nfil3, and Batf3, although how this network is
regulated is poorly defined. We addressed the nature of the differentiation
blocks observed in the absence of these factors and found that although all 4
factors are required for CD103+ DC development, only Irf8 is essential for CD8a+ 
DCs. CD8a+ DCs emerged in the absence of Id2, Nfil3 and Batf3 in short-term bone 
marrow reconstitution. These induced CD8a+ DCs exhibit several hallmarks of
classic CD8a+ DCs including the expression of CD24, Tlr3, Xcr1, Clec9A, and the
capacity to cross-present soluble, cell-associated antigens and viral antigens
even in the absence of Batf3. Collectively, these results uncover a previously
undescribed pathway by which CD8a+ DCs emerge independent of Id2, Nfil3, and
Batf3, but dependent on Irf8.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of lymphoma in
adults. The disease exhibits a striking heterogeneity in gene expression profiles
and clinical outcomes, but its genetic causes remain to be fully defined. Through
whole genome and exome sequencing, we characterized the genetic diversity of
DLBCL. In all, we sequenced 73 DLBCL primary tumors (34 with matched normal DNA).
Separately, we sequenced the exomes of 21 DLBCL cell lines. We identified 322
DLBCL cancer genes that were recurrently mutated in primary DLBCLs. We identified
recurrent mutations implicating a number of known and not previously identified
genes and pathways in DLBCL including those related to chromatin modification
(ARID1A and MEF2B), NF-<U+03BA>B (CARD11 and TNFAIP3), PI3 kinase (PIK3CD, PIK3R1, and
MTOR), B-cell lineage (IRF8, POU2F2, and GNA13), and WNT signaling (WIF1). We
also experimentally validated a mutation in PIK3CD, a gene not previously
implicated in lymphomas. The patterns of mutation demonstrated a classic long
tail distribution with substantial variation of mutated genes from patient to
patient and also between published studies. Thus, our study reveals the
tremendous genetic heterogeneity that underlies lymphomas and highlights the need
for personalized medicine approaches to treating these patients.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of many cellular
responses, through the action of miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC)- or
miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (miRNP)-mediated gene repression. Here we studied
the role of miRNAs in the development of dendritic cells (DCs), an important
immune cell type that is divided into conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC
(pDC) subsets. We found that miR-22 was highly expressed in mouse CD11c(+)
CD11b(+) B220(-) cDCs compared to pDCs, and was induced in DC progenitor cell
cultures with GM-CSF, which stimulate CD11c(+) CD11b(+) B220(-) cDC
differentiation. Enforced overexpression of miR-22 during DC development enhanced
CD11c(+) CD11b(+) B220(-) cDC generation at the expense of pDCs, while miR-22
knockdown demonstrated opposite effects. Moreover, overexpression and knockdown
of miR-22 showed significant effects on the mRNA abundance of Irf8, which encodes
the transcription factor IRF8 that plays essential roles in DC development.
Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-22 binds directly to the 3'UTR of
the mouse Irf8 mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-22 targets Irf8
mRNA for posttranscriptional repression and controls DC subset differentiation.

OBJECTIVES: In resected buccal cancer patients, an unexpected close surgical
margin has been observed to correlate with poor clinical outcomes. However, close
surgical margin alone does not independently guide post-operative therapies,
revealing a clinical debate. Hence, the present study intended to explore
epigenetic-based bio-predictors for further stratifying this debating patient
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2008, we retrospectively recruited 44
resected buccal cancer patients with a close surgical margin of =5 mm. All
patients had post-operative radiotherapy. Genomic DNA was extracted from
tumor-enrich areas that contained cancer cells of >70%. Methylation-specific PCR 
was performed to detect promoter methylation of four tumor suppressor genes,
including RASSF1A, DAPK, IRF8, and SFRP1. Post-irradiation locoregional control
was defined as the primary end point.
RESULTS: There were 40 males and 4 females, with a median age of 53.5 years
(range, 32-82 years). Multivariate analysis identified two independent predictors
for locoregional recurrence: very close margin of =1 mm (HR: 4.96; 95% CI,
1.63-15.09; P=0.018) and promoter hypermethylation of DAPK (HR: 2.83; 95% CI,
1.05-7.63; P=0.042). The highest risk of locoregional recurrence was observed in 
patients with both of the two factors (HR, 8.05; 95% CI, 2.56-25.82; P=0.002)
when compared with patients with none. Shorter disease-free survival, but not
overall survival, was also observed.
CONCLUSION: More aggressive managements should be considered in resected buccal
cancer patients with both very close margin and DAPK promoter hypermethylation
rather than post-operative observation or radiotherapy alone.

cells.

Aberrant CD40 expression by dendritic cells (DCs), induced by microbial stimuli, 
such as CpG, contributes to the pathogenesis of many human/murine diseases,
particularly autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Given the importance of CD40
in these diseases, and the contribution of DCs to the diseases process, it is
very important to investigate the mechanisms of CD40 expression induced by CpG on
DCs. In this study, we made the observation that CpG-B is a potent inducer on
CD40 expression on murine bone marrow-derived DCs. Based on this finding, we
undertook an analysis of the molecular basis of CpG-induced CD40 expression on
DCs. By using selective inhibitors, it was demonstrated that MAPKs (JNK and p38
MAPK but not ERK) and NF-<U+03BA>B were involved in CpG-induced CD40 expression on DCs. 
In addition, RNA interference analysis revealed that IRF8 was a key transcription
factor in the basal expression of CD40 upon CpG stimulation. Moreover,
up-regulating miRNA-146a in DCs effectively decreased CD40 expression by
targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1. Thus, our results have elucidated the molecular
mechanisms underlying CpG-induced CD40 expression and DC maturation.

IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 8 is a transcription factor that has a key role in
the cellular response to IFN-<U+03B3> and is pivotal in myeloid cell differentiation.
Whether IRF8 plays a role in the development and function of microglia, the
tissue-resident myeloid cells of the brain, is unknown. Here, we show IRF8 is a
constitutively produced nuclear factor in microglia, which suggested that IRF8
might also be a key homeostatic transcriptional determinant of the microglial
cell phenotype. In support of this, in mice with a targeted disruption of the
IRF8 gene, microglia were increased in number and showed gross alterations in
morphology and surface area. In situ analysis of some key myeloid markers
revealed that IRF8-deficient microglia had significantly reduced levels of Iba1, 
but increased levels of CD206 (mannose receptor) and F4/80 as well as increased
tomato lectin binding. Analysis of microglia ex vivo revealed IRF8-deficient
microglia had significantly increased levels of CD45, CD11b and F4/80, but
significantly decreased levels of the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5 and CX3CR1. 
The known involvement of some of these molecular markers in membrane dynamics and
phagocytosis led us to examine the phagocytic capacity of cultured IRF8-deficient
microglia, however, this was found to be similar to wild type microglia. We
conclude IRF8 is a constitutively produced nuclear factor in resident microglia
of the CNS being a crucial transcriptional determinant of the phenotype of these 
cells in the healthy brain.

The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for 
germinal center (GC) formation and whose de-regulation is involved in
lymphomagenesis. Although substantial evidence indicates that BCL6 exerts its
function by repressing the transcription of hundreds of protein-coding genes, its
potential role in regulating gene expression via microRNAs (miRNAs) is not known.
We have identified a core of 15 miRNAs that show binding of BCL6 in their genomic
loci and are down-regulated in GC B cells. Among BCL6 validated targets, miR-155 
and miR-361 directly modulate AID expression, indicating that via repression of
these miRNAs, BCL6 up-regulates AID. Similarly, the expression of additional
genes relevant for the GC phenotype, including SPI1, IRF8, and MYB, appears to be
sustained via BCL6-mediated repression of miR-155. These findings identify a
novel mechanism by which BCL6, in addition to repressing protein coding genes,
promotes the expression of important GC functions by repressing specific miRNAs.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the principal component of Gram-negative bacterial cell
walls, is a stimulator of osteoclastogenesis and thus a key factor in
inflammatory bone loss. We have recently reported that the important cholesterol 
and inflammatory regulator, liver X receptor (LXRa/ß), can potently inhibit
osteoclast formation from bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors in a
bacterial/LPS environment. In this manuscript, we further studied the effect of
the LXR agonist GW3965 on osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 promyelocytic
leukemia cells exposed to LPS. We found that not only did activation of the LXR
potently inhibit the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells, but
promoted a population of TRAP-negative mononuclear cells with high phagocytic
activity. We observed reduced expression of the osteoclast markers TRAP/Acp5,
Ctsk, Calcr and Oscar after 3-4days of GW3965 treatment, coinciding with an
increase in the expression of the anti-osteoclastogenic factor Irf8. Expression
of the macrophage/phagocytic marker Cd68 was increased, however the "classical"
macrophage markers F4/80 and Cd14 and the "alternatively" activated macrophage
markers Tgfß and Il10 were not altered. Further, activation of LXR increased the 
expression of the macrophage survival gene AIM/SPa, a known LXR target gene, and 
osteoclast/macrophage-related markers (Mitf, Pu.1, Usf1/2, Ostm1 and Mfr).
Although Akt phosphorylation was reduced, GW3965 seemed to act independently of
MAPKs (p38, ERK, JNK) and NF<U+03BA>B, and had no inhibitory effect on cytokine
expression (Tnfa, Il6, or Il1ß). Our results indicate that activation of the LXR 
not only inhibits the differentiation of osteoclast-like cells from RAW264.7
cells in a bacterial/LPS environment, but is also involved in the fate
determination of myeloid progenitor cells into macrophages with high phagocytic
capacity.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease for which multiple
susceptibility genes have been reported. Genome-wide association studies have
shown that large numbers of susceptibility genes are shared among autoimmune
diseases. Recently, our group identified 9 novel susceptibility genes associated 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Japanese population. The aim of this study
was to elucidate whether the 18 genes that displayed associations or suggestive
associations for RA in our previous study are associated with SSc in Japanese.
METHODS: We performed an association study that included 415 patients with SSc
and 16,891 control subjects, followed by a replication study that included 315
patients and 21,054 control subjects. The 18 markers reported to display
association with RA were analyzed for their associations with SSc in the first
study, and 5 markers were further analyzed in the replication study. The inverse 
variance method was used to evaluate the associations of these markers with SSc
in a combined study.
RESULTS: In the phospholipase D4 gene (PLD4), rs2841277 displayed a significant
association with SSc in Japanese patients (P = 0.00017). We observed that
rs2841280 in exon 2 of PLD4 was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2841277
and introduced an amino acid alteration. We also observed associations between
SSc and rs6932056 in TNFAIP3 and rs2280381 in IRF8 (P = 0.0000095 and P = 0.0030,
respectively), both of which displayed associations with SSc in a European
population.
CONCLUSION: We determined that PLD4 is a novel susceptibility gene for SSc in
Japanese, thus confirming the involvement of PLD4 in autoimmunity. Associations
between SSc and TNFAIP3 or IRF8 were also detected in our Japanese population.
SSc and RA appear to share relatively large proportions of their genetic
backgrounds.

The objective of this study was to investigate expression of interferon
regulatory factors (ICSBP/IRF8) and the potential role of DNA methylation in
silencing ICSBP/IRF8 gene in multiple myeloma (MM) cell line U266 and bone marrow
mononuclear cells from 10 MM patients (MM-BMMNC). The bone marrow mononuclear
cells from 10 healthy persons (N-BMMNC) were collected and used as normal
controls. Expression of ICSBP/IRF8 gene was detected by real-time fluorescence
quantitative PCR (using 2(-<U+0394><U+0394>CT) to calculate); DNA methylation level of the
ICSBP/IRF8 gene was measured using methylation-specific PCR (using the ratio of
interest gene ICSBP/IRF8 and internal reference ß-actin expression as results).
The results showed that as compared with N-BMMNC the lower expression of
ICSBP/IRF8 gene was found in U266 cells and MM-BMMNC, the hypermethylation of the
CpG island in the ICSBP/IRF8 promoter was observed, there were significant
differences between N-BMMNC and MM-BMMNC or U266 cells (P < 0.05). It is
concluded that the expression of ICSBP/IRF8 gene can be silenced in the MM-BMMNC 
and U226 cells. As the hypermethylation of CpG island in ICSBP/IRF8 promoter is a
frequent event in MM cells, the ICSBP/IRF8 gene silencing caused by DNA
methylation may take part in the pathogenesis and development of MM.

To recognize patients with inhibitory and neutralizing auto-antibodies to
interferon-<U+03B3> (AutoAbs-IFN-<U+03B3>) presenting with the sporadic phenotype of Mendelian 
Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD) mainly characterized by recurrent 
intracellular mycobacterium or/and salmonella infections, we comprehensively
investigated IL12/23-IFN-<U+03B3> signaling, candidate genetic sequencings or/and
protein expressions of IL12RB1, IFNRG1, IL12p40, IFNRG2, STAT1, IKKA, NEMO, CYBB 
and IRF8 in four patients. Their serum was further titrated to detect
AutoAbs-IFN-<U+03B3>, for which the biological activity was assessed in Jurkat T cells. 
The patients mainly presented with recurrent non-tuberculous mycobacterium
osteomyelitis and lymphadenopathy (Mycobacterium abscessus, chelonae and avium
intracellular complex), and salmonella sepsis (S. enterica serogroup B, C2 and
D). Additionally, Penicillium marneffei, varicella-zoster virus, and herpes
simplex virus infections occurred. Inhibitory and neutralizing IFN-<U+03B3> downstream
signaling was elucidated in Jurkat cell lines as decreased MHC class I and
phosphorylated STAT1 expression. Together with 24 patients from the PubMed
search, the majority of the AutoAbs-IFN-<U+03B3> patients were Asian (25/28). The most
common involvement was lymph nodes (in 22/28), lungs (19/28) and bones (12/28).
Mycobacterium avium complex (in 14) and chelonae (7) were the most common
pathogens from 40 isolations. In contrast to those with the mild form of MSMD
phenotype, AutoAbs-IFN-<U+03B3> patients, in the absence of BCG-induced diseases, had a 
more persistent course and poor response to IFN-<U+03B3> treatment. In conclusion,
AutoAbs-IFN-<U+03B3> patients may have a sporadic adult-onset MSMD phenotype in Asian
regions endemic for mycobacterial infections.

Interferon regulatory factor 8/interferon consensus sequence binding protein is a
critical transcription factor for the physiological phenotype of microglia.

BACKGROUND: Recent fate-mapping studies establish that microglia, the resident
mononuclear phagocytes of the CNS, are distinct in origin from the bone
marrow-derived myeloid lineage. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8, also known 
as interferon consensus sequence binding protein) plays essential roles in
development and function of the bone marrow-derived myeloid lineage. However,
little is known about its roles in microglia.
METHODS: The CNS tissues of IRF8-deficient mice were immunohistochemically
analyzed. Pure microglia isolated from wild-type and IRF8-deficient mice were
studied in vitro by proliferation, immunocytochemical and phagocytosis assays.
Microglial response in vivo was compared between wild-type and IRF8-deficient
mice in the cuprizon-induced demyelination model.
RESULTS: Our analysis of IRF8-deficient mice revealed that, in contrast to
compromised development of IRF8-deficient bone marrow myeloid lineage cells,
development and colonization of microglia are not obviously affected by loss of
IRF8. However, IRF8-deficient microglia demonstrate several defective phenotypes.
In vivo, IRF8-deficient microglia have fewer elaborated processes with reduced
expression of IBA1/AIF1 compared with wild-type microglia, suggesting a defective
phenotype. IRF8-deficient microglia are significantly less proliferative in mixed
glial cultures than wild-type microglia. Unlike IRF8-deficient bone marrow
myeloid progenitors, exogenous macrophage colony stimulating factor (colony
stimulating factor 1) (M-CSF (CSF1)) restores their proliferation in mixed glial 
cultures. In addition, IRF8-deficient microglia exhibit an exaggerated growth
response to exogenous granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (colony
stimulating factor 2) (GM-CSF (CSF2)) in the presence of other glial cells.
IRF8-deficient microglia also demonstrate altered cytokine expressions in
response to interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide in vitro. Moreover, the
maximum phagocytic capacity of IRF8-deficient microglia is reduced, although
their engulfment of zymosan particles is not overtly impaired. Defective
scavenging activity of IRF8-deficient microglia was further confirmed in vivo in 
the cuprizone-induced demyelination model in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate the essential contribution of
IRF8-mediated transcription to a broad range of microglial phenotype. Microglia
are distinct from the bone marrow myeloid lineage with respect to their
dependence on IRF8-mediated transcription.

Associations of CD6, TNFRSF1A and IRF8 polymorphisms with risk of inflammatory
demyelinating diseases.

Park TJ(1), Kim HJ, Kim JH, Bae JS, Cheong HS, Park BL, Shin HD.

AIMS: Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are inflammatory
autoimmune diseases that affect the central nervous system. Several genome-wide
and candidate gene studies have identified genetic polymorphisms associated with 
the risk of MS or NMO. In particular, two recently published studies of
meta-analysis in European-origin populations have suggested associations of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD6, TNFRSF1A and IRF8 with MS. The aim
of our study was to assess the associations between SNPs in these three genes and
the risk of inflammatory demyelinating disease (IDD) including MS and NMO. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a study has been performed in 
an Asian population.
METHODS: A total of 21 SNPs of CD6, TNFRSF1A and IRF8 were genotyped in 178 IDD
cases (79 MS and 99 NMO patients) and 237 normal controls in a Korean population.
RESULTS: Logistic analyses revealed that one SNP in CD6 (rs12288280, P = 0.04)
and three SNPs in TNFRSF1A (rs767455, rs4149577 and rs1800693, P = 0.01-0.03)
were associated with NMO. However, there was no association of IRF8 polymorphisms
with IDD, including MS and NMO. Using further information from the SNP Function
Prediction website, two exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), including the
polymorphic site of rs767455, were predicted to be binding sites for splicing
factors (SRp55, SF2/ASF2 and SF2/ASF1).
CONCLUSION: Although additional studies are needed, our findings could provide
information regarding the genetic aetiology of IDD in the Korean population.

The AP1 transcription factor Batf3 is required for homeostatic development of
CD8a(+) classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell responses against
intracellular pathogens. Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent
pathway in mice for CD8a(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12
and interferon-<U+03B3>. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation
for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and
B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally,
physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for
expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the
shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors 
such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably,
manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of
value in augmenting immune responses to vaccines.

Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and IRF8 regulate B, T, macrophage, and
dendritic cell differentiation. They are recruited to cis-regulatory Ets-IRF
composite elements by PU.1 or Spi-B. How these IRFs target genes in most T cells 
is enigmatic given the absence of specific Ets partners. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing in T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells reveals that IRF4
targets sequences enriched for activating protein 1 (AP-1)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are co-bound by BATF, an AP-1 factor required for T(H)17, B, and
dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind cooperatively to structurally 
divergent AICEs to promote gene activation and T(H)17 differentiation. The AICE
motif directs assembly of IRF4 or IRF8 with BATF heterodimers and is also used in
T(H)2, B, and dendritic cells. This genomic regulatory element and cognate
factors appear to have evolved to integrate diverse immunomodulatory signals.

Macrophages, when activated by IFN-<U+03B3> and TLR signaling, elicit innate immune
responses. IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor that
facilitates macrophage activation and innate immunity. We show that, in resting
macrophages, some IRF8 is conjugated to small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) 2/3
through the lysine residue 310. SUMO3-conjugated IRF8 failed to induce IL12p40
and other IRF8 target genes, consistent with SUMO-mediated transcriptional
repression reported for other transcription factors. SUMO3-conjugated IRF8 showed
reduced mobility in live nuclei and bound poorly to the IL12p40 gene. However,
macrophage activation caused a sharp reduction in the amount of SUMOylated IRF8. 
This reduction coincided with the induction of a deSUMOylating enzyme,
sentrin-specific peptidase 1 (SENP1), in activated macrophages. In transfection
analysis, SENP1 removed SUMO3 from IRF8 and enhanced expression of IL12p40 and
other target genes. Conversely, SENP1 knockdown repressed IRF8 target gene
expression. In parallel with IRF8 deSUMOylation, macrophage activation led to the
induction of proteins active in the SUMO pathway and caused a global shift in
nuclear protein SUMOylation patterns. Together, the IRF8 SUMO
conjugation/deconjugation switch is part of a larger transition in SUMO
modifications that takes place upon macrophage activation, serving as a mechanism
to trigger innate immune responses.

The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) members IRF4 and IRF8 contribute to
B-lymphocyte development and can act as regulators of immunoglobulin (Ig) light
chain gene transcription. These two IRFs are closely interrelated and are
expressed at high levels in the lymphoid and myeloid cells of the immune system. 
In this study, the complete cDNA and genomic sequences of rock bream IRF4
(RbIRF4) and IRF8 (RbIRF8) were identified by homology screening of a
multi-tissue normalized cDNA library and a BAC library, respectively, which had
been established using Roche 454 GS-FLX technology. The full-length RbIRF4 cDNA 
is composed of 3442 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 462 amino acids; the genomic 
DNA is 9262 bp in length, consisting of eight exons and seven introns. The
full-length RbIRF8 cDNA is composed of 2186 bp and encodes a 422 amino acid
polypeptide; the genomic DNA is 4120 bp in length, consisting of nine exons and
eight introns. The deduced amino acid sequences of RbIRF4 and RbIRF8 include a
conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) encompassing a tryptophan pentad-repeat and an
IRF-association domain (IAD). Several putative transcription factor binding sites
were also identified in 5' flanking region of both RbIRF4 and RbIRF8, and include
those of immune-related factors. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of healthy
rock bream detected the highest expression levels of RbIRF4 and RbIRF8 in
lymphomyeloid-rich tissues. In addition, viral (rock bream iridovirus) and
bacterial (Edwardsiella tarda and Streptococcus iniae) infection stimulated
RbIRF4 and RbIRF8 expressions in head kidney and spleen. These results suggest
not only that RbIRF4 and RbIRF8 may have a protective function against virus and 
bacteria pathogen invasion in rock bream, but also that IRFs may be
immunomodulatory factors of teleost fish.

Genes encoding IRF1 and IRF8 protein have been proposed as candidate tuberculosis
susceptibility genes. In order to elucidate whether the IRF1 and IRF8 variants
were associated with tuberculosis susceptibility, we conducted a case-control
study consisting of 495 controls and 452 ethnically matched cases with
tuberculosis in a Chinese population. Seven haplotype tagging single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs2057656; rs2706381; rs2070724; rs2070721; rs2549008;
rs2549007; rs2706386) from HapMap database were analyzed, which provided an
almost complete coverage of the genetic variations in the IRF1 gene. Fifteen
tagSNPs (rs12924316; rs182511; rs305080; rs2292980; rs925994; rs424971;
rs16939967; rs11117415; rs4843860; rs9926411; rs8064189; rs12929551; rs10514611; 
rs1044873; rs6638) were observed in the IRF8 gene. All these tagSNPs were
genotyped by SNPstream genotyping and SNaPshot typing. None of the seven tagSNPs 
was individually associated with tuberculosis in the IRF1 gene. In the IRF8 gene,
interestingly, we found that three tagSNPs (rs925994 and rs11117415 located in
the intron region; rs10514611 located in the 3'UTR) were associated with risk of 
tuberculosis after Bonferroni correction. Per allele OR was 1.75 (95% CI 1.35 ~
2.27, P = 0.002), 4.75 (95% CI 2.16 ~ 10.43, P = 0.002) and 3.39 (95% CI 1.60 ~
7.20, P = 0.015) respectively. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the
construct that contained the non-risk allele C of rs10514611 showed significantly
higher luciferase activity than did the risk T allele (P<0.01), which implied
rs10514611 was a potential functional SNP site. Our results indicated that the
IRF8 gene might participate in genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis in a
Chinese population.

IRF8 is a critical transcription factor for transforming microglia into a
reactive phenotype.

Microglia become activated by multiple types of damage in the nervous system and 
play essential roles in neuronal pathologies. However, how microglia transform
into reactive phenotypes is poorly understood. Here, we identify the
transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as a critical
regulator of reactive microglia. Within the spinal cord, IRF8 expression was
normally low; however, the expression was markedly upregulated in microglia, but 
not in neurons or astrocytes, after peripheral nerve injury (PNI). IRF8
overexpression in cultured microglia promoted the transcription of genes
associated with reactive states; conversely, IRF8 deficiency prevented these gene
expressions in the spinal cord following PNI. Furthermore, IRF8-deficient mice
were resistant to neuropathic pain, a common sequela of PNI, and transferring
IRF8-overexpressing microglia spinally to normal mice produced pain. Therefore,
IRF8 may activate a program of gene expression that transforms microglia into a
reactive phenotype. Our findings provide a newly observed mechanism for
microglial activation.

STAT1 exists in phosphorylated (pSTAT1) and unphosphorylated (uSTAT1) forms each 
regulated by IFN-<U+03B3>. Although STAT1 is a key mediator of the IFN-<U+03B3> signaling
pathway, an essential component of the host cancer immunosurveillance system,
STAT1 is also overexpressed in certain human cancers where the functions of
pSTAT1 and uSTAT1 are ill defined. Using a murine model of soft tissue sarcoma
(STS), we show that disruption of the IFN effector molecule IRF8 decreases pSTAT1
and increases uSTAT1 in STS cells, thereby increasing their metastatic potential.
We determined that the IRF8 gene promoter was hypermethylated frequently in human
STS. An analysis of 123 human STS specimens revealed that high uSTAT1 levels in
tumor cells was correlated with a reduction in disease-specific survival (DSS),
whereas high pSTAT1 levels in tumor cells were correlated with an increase in
DSS. In addition, uSTAT1 levels were negatively correlated with pSTAT1 levels in 
these STS specimens. Mechanistic investigations revealed that IRF8 suppressed
STAT1 transcription by binding the STAT1 promoter. RNAi-mediated silencing of
STAT1 in STS cells was sufficient to increase expression of the apoptotic
mediators Fas and Bad and to elevate the sensitivity of STS cells to Fas-mediated
apoptosis. Together, our findings show how the phosphorylation status of pSTAT1
determines its function as a tumor suppressor, with uSTAT1 acting as a tumor
promoter that acts by elevating resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis to promote
immune escape.

pathways and drives effector differentiation of CD8 T cells.

We recently demonstrated that differentiation of cytotoxic T cells requires
cooperation between T-cell receptor (TCR)/costimulation and <U+03B3>c-cytokines. Here we
demonstrate that the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is
expressed in CD8 T cells by the combination of these two signals. More
importantly, depletion of IRF8 in these cells abrogated the differentiation of
naive CD8 T cells into effector cells in an experimental graft-vs.-host disease
mouse model. We also show that IRF8 seems to not operate upstream of other
critical factors such as T-bet and eomesodermin, which have been implicated in
effector maturation. Collectively, our work shows that IRF8 integrates the
TCR/costimulation and <U+03B3>c-cytokine-signaling pathways and mediates the transition 
of naive CD8 T cells to effector cells, thus identifying IRF8 as one of the
molecular regulators of CD8 T-cell differentiation.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) in mammals is known to be involved in
antiviral response. In this study, the gene of IRF8 was cloned from the turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus) fish and its expression in response to
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and turbot reddish body irrdovirus
(TRBIV) challenges was studied. Turbot (Sm)IRF8 gene is 4363bp long, comprises
nine exons and eight introns and encodes a putative 420 amino acid (aa) protein. 
The predicted protein sequence possesses a DNA binding domain (DBD), an IRF
association domain (IAD) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Constitutive
expression of SmIRF8 was detectable in all tested organs, with higher levels
observed in the spleen, kidney and head kidney. SmIRF8 transcript levels were
up-regulated by both poly I:C and TRBIV treatments in the spleen, head kidney,
gills and muscle in an early phase of a 7-day time course and the poly I:C was a 
quicker inducer. In both challenge cases, the highest and earliest inductions
were detected in the spleen, while the induction in the muscle was quite faint.
These results provide insights into the role of SmIRF8 in antiviral response.

Mature B cell differentiation involves a well-established transcription factor
cascade. However, the temporal dynamics of cell signaling pathways regulating
transcription factor network and coordinating cell proliferation and
differentiation remain poorly defined. To gain insight into the molecular
processes and extrinsic cues required for B cell differentiation, we set up a
controlled primary culture system to differentiate human naive B cells into
plasma cells (PCs). We identified T cell-produced IL-2 to be critically involved 
in ERK1/2-triggered PC differentiation. IL-2 drove activated B cell
differentiation toward PC independently of its proliferation and survival
functions. Indeed, IL-2 potentiated ERK activation and subsequent BACH2 and IRF8 
downregulation, sustaining BLIMP1 expression, the master regulator for PC
differentiation. Inhibition of the MAPK-ERK pathway, unlike STAT5 signaling,
impaired IL-2-induced PC differentiation and rescued the expression profile of
BACH2 and IRF8. These results identify IL-2 as a crucial early input in mature B 
cell fate commitment.

Emerging concepts suggest that the functional phenotype of macrophages is
regulated by transcription factors that define alternative activation states. We 
found that RBP-J, the main nuclear transducer of signaling via Notch receptors,
augmented Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced expression of key mediators of
classically activated M1 macrophages and thus of innate immune responses to
Listeria monocytogenes. Notch-RBP-J signaling controlled expression of the
transcription factor IRF8 that induced downstream M1 macrophage-associated genes.
RBP-J promoted the synthesis of IRF8 protein by selectively augmenting kinase
IRAK2-dependent signaling via TLR4 to the kinase MNK1 and downstream
translation-initiation control through eIF4E. Our results define a signaling
network in which signaling via Notch-RBP-J and TLRs is integrated at the level of
synthesis of IRF8 protein and identify a mechanism by which heterologous
signaling pathways can regulate the TLR-induced inflammatory polarization of
macrophages.

OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory leukocyte accumulation drives atherosclerosis. Although
monocytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (PMN)
contribute to lesion formation, sequelae of myeloproliferative disease remain to 
be elucidated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used mice deficient in interferon regulatory factor 8
(IRF8(-/-)) in hematopoietic cells that develop a chronic myelogenous
leukemia-like phenotype. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice reconstituted with
IRF8(-/-) or IRF8(-/-) apolipoprotein E-deficient bone marrow displayed an
exacerbated atherosclerotic lesion formation compared with controls. The chronic 
myelogenous leukemia-like phenotype in mice with IRF8(-/-) bone marrow, reflected
by an expansion of PMN in the circulation, was associated with an increased
lesional accumulation and apoptosis of PMN, and enlarged necrotic cores.
IRF8(-/-) compared with IRF8(+/+) PMN displayed unaffected reactive oxygen
species formation and discharge of PMN granule components. In contrast,
accumulating in equal numbers at sites of inflammation, IRF8(-/-) macrophages
were defective in efferocytosis, lipid uptake, and interleukin-10 cytokine
production. Importantly, depletion of PMN in low-density lipoprotein receptor or 
apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with IRF8(-/-) or IRF8(-/-) apolipoprotein
E-deficient bone marrow abrogated increased lesion formation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like
phenotype contributes to accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. Among
proatherosclerotic effects of other cell types, this, in part, is linked to an
expansion of functionally intact PMN.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic heterogeneous autoimmune disorder
characterized by the loss of tolerance to self-antigens and dysregulated
interferon responses. The etiology of SLE is complex, involving both heritable
and environmental factors. Candidate-gene studies and genome-wide association
(GWA) scans have been successful in identifying new loci that contribute to
disease susceptibility; however, much of the heritable risk has yet to be
identified. In this study, we sought to replicate 1,580 variants showing
suggestive association with SLE in a previously published GWA scan of European
Americans; we tested a multiethnic population consisting of 7,998 SLE cases and
7,492 controls of European, African American, Asian, Hispanic, Gullah, and
Amerindian ancestry to find association with the disease. Several genes relevant 
to immunological pathways showed association with SLE. Three loci exceeded the
genome-wide significance threshold: interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8;
rs11644034; p(meta-Euro) = 2.08 × 10(-10)), transmembrane protein 39A (TMEM39A;
rs1132200; p(meta-all) = 8.62 × 10(-9)), and 17q21 (rs1453560; p(meta-all) =
3.48 × 10(-10)) between IKAROS family of zinc finger 3 (AIOLOS; IKZF3) and zona
pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2). Fine mapping, resequencing, imputation, and 
haplotype analysis of IRF8 indicated that three independent effects tagged by
rs8046526, rs450443, and rs4843869, respectively, were required for risk in
individuals of European ancestry. Eleven additional replicated effects (5 ×
10(-8) < p(meta-Euro) < 9.99 × 10(-5)) were observed with CFHR1, CADM2,
LOC730109/IL12A, LPP, LOC63920, SLU7, ADAMTSL1, C10orf64, OR8D4, FAM19A2, and
STXBP6. The results of this study increase the number of confirmed SLE risk loci 
and identify others warranting further investigation.

Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRN) control the underlying mechanisms
behind cellular functions and they are defined by a set of core transcription
factors regulating cascades of peripheral genes. Here we report SPI1, CEBPA, MNDA
and IRF8 as core transcription factors of monocyte TRN and demonstrate functional
inductions of phagocytosis, inflammatory response and chemotaxis activities in
human dermal fibroblasts. The Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses also
revealed notable representation of genes involved in immune response and
endocytosis in fibroblasts. Moreover, monocyte TRN-inducers triggered multiple
monocyte-specific genes based on the transcription factor motif response analysis
and suggest that complex cellular TRNs are uniquely amenable to elicit
cell-specific functions in unrelated cell types.

The immunobiology of Ro52 (TRIM21) in autoimmunity: a critical review.

Ro52 is a common target of circulating autoantibodies in autoimmune disease. Data
indicate that anti-Ro52 antibodies are associated with distinct clinical
manifestations. It is therefore of major interest to understand how it becomes an
antigenic target and what cells express this protein under what conditions and
what cellular function it has. Ro52 contains a RING and a B-box motif, followed
by a coiled-coil domain and a B30.2 (or PRYSPRY) region in the C-terminal end.
This molecular structure places Ro52 within the family of tripartite motif
proteins (TRIM), and it is also denoted TRIM21. Like several other TRIM proteins,
Ro52 has E3 ligase activity and functions in the process of ubiquitination. Ro52 
is expressed in the immune system as a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that can
be upregulated and translocate to the nucleus in a proinflammatory environment.
Reported substrates for Ro52-mediated ubiquitination include IRF3, IRF5, IRF7 and
IRF8, and via these transcription factors Ro52 regulates type 1 interferon and
cytokine production. Ro52 is upregulated at the site of autoimmune inflammation, 
such as cutaneous lupus lesions. This implies that Ro52 may have an important
role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, and this paper will review the
available data on the role of Ro52 in immune responses and autoimmune
pathogenesis.

Although neurological sequelae are attributable to poor regeneration of the
central nervous system, oligodendrocytes demonstrate robust regenerative response
even in adults. Accumulating evidence indicates that the glial cells identified
by surface expression of the proteoglycan NG2 are the cellular source of
newly-developed oligodendrocytes following demyelination, and thereby considered 
adult oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs). Despite their robust regenerative
capability, remyelination often ends up in failure or is incomplete, particularly
after recurrent neuroinflammation, which is referred to as "remyelination
failure". While axonal degeneration may contribute to remyelination failure, OPCs
are also affected by neuroinflammation. Indeed, various studies have indicated
that gamma-interferon, a proinflammatory cytokine associated with autoimmunity,
is cytotoxic to OPCs by inducing cell death, and inhibiting their proliferation
and differentiation. In contrast to gamma-interferon, we confirmed that
beta-interferon which is used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis does not induce OPC death. Through a comprehensive analysis of
gamma-interferon-inducible and beta-interferon-inducible genes in OPCs, we have
identified interferon regulatory factor-1 and -8 (IRF1 and IRF8) as candidate
transcription factors responsible for gamma-interferon-mediated cytotoxicity in
OPCs. Validating and elaborating on these findings particularly in in vivo models
may prove of importance in understanding remyelination failure and suggest
therapeutic approaches to enhance remyelination.

Immune defects in active mycobacterial diseases in patients with primary
immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs).

Natural human immunity to the mycobacteria group, including Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM),
and/or Salmonella species, relies on the functional IL-12/23-IFN-<U+03B3> integrity of
macrophages (monocyte/dendritic cell) connecting to T lymphocyte/NK cells.
Patients with severe forms of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) have more 
profound immune defects involving this impaired circuit in patients with severe
combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) including complete DiGeorge syndrome, X-linked
hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM) (CD40L mutation), CD40 deficiency, immunodeficiency
with or without anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (NEMO and IKBA mutations),
chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and hyper IgE recurrent infection syndromes
(HIES). The patients with severe PIDs have broader diverse infections rather than
mycobacterial infections. In contrast, patients with an isolated inborn error of 
the IL-12/23-IFN-<U+03B3> pathway are exclusively prone to low-virulence mycobacterial
infections and nontyphoid salmonella infections, known as Mendelian
susceptibility to the mycobacterial disease (MSMD) phenotype. Restricted
defective molecules in the circuit, including IFN-<U+03B3>R1, IFN-<U+03B3>R2, IL-12p40,
IL-12R-ß1, STAT-1, NEMO, IKBA and the recently discovered CYBB responsible for
autophagocytic vacuole and proteolysis, and interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8)
for dendritic cell immunodeficiency, have been identified in around 60% of
patients with the MSMD phenotype. Among all of the patients with PIDs referred
for investigation since 1985, we have identified four cases with the specific
defect (IFNRG1 for three and IL12RB for one), presenting as both BCG-induced
diseases and NTM infections, in addition to some patients with SCID, HIGM, CGD
and HIES. Furthermore, manifestations in patients with autoantibodies to IFN-<U+03B3>
(autoAbs-IFN-<U+03B3>), which is categorized as an anticytokine autoantibody syndrome,
can resemble the relatively persistent MSMD phenotype lacking BCG-induced
diseases.

IRF-8 extinguishes neutrophil production and promotes dendritic cell lineage
commitment in both myeloid and lymphoid mouse progenitors.

Becker AM(1), Michael DG, Satpathy AT, Sciammas R, Singh H, Bhattacharya D.

(1)Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of
Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.

While most blood lineages are assumed to mature through a single cellular and
developmental route downstream of HSCs, dendritic cells (DCs) can be derived from
both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors in vivo. To determine how distinct
progenitors can generate similar downstream lineages, we examined the
transcriptional changes that accompany loss of in vivo myeloid potential as
common myeloid progenitors differentiate into common DC progenitors (CDPs), and
as lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) differentiate into all
lymphoid progenitors (ALPs). Microarray studies revealed that IFN regulatory
factor 8 (IRF-8) expression increased during each of these transitions.
Competitive reconstitutions using Irf8(-/-) BM demonstrated cell-intrinsic
defects in the formation of CDPs and all splenic DC subsets. Irf8(-/-) common
myeloid progenitors and, unexpectedly, Irf8(-/-) ALPs produced more neutrophils
in vivo than their wild-type counterparts at the expense of DCs. Retroviral
expression of IRF-8 in multiple progenitors led to reduced neutrophil production 
and increased numbers of DCs, even in the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor
(GMP), which does not normally possess conventional DC potential. These data
suggest that IRF-8 represses a neutrophil module of development and promotes
convergent DC development from multiple lymphoid and myeloid progenitors
autonomously of cellular context.

Dissecting the genetics of complex inheritance: linkage disequilibrium mapping
provides insight into Crohn disease.

Author information: 
(1)Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University
College London, London, UK.

Family studies for Crohn disease (CD) report extensive linkage on chromosome 16q 
and pinpoint NOD2 as a possible causative locus. However, linkage is also
observed in families that do not bear the most frequent NOD2 causative mutations,
but no other signals on 16q have been found so far in published genome-wide
association studies. Our aim is to identify this missing genetic contribution. We
apply a powerful genetic mapping approach to the Wellcome Trust Case-Control
Consortium and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases genome-wide association data on CD. This method takes into account the
underlying structure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) by using genetic distances
from LD maps and provides a location for the causal agent. We find genetic
heterogeneity within the NOD2 locus and also show an independent and unsuspected 
involvement of the neighboring gene, CYLD. We find associations with the IRF8
region and the region containing CDH1 and CDH3, as well as substantial phenotypic
and genetic heterogeneity for CD itself. The genes are known to be involved in
inflammation and immune dysregulation. These findings provide insight into the
genetics of CD and suggest promising directions for understanding disease
heterogeneity. The application of this method thus paves the way for
understanding complex inheritance in general, leading to the dissection of
different pathways and ultimately, personalized treatment.

Steady-state hematopoiesis is altered on infection, but the cellular and
molecular mechanisms driving these changes are largely unknown. Modulation of
hematopoiesis is essential to increase the output of the appropriate type of
effector cell required to combat the invading pathogen. In the present study, we 
demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN<U+03B3> is involved in orchestrating 
inflammation-induced myelopoiesis. Using both mouse models and in vitro assays,
we show that IFN<U+03B3> induces the differentiation of monocytes over neutrophils at
the level of myeloid progenitors. Infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus induces monopoiesis in wild-type mice, but causes increased neutrophil
production in IFN<U+03B3>(-/-) mice. We demonstrate that IFN<U+03B3> enhances the expression of
the monopoiesis-inducing transcription factors IRF8 and PU.1 in myeloid
progenitor cells, whereas it reduces G-CSF-driven neutrophil differentiation via 
a SOCS3-dependent inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. These results establish a 
critical role for IFN<U+03B3> in directing monocyte versus neutrophil development during
immune activation.

IRF8 governs expression of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity in
human and mouse germinal center B cells.

IRF8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8) is a transcription factor expressed
throughout B cell differentiation except for mature plasma cells. Previous
studies showed it is part of the transcriptional network governing B cell
specification and commitment in the bone marrow, regulates the distribution of
mature B cells into the splenic follicular and marginal zone compartments, and is
expressed at highest levels in germinal center (GC) B cells. Here, we
investigated the transcriptional programs and signaling pathways affected by IRF8
in human and mouse GC B cells as defined by ChIP-chip analyses and
transcriptional profiling. We show that IRF8 binds a large number of genes by
targeting two distinct motifs, half of which are also targeted by PU.1. Over 70% 
of the binding sites localized to proximal and distal promoter regions with ~25% 
being intragenic. There was significant enrichment among targeted genes for those
involved in innate and adaptive immunity with over 30% previously defined as
interferon stimulated genes. We also showed that IRF8 target genes contributes to
multiple aspects of the biology of mature B cells including critical components
of the molecular crosstalk among GC B cells, T follicular helper cells, and
follicular dendritic cells.

Inflammation plays a key role in excessive bone loss in conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. An important paradigm in immunology is
that inflammatory factors activate feedback inhibition mechanisms to restrain
inflammation and limit associated tissue damage. We hypothesized that
inflammatory factors would activate similar feedback mechanisms to restrain bone 
loss in inflammatory settings. We have identified three mechanisms that inhibit
osteoclastogenesis and are induced by inflammatory factors such as toll-like
receptor ligands and cytokines; downregulation of expression of costimulatory
molecules such as TREM-2; induction of shedding, and thereby inactivation of the 
M-CSF receptor c-Fms, leading to decreased RANK transcription; and induction of
transcriptional repressors such as interferon regulatory factor 8. It is likely
that these mechanisms work in a complementary and cooperative manner to fine tune
the extent of osteoclastogenesis in inflammatory settings, and their augmentation
may represent an alternative therapeutic approach to suppress bone resorption.

Dendritic cells (DCs) subsets differ in precursor cell of origin, functional
properties, requirements for growth factors, and dependence on transcription
factors. Lymphoid-tissue resident CD8a(+) conventional DCs (cDCs) and
CD11b(low/-)CD103(+) non-lymphoid DCs are developmentally related, each being
dependent on FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), and requiring the
transcription factors Batf3, Irf8, and Id2 for development. It was recently
suggested that granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was
required for the development of dermal CD11b(low/-)Langerin(+)CD103(+) DCs, and
that this dermal DC subset was required for priming autoreactive T cells in
experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Here, we compared development of
peripheral tissue DCs and susceptibility to EAE in GM-CSF receptor deficient
(Csf2rb(-/-)) and Batf3(-/-) mice. We find that Batf3-dependent dermal
CD11b(low/-)Langerin(+) DCs do develop in Csf2rb(-/-) mice, but that they express
reduced, but not absent, levels of CD103. Further, Batf3(-/-) mice lacking all
peripheral CD11b(low/-) DCs show robust Th cell priming after subcutaneous
immunization and are susceptible to EAE. Our results suggest that defective T
effector priming and resistance to EAE exhibited by Csf2rb(-/-) mice does not
result from the absence of dermal CD11b(low/-)Langerin(+)CD103(+) DCs.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex trait characterised by the
production of a range of auto-antibodies and a diverse set of clinical
phenotypes. Currently, ~8% of the genetic contribution to SLE in Europeans is
known, following publication of several moderate-sized genome-wide (GW)
association studies, which identified loci with a strong effect (OR>1.3). In
order to identify additional genes contributing to SLE susceptibility, we
conducted a replication study in a UK dataset (870 cases, 5,551 controls) of 23
variants that showed moderate-risk for lupus in previous studies. Association
analysis in the UK dataset and subsequent meta-analysis with the published data
identified five SLE susceptibility genes reaching genome-wide levels of
significance (P(comb)<5×10(-8)): NCF2 (P(comb) = 2.87×10(-11)), IKZF1 (P(comb) = 
2.33×10(-9)), IRF8 (P(comb) = 1.24×10(-8)), IFIH1 (P(comb) = 1.63×10(-8)), and
TYK2 (P(comb) = 3.88×10(-8)). Each of the five new loci identified here can be
mapped into interferon signalling pathways, which are known to play a key role in
the pathogenesis of SLE. These results increase the number of established
susceptibility genes for lupus to ~30 and validate the importance of using large 
datasets to confirm associations of loci which moderately increase the risk for
disease.

Osteoclasts together with osteoblasts play pivotal roles in bone remodeling.
Aberrations in osteoclast differentiation and activity contribute to osteopenic
disease. Osteoclasts differentiate from monocyte/macrophage progenitors, a
process that is initiated by the interaction between receptor activator of NF-<U+03BA>B 
(RANK) and its ligand, RANKL. In this study, we identified
7-oxo-7-deacetoxygedunin (7-OG), a gedunin type limonoid from seeds of the
mangrove Xylocarpus moluccensis, as a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis.
Additionally, 7-OG showed strong anti-osteoclastogenic activity with low
cytotoxicity against the monocyte/macrophage progenitor cell line, RAW264.7. The 
IC50 for anti-osteoclastogenic activity was 4.14µM. Treatment with 7-OG
completely abolished the appearance of multinucleated giant cells with
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with
RANKL. When the expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis was
investigated, a complete downregulation of NFATc1 and cathepsin K and a delayed
downregulation of irf8 were observed upon 7-OG treatment in the presence of
RANKL. Furthermore, treatment with this limonoid suppressed RANKL-induced
activation of p38, MAPK and Erk and nuclear localization of NF-<U+03BA>B p65. Taken
together, we present evidence indicating a plant limonoid as a novel
osteoclastogenic inhibitor that could be used for osteoporosis and related
conditions.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 8 and IRF4 are structurally-related,
hematopoietic cell-specific transcription factors that cooperatively regulate the
differentiation of dendritic cells and B cells. Whilst in myeloid cells IRF8 is
known to modulate growth and differentiation, the role of IRF4 is poorly
understood. In this study, we show that IRF4 has activities similar to IRF8 in
regulating myeloid cell development. The ectopic expression of IRF4 in myeloid
progenitor cells in vitro inhibits cell growth, promotes macrophages, but hinders
granulocytic cell differentiation. We also show that IRF4 binds to and activates 
transcription through the IRF-Ets composite sequence (IECS). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that Irf8<U+207B>/<U+207B>Irf4<U+207B>/<U+207B> mice exhibit a more severe chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML)-like disease than Irf8<U+207B>/<U+207B> mice, involving a disproportionate
expansion of granulocytes at the expense of monocytes/macrophages. Irf4<U+207B>/<U+207B> mice, 
however, display no obvious abnormality in myeloid cell development, presumably
because IRF4 is expressed at a much lower level than IRF8 in
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Our results also suggest that IRF8 and IRF4
have not only common but also specific activities in myeloid cells. Since the
expression of both the IRF8 and IRF4 genes is downregulated in CML patients,
these results may add to our understanding of CML pathogenesis.

A prominent phenotype of IRF8 knockout (KO) mice is the uncontrolled expansion of
immature myeloid cells. The molecular mechanism underlying this
myeloproliferative syndrome is still elusive. In this study, we observed that Bax
expression level is low in bone marrow preginitor cells and increases
dramatically in primary myeloid cells in wt mice. In contrast, Bax expression
level remained at a low level in primarymyeloid cells in IRF8 KO mice. However,
in vitro IRF8 KO bone marrow-differentiated myeloid cells expressed Bax at a
level as high as that in wild type myeloid cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that IRF8 specifically binds to the Bax promoter region in primary myeloid cells.
Functional analysis indicated that IRF8 deficiency results in increased
resistance of the primary myeloid cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our findings
show that IRF8 directly regulates Bax transcription in vivo, but not in vitro
during myeloid cell lineage differentiation.

Hereditary homozygous C1q deficiency is rare, but it almost certainly causes
systemic lupus erythematosus. On the other hand, C1q levels can decline in
systemic lupus erythematosus patients without apparent C1q gene defects and the
versatility in C1q production is a likely cause. As an 18-subunit protein, C1q is
assembled in a 1:1:1 ratio from three different subunits. The three human C1q
genes are closely bundled on chromosome 1 (C1qA-C1qC-C1qB) and their basal and
IFN<U+03B3>-stimulated expression, largely restricted to macrophages and dendritic
cells, is apparently synchronized. We cloned the three gene promoters and
observed that although the C1qB promoter exhibited basal and IFN<U+03B3>-stimulated
activities consistent with the endogenous C1qB gene, the activities of the cloned
C1qA and C1qC promoters were suppressed by IFN<U+03B3>. To certain extents, these were
corrected when the C1qB promoter was cloned at the 3' end across the luciferase
reporter gene. A 53-bp element is essential to the activities of the C1qB
promoter and the transcription factors PU.1 and IRF8 bound to this region. By
chromatin immunoprecipitation, the C1qB promoter was co-precipitated with PU.1
and IRF8. shRNA knockdown of PU.1 and IRF8 diminished C1qB promoter response to
IFN<U+03B3>. STAT1 instead regulated C1qB promoter through IRF8 induction. Collectively,
our results reveal a novel transcriptional mechanism by which the expression of
the three C1q genes is synchronized.

Interferons (IFNs) are proteins involved in many functions including antiviral
and antimicrobial response, apoptosis, cell cycle control and mediating other
cytokines. IFN gamma (IFNG) is a proinflammatory cytokine that modulates many
immune-related genes. In this study we examine genetic variation in IFNG, IFNGR1,
IFNGR2 and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) to determine associations with
colon and rectal cancer and survival after diagnosis. We include data from two
population-based incident studies of colon cancer (1555 cases and 1956 controls) 
and rectal cancer (754 cases and 959 controls). Five tagSNPs in IFNG, IRF2 and
IRF3 were associated with colon cancer and eight tagSNPs in IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IRF2,
IRF4, IRF6 and IRF8 were associated with rectal cancer. IRF3 rs2304204 was
associated with the strongest direct association and IRF2 3775554 with the
strongest inverse association for colon cancer [odds ratios (ORs) 1.43, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.82 for recessive model and 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.97
for unrestricted model]. For rectal cancer, IFNGR1 rs3799488 was directly
associated with risk (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.04-5.09 for recessive model), whereas
IRF6 rs861020 was inversely associated with risk (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.95).
Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms interacted significant with both NF-<U+03BA>B1
and IL6 and with aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cigarette
smoking. Using a summary score to estimate mutational load, we observed a hazard 
rate ratio (HRR) close to 5.00 (95% CI 2.73-8.99) for both colon and rectal (HRR 
4.83, 95% CI 2.34-10.05) cancer for those in the category having the most at-risk
genotypes. These data suggest the importance of IFN-signaling pathway on colon
and rectal cancer risk and survival after diagnosis.

Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a critical transcriptional regulator in 
B cell development and function. We have previously shown that IRF4, together
with IRF8, orchestrates pre-B cell development by limiting pre-B cell expansion
and by promoting pre-B cell differentiation. Here, we report that IRF4 suppresses
c-Myc induced leukemia in EµMyc mice. Our results show that c-Myc induced
leukemia was greatly accelerated in the IRF4 heterozygous mice (IRF4(+/-)Myc);
the average age of mortality in the IRF4(+/-)Myc mice was only 7 to 8 weeks but
was 20 weeks in the control mice. Our results show that IRF4(+/-)Myc leukemic
cells were derived from large pre-B cells and were hyperproliferative and
resistant to apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that the majority of
IRF4(+/-)Myc leukemic cells inactivated the wild-type IRF4 allele and contained
defects in Arf-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. p27(kip) is part of the molecular
circuitry that controls pre-B cell expansion. Our results show that expression of
p27(kip) was lost in the IRF4(+/-)Myc leukemic cells and reconstitution of IRF4
expression in those cells induced p27(kip) and inhibited their expansion. Thus,
IRF4 functions as a classical tumor suppressor to inhibit c-Myc induced B cell
leukemia in EµMyc mice.

The aim of this study was to determine, through a genome-wide association study
(GWAS), the genetic components contributing to different clinical sub-phenotypes 
of systemic sclerosis (SSc). We considered limited (lcSSc) and diffuse (dcSSc)
cutaneous involvement, and the relationships with presence of the SSc-specific
auto-antibodies, anti-centromere (ACA), and anti-topoisomerase I (ATA). Four GWAS
cohorts, comprising 2,296 SSc patients and 5,171 healthy controls, were
meta-analyzed looking for associations in the selected subgroups. Eighteen
polymorphisms were further tested in nine independent cohorts comprising an
additional 3,175 SSc patients and 4,971 controls. Conditional analysis for
associated SNPs in the HLA region was performed to explore their independent
association in antibody subgroups. Overall analysis showed that non-HLA
polymorphism rs11642873 in IRF8 gene to be associated at GWAS level with lcSSc
(P<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.32×10(-12), OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.75). Also, rs12540874 in GRB10 gene (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.27 × 10(-6),
OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.15) and rs11047102 in SOX5 gene (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.39×10(-7), OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.36) showed a
suggestive association with lcSSc and ACA subgroups respectively. In the HLA
region, we observed highly associated allelic combinations in the HLA-DQB1 locus 
with ACA (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.79×10(-61), OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.48), in the HLA-DPA1/B1 loci with ATA
(P<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.57×10(-76), OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>8.84), and in NOTCH4 with ACA P<U+200A>=<U+200A>8.84×10(-21),
OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.55) and ATA (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.14×10(-8), OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.54). We have identified three new
non-HLA genes (IRF8, GRB10, and SOX5) associated with SSc clinical and
auto-antibody subgroups. Within the HLA region, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1/B1, and NOTCH4
associations with SSc are likely confined to specific auto-antibodies. These data
emphasize the differential genetic components of subphenotypes of SSc.

factor 8.

RATIONALE: Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) inhibits the progression of
atherosclerosis and promotes regression of existing lesions. In addition, LXRa
levels are high in regressive plaques. Macrophage arginase 1 (Arg1) expression is
inversely correlated with atherosclerosis progression and is markedly decreased
in foam cells within the lesion.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate LXRa regulation of Arg1 expression in cultured
macrophages and atherosclerotic regressive lesions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that Arg1 expression is enhanced in CD68+ cells
from regressive versus progressive lesions in a murine aortic arch transplant
model. In cultured macrophages, ligand-activated LXRa markedly enhances basal and
interleukin-4-induced Arg1 mRNA and protein expression as well as promoter
activity. This LXRa-enhanced Arg1 expression correlates with a reduction in
nitric oxide levels. Moreover, Arg1 expression within regressive atherosclerotic 
plaques is LXRa-dependent, as enhanced expression of Arg1 in regressive lesions
is impaired in LXRa-deficient CD68+ cells. LXRa does not bind to the Arg1
promoter but instead promotes the interaction between PU.1 and interferon
regulatory factor (IRF)8 transcription factors and induces their binding of a
novel composite element. Accordingly, knockdown of either IRF8 or PU.1 strongly
impairs LXRa regulation of Arg1 expression in macrophage cells. Finally, we
demonstrate that LXRa binds the IRF8 locus and its activation increases IRF8 mRNA
and protein levels in these cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This work implicates Arg1 in atherosclerosis regression and
identifies LXRa as a novel regulator of Arg1 and IRF8 in macrophages.
Furthermore, it provides a unique molecular mechanism by which LXRa regulates
macrophage target gene expression through PU.1 and IRF8.

myeloid cells and during tuberculosis.

IRF8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8) plays an important role in defenses against
intracellular pathogens, including several aspects of myeloid cells function. It 
is required for ontogeny and maturation of macrophages and dendritic cells, for
activation of anti-microbial defenses, and for production of the Th1-polarizing
cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) in response to interferon gamma (IFN<U+03B3>) and
protection against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The transcriptional
programs and cellular pathways that are regulated by IRF8 in response to IFN<U+03B3> and
that are important for defenses against M. tuberculosis are poorly understood.
These were investigated by transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation
on microarrays (ChIP-chip). Studies in primary macrophages identified 368 genes
that are regulated by IRF8 in response to IFN<U+03B3>/CpG and that behave as stably
segregating expression signatures (eQTLs) in F2 mice fixed for a wild-type or
mutant allele at IRF8. A total of 319 IRF8 binding sites were identified on
promoters genome-wide (ChIP-chip) in macrophages treated with IFN<U+03B3>/CpG, defining 
a functional G/AGAAnTGAAA motif. An analysis of the genes bearing a functional
IRF8 binding site, and showing regulation by IFN<U+03B3>/CpG in macrophages and/or in M.
tuberculosis-infected lungs, revealed a striking enrichment for the pathways of
antigen processing and presentation, including multiple structural and enzymatic 
components of the Class I and Class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex)
antigen presentation machinery. Also significantly enriched as IRF8 targets are
the group of endomembrane- and phagosome-associated small GTPases of the IRG
(immunity-related GTPases) and GBP (guanylate binding proteins) families. These
results identify IRF8 as a key regulator of early response pathways in myeloid
cells, including phagosome maturation, antigen processing, and antigen
presentation by myeloid cells.

Dendritic cells (DCs) contribute to islet inflammation and its progression to
diabetes in NOD mouse model and human. DCs play a crucial role in the
presentation of autoantigen and activation of diabetogenic T cells, and IRF4 and 
IRF8 are crucial genes involved in the development of DCs. We have therefore
investigated the expression of these genes in splenic DCs during diabetes
progression in NOD mice. We found that IRF4 expression was upregulated in
splenocytes and in splenic CD11c(+) DCs of NOD mice as compared to BALB/c mice.
In contrast, IRF8 gene expression was higher in splenocytes of NOD mice whereas
its expression was similar in splenic CD11c(+) DCs of NOD and BALB/c mice.
Importantly, levels of IRF4 and IRF8 expression were lower in tolerogenic bone
marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) generated with GM-CSF as compared to immunogenic BMDCs
generated with GM-CSF and IL-4. Analysis of splenic DCs subsets indicated that
high expression of IRF4 was associated with increased levels of
CD4(+)CD8a(-)IRF4(+)CD11c(+) DCs but not CD4(-)CD8a(+)IRF8(+)CD11c(+) DCs in NOD 
mice. Our results showed that IRF4 expression was up-regulated in NOD mice and
correlated with the increased levels of CD4(+)CD8a(-) DCs, suggesting that IRF4
may be involved in abnormal DC functions in type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the
incidence is particularly high in southwestern Taiwan. Previous studies have
identified several tumor-related genes that are hypermethylated in bladder
cancer; however the DNA methylation profile of bladder cancer in Taiwan is not
fully understood.
METHODS: In this study, we compared the DNA methylation profile of multiple tumor
suppressor genes (APC, DAPK, E-cadherin, hMLH1, IRF8, p14, p15, RASSF1A, SFRP1
and SOCS-1) in bladder cancer patients from different Chinese sub-populations
including Taiwan (104 cases), Hong Kong (82 cases) and China (24 cases) by MSP.
Two normal human urothelium were also included as control. To investigate the
diagnostic potential of using DNA methylation in non-invasive detection of
bladder cancer, degree of methylation of DAPK, IRF8, p14, RASSF1A and SFRP1 was
also accessed by quantitative MSP in urine samples from thirty bladder cancer
patients and nineteen non-cancer controls.
RESULTS: There were distinct DNA methylation epigenotypes among the different
sub-populations. Further, samples from Taiwan and China demonstrated a bimodal
distribution suggesting that CpG island methylator phentotype (CIMP) is presented
in bladder cancer. Moreover, the number of methylated genes in samples from
Taiwan and Hong Kong were significantly correlated with histological grade (P <
0.01) and pathological stage (P < 0.01). Regarding the samples from Taiwan,
methylation of SFRP1, IRF8, APC and RASSF1A were significantly associated with
increased tumor grade, stage. Methylation of RASSF1A was associated with tumor
recurrence. Patients with methylation of APC or RASSF1A were also significantly
associated with shorter recurrence-free survival. For methylation detection in
voided urine samples of cancer patients, the sensitivity and specificity of using
any of the methylated genes (IRF8, p14 or sFRP1) by qMSP was 86.7% and 94.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that there are distinct methylation
epigenotypes among different Chinese sub-populations. These profiles demonstrate 
gradual increases with cancer progression. Finally, detection of gene methylation
in voided urine with these distinct DNA methylation markers is more sensitive
than urine cytology.

T(H)17 cells are recognized as a unique subset of T helper cells that have
critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and tissue inflammation.
Although ROR<U+03B3>t is necessary for the generation of T(H)17 cells, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of T(H)17 cells are not fully
understood. Here we show that a member of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)
family of transcription factors, IRF8, has a critical role in silencing
T(H)17-cell differentiation. Mice with a conventional knockout, as well as a T
cell-specific deletion, of the Irf8 gene exhibited more efficient T(H)17 cells.
Indeed, studies of an experimental model of colitis showed that IRF8 deficiency
resulted in more severe inflammation with an enhanced T(H)17 phenotype. IRF8 was 
induced steadily and inhibited T(H)17-cell differentiation during T(H)17 lineage 
commitment at least in part through its physical interaction with ROR<U+03B3>t. These
findings define IRF8 as a novel intrinsic transcriptional inhibitor of
T(H)17-cell differentiation.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe multisystem autoimmune disease
that results from both genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Many
lines of investigation support interferon alpha (IFN-a) as a causal agent in
human lupus, and high levels of serum IFN-a are a heritable risk factor for SLE. 
Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors
involved in host defense, which can induce transcription of IFN-a and other
immune response genes after activation. In SLE, circulating immune complexes that
contain nucleic acid are prevalent. These complexes are recognized by endosomal
Toll-like receptors, resulting in activation of downstream IRF proteins. Genetic 
variants in the IRF5 and IRF7 genes have been associated with SLE susceptibility,
and these same variants are associated with increased serum IFN-a in SLE
patients. The increase in serum IFN-a related to IRF5 and 7 genotypes is observed
only in patients with particular antibody specificities. This suggests that
chronic stimulation of the endosomal Toll-like receptors by autoantibody immune
complexes is required for IRF SLE-risk variants to cause elevation of circulating
IFN-a and subsequent risk of SLE. Recently, genetic variation in the IRF8 gene
has been associated with SLE and multiple sclerosis, and studies support an
impact of IRF8 genotype on the IFN-a pathway. In summary, the SLE-associated
polymorphisms in the IRF family of proteins seem to be gain-of-function variants,
and understanding the impact of these variants on the IFN-a pathway in vivo may
guide therapeutic strategies directed at the Toll-like receptor/IRF/IFN-a pathway
in SLE.

BACKGROUND: In the recently published meta-analysis of multiple sclerosis
genome-wide association studies De Jager et al. identified three single
nucleotide polymorphisms associated to MS: rs17824933 (CD6), rs1800693 (TNFRSF1A)
and rs17445836 (61.5 kb from IRF8). To refine our understanding of these
associations we sought to replicate these findings in a large more extensive
independent sample set of 11 populations of European origin.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We calculated individual and combined associations using a
meta-analysis method by Kazeem and Farral (2005). We confirmed the association of
rs1800693 in TNFRSF1A (p 4.19 × 10-7, OR 1.12, 7,665 cases, 8,051 controls) and
rs17445836 near IRF8 (p 5.35 × 10-10, OR 0.84, 6,895 cases, 7,580 controls and
596 case-parent trios) The SNP rs17824933 in CD6 also showed nominally
significant evidence for association (p 2.19 × 10-5, OR 1.11, 8,047 cases, 9,174 
controls, 604 case-parent trios).
CONCLUSIONS: Variants in TNFRSF1A and in the vicinity of IRF8 were confirmed to
be associated in these independent cohorts, which supports the role of these loci
in etiology of multiple sclerosis. The variant in CD6 reached genome-wide
significance after combining the data with the original meta-analysis. Fine
mapping is required to identify the predisposing variants in the loci and future 
functional studies will refine their molecular role in MS pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The genetic analysis of human primary immunodeficiencies has defined 
the contribution of specific cell populations and molecular pathways in the host 
defense against infection. Disseminated infection caused by bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines is an early manifestation of primary
immunodeficiencies, such as severe combined immunodeficiency. In many affected
persons, the cause of disseminated BCG disease is unexplained.
METHODS: We evaluated an infant presenting with features of severe
immunodeficiency, including early-onset disseminated BCG disease, who required
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We also studied two otherwise healthy
subjects with a history of disseminated but curable BCG disease in childhood. We 
characterized the monocyte and dendritic-cell compartments in these three
subjects and sequenced candidate genes in which mutations could plausibly confer 
susceptibility to BCG disease.
RESULTS: We detected two distinct disease-causing mutations affecting interferon 
regulatory factor 8 (IRF8). Both K108E and T80A mutations impair IRF8
transcriptional activity by disrupting the interaction between IRF8 and DNA. The 
K108E variant was associated with an autosomal recessive severe immunodeficiency 
with a complete lack of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. The T80A
variant was associated with an autosomal dominant, milder immunodeficiency and a 
selective depletion of CD11c+CD1c+ circulating dendritic cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a class of human primary immunodeficiencies
that affect the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. They also show that
human IRF8 is critical for the development of monocytes and dendritic cells and
for antimycobacterial immunity. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and

myelogeneous leukemia.

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a key transcription factor for myeloid cell
differentiation and its expression is frequently lost in hematopoietic cells of
human myeloid leukemia patients. IRF8-deficient mice exhibit uncontrolled clonal 
expansion of undifferentiated myeloid cells that can progress to a fatal blast
crisis, thereby resembling human chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML). Therefore, 
IRF8 is a myeloid leukemia suppressor. Whereas the understanding of IRF8 function
in CML has recently improved, the molecular mechanisms underlying IRF8 function
in CML are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified acid ceramidase
(A-CDase) as a general transcription target of IRF8. We demonstrated that IRF8
expression is regulated by IRF8 promoter DNA methylation in myeloid leukemia
cells. Restoration of IRF8 expression repressed A-CDase expression, resulting in 
C16 ceramide accumulation and increased sensitivity of CML cells to FasL-induced 
apoptosis. In myeloid cells derived from IRF8-deficient mice, A-CDase protein
level was dramatically increased. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IRF8 directly
binds to the A-CDase promoter. At the functional level, inhibition of A-CDase
activity, silencing A-CDase expression, or application of exogenous C16 ceramide 
sensitized CML cells to FasL-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of A-CDase
decreased CML cells' sensitivity to FasL-induced apoptosis. Consequently,
restoration of IRF8 expression suppressed CML development in vivo at least
partially through a Fas-dependent mechanism. In summary, our findings determine
the mechanism of IRF8 downregulation in CML cells and they determine a primary
pathway of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis and disease progression.

Association of a functional polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of SPI1
with systemic lupus erythematosus.

OBJECTIVE: SPI1, also referred to as PU.1, is an Ets family transcription factor 
that interacts with IRF2, IRF4, and IRF8. In view of the significance of the type
I interferon pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), this study was
undertaken to investigate a possible association between SPI1 polymorphisms and
SLE.
METHODS: A case-control association study was performed using 6 tag
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as a SNP located upstream of SPI1
previously found to be associated with acute myelogenous leukemia, in 400
Japanese patients with SLE and 450 healthy controls. Resequencing of all exons
and known regulatory regions was performed to identify functional polymorphisms. 
Association of genotype and SPI1 expression was examined using the GENEVAR
database and reporter assays.
RESULTS: A significant association was detected in 2 SNPs in intron 2 (rs10769258
and rs4752829) (P = 0.005 and P = 0.008, respectively, under the dominant model).
The association was stronger in patients with nephropathy. Resequencing
identified a potentially functional polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region
(3'-UTR), rs1057233, which was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs in 
intron 2. The number of risk alleles at rs1057233 was strongly correlated with
SPI1 messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the database analysis (P = 0.0002), and was
confirmed by a reporter assay. Interestingly, rs1057233 alters a target sequence 
for microRNA hsa-miR-569 (miR-569). Transfection experiments demonstrated that
miR-569 inhibits expression of a reporter construct with the 3'-UTR sequence
containing the nonrisk allele but not the risk allele.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a SNP in the 3'-UTR of SPI1 is associated 
with elevated SPI1 mRNA level and with susceptibility to SLE.

IRF4 regulates IL-17A promoter activity and controls ROR<U+03B3>t-dependent Th17 colitis
in vivo.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor IRF4 is involved in several T-cell-dependent
chronic inflammatory diseases. To elucidate the mechanisms for pathological
cytokine production in colitis, we addressed the role of the IRF transcription
factors in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental colitis.
METHODS: IRF levels and cytokine production in IBD patients were studied as well 
as the effects of IRF4 deficiency in experimental colitis.
RESULTS: In contrast to IRF1, IRF5, and IRF8, IRF4 expression in IBD was
augmented in the presence of active inflammation. Furthermore, IRF4 levels
significantly correlated with IL-6 and IL-17 mRNA expression and to a lesser
extent with IL-22 mRNA expression in IBD. To further explore the role of IRF4
under in vivo conditions, we studied IRF4-deficient and wildtype mice in
experimental colitis. In contrast to DSS colitis, IRF4 deficiency was protective 
in T-cell-dependent transfer colitis associated with reduced RORa/<U+03B3>t levels and
impaired IL-6, IL-17a, and IL-22 production, suggesting that IRF4 acts as a
master regulator of mucosal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent mechanistic
studies using database analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a novel IRF4 binding site in the
IL-17 gene promoter. Overexpression of IRF4 using retroviral infection induced
IL-17 production and IL-17 together with IL-6 induced ROR<U+03B3>t expression.
CONCLUSIONS: IRF4 can directly bind to the IL-17 promotor and induces mucosal
ROR<U+03B3>t levels and IL-17 gene expression thereby controlling Th17-dependent
colitis. Targeting of this molecular mechanism may lead to novel therapeutic
approaches in human IBD.

Cooperative contributions of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF8 to
interferon-<U+03B3>-mediated cytotoxic effects on oligodendroglial progenitor cells.

Medicine, Sacramento, California, USA.

BACKGROUND: Administration of exogenous interferon-<U+03B3> (IFN<U+03B3>) aggravates the
symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas interferon-ß (IFNß) is used for
treatment of MS patients. We previously demonstrated that IFN<U+03B3> induces apoptosis 
of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs), suggesting that IFN<U+03B3> is more toxic
to OPCs than IFNß. Thus we hypothesized that a difference in expression profiles 
between IFN<U+03B3>-inducible and IFNß-inducible genes in OPCs would predict the genes
responsible for IFN<U+03B3>-mediated cytotoxic effects on OPCs. We have tested this
hypothesis particularly focusing on the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)
well-known transcription factors up-regulated by IFNs.
METHODS: Highly pure primary rat OPC cultures were treated with IFN<U+03B3> and IFNß.
Cell death and proliferation were assessed by MTT reduction, caspase-3-like
proteinase activity, Annexin-V binding, mitochondrial membrane potential, and
BrdU-incorporation. Induction of all nine IRFs was comprehensively compared by
quantitative PCR between IFN<U+03B3>-treated and IFNß-treated OPCs. IRFs more strongly
induced by IFN<U+03B3> than by IFNß were selected, and tested for their ability to
induce OPC apoptosis by overexpression and by inhibition by dominant-negative
proteins or small interference RNA either in the presence or absence of IFN<U+03B3>.
RESULTS: Unlike IFN<U+03B3>, IFNß did not induce apoptosis of OPCs. Among nine IRFs,
IRF1 and IRF8 were preferentially up-regulated by IFN<U+03B3>. In contrast, IRF7 was
more robustly induced by IFNß than by IFN<U+03B3>. Overexpressed IRF1 elicited apoptosis
of OPCs, and a dominant negative IRF1 protein partially protected OPCs from
IFN<U+03B3>-induced apoptosis, indicating a substantial contribution of IRF1 to
IFN<U+03B3>-induced OPC apoptosis. On the other hand, overexpression of IRF8 itself had 
only marginal proapoptotic effects. However, overexpressed IRF8 enhanced the
IFN<U+03B3>-induced cytotoxicity and the proapoptotic effect of overexpressed IRF1, and 
down-regulation of IRF8 by siRNA partially but significantly reduced preapoptotic
cells after treatment with IFN<U+03B3>, suggesting that IRF8 cooperatively enhances
IFN<U+03B3>-induced OPC apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified that IRF1 and IRF8 mediate IFN<U+03B3>-signaling 
leading to OPC apoptosis. Therapies targeting at these transcription factors and 
their target genes could reduce IFN<U+03B3>-induced OPC loss and thereby enhance
remyelination in MS patients.

Robust and rapid induction of interferon-ß (IFN-ß) in monocytes after pathogenic 
stimulation is a hallmark of innate immune responses. Here, we reveal the
molecular mechanism underlying this key property that is exclusive to human blood
monocytes. We found that IFN-ß was produced rapidly in primary human monocytes as
a result of cooperation between the myeloid-specific transcription factor IRF8
and the ubiquitous transcription factor IRF3. Knockdown of IRF8 in monocytes
abrogated IFN-ß transcription, whereas reintroduction of IRF8 into the IRF8(-/-) 
32Dcl3 murine myeloid cell line reinstated IFN-ß transcription. Moreover, we
provide evidence that IRF8 constitutively binds to the ETS/IRF composite element 
of the IFN-ß promoter region together with PU.1 in vivo. Furthermore we uncovered
a requirement for IRF3, a master regulator of IFN-ß production, as a previously
un-indentified interaction partner of IRF8. We mapped the protein-protein
interacting regions of IRF3 and IRF8, and found that their interaction was
independent of the DNA-binding domain and the IRF association domain of IRF8 and 
IRF3, respectively. Therefore, we propose a model for the rapid induction of
IFN-ß in monocytes, whereby IRF8 and PU.1 form a scaffold complex on the IFN-ß
promoter to facilitate the recruitment of IRF3, thus enabling rapid IFN-ß
transcription.

Positive regulatory domain I (PRDM1) and IRF8/PU.1 counter-regulate MHC class II 
transactivator (CIITA) expression during dendritic cell maturation.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are key mediators of immune function through robust and
tightly regulated presentation of antigen in the context of the MHC Class II. MHC
Class II expression is controlled by the transactivator CIITA. CIITA expression
in conventional DCs is uniquely dependent on an uncharacterized myeloid
cell-specific promoter, CIITApI. We now identify in vivo the promoter structure
and factors regulating CIITApI. In immature DCs transcription requires binding of
PU.1, IRF8, NF<U+03BA>B, and Sp1 to the promoter. PU.1 binds independently at one site
and in a required heterodimer with IRF8 at a composite element. DCs from
IRF8-null mice have an unoccupied CIITApI promoter that can be rescued by
reconstitution with IRF8 in vitro. Furthermore, mutation of either PU.1 site or
the IFR8 site inhibits transcriptional activation. In vivo footprinting and
chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that DC maturation induces complete
disassociation of the bound activators paralleled by recruitment of PRDM1/Blimp-1
to the promoter. PRDM1 is a transcriptional repressor with essential roles in B
cells, T cells, NK cells, and DCs. We show that PRDM1 co-repressors, G9a and
HDAC2, are recruited to CIITApI, leading to a loss of histone acetylation and
acquisition of histone H3K9 dimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1<U+03B3> (HP1<U+03B3>). 
PRDM1 binding also blocks IRF8-mediated activation dependent on the PU.1/IRF
composite element. Together these findings reveal the mechanisms regulating CIITA
and, thus, antigen presentation in DCs, demonstrating that PRDM1 and IRF8/PU.1
counter-regulate expression. The activity of PRDM1 in silencing all three cell
type-specific CIITA promoters places it as a central regulator of antigen
presentation.

Transcriptional control of marginal zone (MZ) and follicular (FO) B cell
development remains incompletely understood. The transcription factor, IFN
regulatory factor (IRF)8, is known to play important roles in the differentiation
of early B cells. In this article, we demonstrate that IRF8 is also required for 
normal development of MZ and FO B cells. Mice with a conventional knockout of
Irf8 (IRF8(-/-)) or a point mutation in the IRF association domain of IRF8 had
increased numbers of MZ B cells. To determine the B cell-intrinsic effects of
IRF8 deficiency, we generated mice with a conditional allele of Irf8 crossed with
CD19-Cre mice (designated IRF8-conditional knockout [CKO]). These mice had
enlarged MZ and increased numbers of MZ and FO B cells compared with controls.
The FO B cells of CKO mice exhibited reduced expression of CD23 and moderately
increased expression of CD21. Gene-expression profiling showed that increased B
cell production in IRF8-CKO mice was associated with changes in expression of
genes involved in regulation of transcription, signaling, and inflammation.
Functional studies showed that IRF8-CKO mice generated normal Ab responses to
T-independent and T-dependent Ags. Thus, IRF8 controls the expansion and
maturation of MZ and FO B cells but has little effect on B cell function.

Prior genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified 10 susceptibility
loci for risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To identify additional loci,
we performed a GWA study in 407 CLL cases (of which 102 had a family history of
CLL) and 296 controls. Moreover, given the strong familial risk of CLL, we
further subset our GWA analysis to the CLL cases with a family history of CLL to 
identify loci specific to these familial CLL cases. Our top hits from these
analyses were evaluated in an additional sample of 252 familial CLL cases and 965
controls. Using all available data, we identified and confirmed an independent
association of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met genome-wide
statistical significance within the IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) gene
(combined P values = 3.37 × 10(-8)), located in the previously identified 16q24.1
locus. Subsetting to familial CLL cases, we identified and confirmed a new locus 
on chromosome 6p21.3 (combined P value = 6.92 × 10(-9)). This novel region
harbors the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB5 genes. Finally, we evaluated the 10 previously 
reported SNPs in the overall sample and replicated 8 of them. Our findings
support the hypothesis that familial CLL cases have additional genetic variants
not seen in sporadic CLL. Additional loci among familial CLL cases may be
identified through larger studies.

Using retrospectively collected outcome data for treatment naïve subjects treated
with either glatiramer acetate (GA) (n=332) or interferon beta (IFN ß) (n=424),
we replicated the lack of a significant difference in efficacy between these
treatments. Further, for both treatments, we observed a decline in the hazard of 
a relapse over time, which may suggest the existence of subsets of subjects with 
differential responses to each treatment. The HLA DRB1 1501 allele explained some
of this variation in event-free survival while on GA, and we found suggestive
evidence that an IRF8 polymorphism influences event-free survival in IFN ß
treated subjects.

Irf8 regulates macrophage versus neutrophil fate during zebrafish primitive
myelopoiesis.

In vertebrates, myeloid cells comprise polymorphonuclear and mononuclear lineages
that arise from 2 successive waves of development: a transitory primitive wave
giving rise to limited myeloid cells during embryonic stage and a definitive wave
capable of producing myeloid cells throughout the fetal and adult life. One key
unresolved question is what factors dictate polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear 
lineage fates during myelopoiesis. Here we show that during zebrafish
embryogenesis interferon regulatory factor-8 (irf8) is expressed specifically in 
macrophages but not neutrophils. Suppression of Irf8 function in zebrafish causes
a depletion of macrophages and an enhanced output of neutrophils but does not
affect the overall number, proliferation, and survival of primitive myeloid
cells. These data indicate that the skewed myeloid lineage development in Irf8
knockdown embryos results from a cell-fate switching. Such a conclusion is
further supported by the observation showing that overexpression of Irf8 promotes
macrophage formation at the expense of neutrophil development. Genetic epistasis 
analysis reveals that Irf8 acts downstream of Pu.1 but is insufficient to promote
macrophage development in the absence of Pu.1. Our findings demonstrate that Irf8
is a critical determinant for neutrophil versus macrophage fate choice during
zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis.

MicroRNAs are short ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that play an important role in many 
aspects of cellular biology such as differentiation and apoptosis, due to their
role in the regulation of gene expression. Using microRNA microarrays, we
characterized the microRNA gene expression of 27 patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) with normal cytogenetics, focusing on the microRNAs differentially
expressed between the M1 and M5 French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. An
accurate delineation of these two AML entities was observed based on the
expression of 12 microRNAs. We hypothesized that these microRNAs may potentially 
be involved in the differentiation block of M1 blasts and consequently monocytic 
differentiation. Using publically available mRNA data and microRNA target
prediction software, we identified several key myeloid factors that may be
targeted by our candidate microRNAs. The expression changes of the candidate
microRNAs during monocytic differentiation of AML cell lines treated with Vitamin
D and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were examined. All six candidate microRNAs 
were significantly down-regulated over the time course by quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction suggesting a link between these microRNAs
and monocytic differentiation. To further characterize these microRNAs, we
confirmed by luciferase assays that these microRNA target several key myeloid
factors such as MAFB, IRF8, and KLF4 identifying a possible mechanism for the
control of differentiation by these microRNAs.

Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly IC), a double-stranded RNA, is an effective
adjuvant in vivo. IFN-<U+03BB>s (also termed IL-28/29) are potent immunomodulatory and
antiviral cytokines. We demonstrate that poly IC injection in vivo induces large 
amounts of IFN-<U+03BB>, which depended on hematopoietic cells and the presence of TLR3 
(Toll-like receptor 3), IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor 3), IRF7, IFN-I receptor,
Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FL), and IRF8 but not on MyD88 (myeloid
differentiation factor 88), Rig-like helicases, or lymphocytes. Upon poly IC
injection in vivo, the IFN-<U+03BB> production by splenocytes segregated with cells
phenotypically resembling CD8a(+) conventional dendritic cells (DCs [cDCs]). In
vitro experiments revealed that CD8a(+) cDCs were the major producers of IFN-<U+03BB> in
response to poly IC, whereas both CD8a(+) cDCs and plasmacytoid DCs produced
large amounts of IFN-<U+03BB> in response to HSV-1 or parapoxvirus. The nature of the
stimulus and the cytokine milieu determined whether CD8a(+) cDCs produced IFN-<U+03BB>
or IL-12p70. Human DCs expressing BDCA3 (CD141), which is considered to be the
human counterpart of murine CD8a(+) DCs, also produced large amounts of IFN-<U+03BB>
upon poly IC stimulation. Thus, IFN-<U+03BB> production in response to poly IC is a
novel function of mouse CD8a(+) cDCs and their human equivalents.

Understanding the diversification of dendritic cell (DC) lineages is one of the
last frontiers in mapping the developmental hierarchy of the hematopoietic
system. DCs are a vital link between the innate and adaptive immune responses;
thus, elucidating their developmental pathways is crucial for insight into the
generation of natural immunity and for learning how to regulate DCs in clinical
settings. DCs arise from hematopoietic stem cells through specialized progenitor 
subsets under the direction of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and
Flt3L receptor (Flt3) signaling. Recent studies have revealed important
contributions from granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 
type I interferons (IFNs) in vivo. Furthermore, DC development is guided by
lineage-restricted transcription factors such as IRF8, E2-2, and Batf3. A
critical question centers on how cytokines and lineage-restricted transcription
factors operate molecularly to direct DC diversification. Here, we review recent 
findings that provide new insight into the DC developmental process.

Initially thought to play a restricted role in calcium homeostasis, the
pleiotropic actions of vitamin D in biology and their clinical significance are
only now becoming apparent. However, the mode of action of vitamin D, through its
cognate nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), and its contribution to diverse
disorders, remain poorly understood. We determined VDR binding throughout the
human genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel
DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). After calcitriol stimulation, we identified 2776
genomic positions occupied by the VDR and 229 genes with significant changes in
expression in response to vitamin D. VDR binding sites were significantly
enriched near autoimmune and cancer associated genes identified from genome-wide 
association (GWA) studies. Notable genes with VDR binding included IRF8,
associated with MS, and PTPN2 associated with Crohn's disease and T1D.
Furthermore, a number of single nucleotide polymorphism associations from GWA
were located directly within VDR binding intervals, for example, rs13385731
associated with SLE and rs947474 associated with T1D. We also observed
significant enrichment of VDR intervals within regions of positive selection
among individuals of Asian and European descent. ChIP-seq determination of
transcription factor binding, in combination with GWA data, provides a powerful
approach to further understanding the molecular bases of complex diseases.

Perturbation and time-course data sets, in combination with computational
approaches, can be used to infer transcriptional regulatory networks which
ultimately govern the developmental pathways and responses of cells. Here, we
individually knocked down the four transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, MYB and SP1 
in the human monocyte leukemia THP-1 cell line and profiled the genome-wide
transcriptional response of individual transcription starting sites using deep
sequencing based Cap Analysis of Gene Expression. From the proximal promoter
regions of the responding transcription starting sites, we derived de novo
binding-site motifs, characterized their biological function and constructed a
network. We found a previously described composite motif for PU.1 and IRF8 that
explains the overlapping set of transcriptional responses upon knockdown of
either factor.

The interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is an interferon
regulatory transcription factor, also referred to as IRF8. ICSBP acts as a
suppressor of myeloid leukemia, although few target genes explaining this effect 
have been identified. In the current studies, we identified the gene encoding
growth arrest specific 2 (GAS2) as an ICSBP target gene relevant to leukemia
suppression. We find that ICSBP, Tel, and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) bind to a
cis element in the GAS2 promoter and repress transcription in myeloid progenitor 
cells. Gas2 inhibits calpain protease activity, and beta-catenin is a calpain
substrate in these cells. Consistent with this, ICSBP decreases beta-catenin
protein and activity in a Gas2- and calpain-dependent manner. Conversely,
decreased ICSBP expression increases beta-catenin protein and activity by the
same mechanism. This is of interest, because decreased ICSBP expression and
increased beta-catenin activity are associated with poor prognosis and blast
crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We find that the expression of Bcr/abl 
(the CML oncoprotein) increases Gas2 expression in an ICSBP-dependent manner.
This results in decreased calpain activity and a consequent increase in
beta-catenin activity in Bcr/abl-positive (Bcr/abl(+)) cells. Therefore, these
studies have identified a Gas2/calpain-dependent mechanism by which ICSBP
influences beta-catenin activity in myeloid leukemia.

Interferon regulatory factor-8-driven myeloid differentiation is regulated by
12/15-lipoxygenase-mediated redox signaling.

OBJECTIVE: Several transcription factors determine the cell fate decision between
granulocytes and monocytes, but the upstream signal transduction pathways that
govern myelopoiesis are largely unknown. Based on our observation of aberrant
myeloid cell representation in hematopoietic tissues of 12/15-lipoxygenase
(12/15-LOX)-deficient (Alox15) mice, we tested the hypothesis that
polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism regulates myelopoiesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multicolor flow cytometric analysis and methylcellulose
assays were used to compare myelopoiesis and the differentiative capacity of
progenitors from Alox15 and wild-type mice. Furthermore, we elucidated the
mechanism by which 12/15-LOX is involved in regulation of myelopoiesis.
RESULTS: Granulopoiesis in Alox15 mice is increased while monopoiesis is reduced.
Moreover, there is an accumulation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors that
exhibit defective differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that
transcriptional activity of interferon regulatory factor-8 (Irf8), which
regulates myelopoiesis, is impaired in Alox15 progenitors and bone marrow-derived
macrophages due to loss of 12/15-LOX-mediated redox regulation of Irf8 nuclear
accumulation. Restoration of redox signaling in Alox15 bone marrow cells and
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors reversed the defect in myeloid
differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data establish 12/15-LOX-mediated redox signaling as a novel
regulator of myelopoiesis and Irf8.

Gene regulatory networks in living cells are controlled by the interaction of
multiple cell type-specific transcription regulators with DNA binding sites in
target genes. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon
consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), is a transcription factor expressed
predominantly in myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages. To find the functional
direct target genes of IRF8, the gene expression profiles of siRNA knockdown
samples and genome-wide binding locations by ChIP-chip were analyzed in THP-1
myelomonocytic leukemia cells. Consequently, 84 genes were identified as
functional direct targets. The ETS family transcription factor PU.1, also known
as SPI1, binds to IRF8 and regulates basal transcription in macrophages. Using
the same approach, we identified 53 direct target genes of PU.1; these overlapped
with 19 IRF8 targets. These 19 genes included key molecules of IFN signaling such
as OAS1 and IRF9, but excluded other IFN-related genes amongst the IRF8
functional direct target genes. We suggest that IRF8 and PU.1 can have both
combined, and independent actions on different promoters in myeloid cells.

Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors known to play key 
roles in innate and adaptive immune responses, cell growth, apoptosis, and
development. Their function in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer remains to be
determined, however. In the present study, therefore, we examined epigenetic
inactivation of IRF1-9 in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. We found that
expression of IRF4, IRF5, and IRF8 was frequently suppressed in gastric cancer
cell lines; that methylation of the three genes correlated with their silencing; 
and that treating the cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
(DAC) restored their expression. Expression of IRF5 in cancer cells was enhanced 
by the combination of DAC treatment and adenoviral vector-mediated expression of 
p53, p63, or p73. Interferon-gamma-induced expression of IRF8 was also enhanced
by DAC. Moreover, treating gastric cancer cells with DAC enhanced the suppressive
effects of interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma on cell
growth. Among a cohort of 455 gastric cancer and noncancerous gastric tissue
samples, methylation of IRF4 was frequently observed in both gastric cancer
specimens and noncancerous specimens of gastric mucosa from patients with
multiple gastric cancers, which suggests IRF4 methylation could be a useful
molecular marker for diagnosing recurrence of gastric cancers. Our findings
indicate that epigenetic IRF inactivation plays a key role in tumorigenesis of
gastric cancer, and that inhibition of DNA methylation may restore the antitumor 
activity of interferons through up-regulation of IRFs.

In mouse, a subset of dendritic cells (DCs) known as CD8alpha+ DCs has emerged as
an important player in the regulation of T cell responses and a promising target 
in vaccination strategies. However, translation into clinical protocols has been 
hampered by the failure to identify CD8alpha+ DCs in humans. Here, we
characterize a population of human DCs that expresses DNGR-1 (CLEC9A) and high
levels of BDCA3 and resembles mouse CD8alpha+ DCs in phenotype and function. We
describe the presence of such cells in the spleens of humans and humanized mice
and report on a protocol to generate them in vitro. Like mouse CD8alpha+ DCs,
human DNGR-1+ BDCA3hi DCs express Necl2, CD207, BATF3, IRF8, and TLR3, but not
CD11b, IRF4, TLR7, or (unlike CD8alpha+ DCs) TLR9. DNGR-1+ BDCA3hi DCs respond to
poly I:C and agonists of TLR8, but not of TLR7, and produce interleukin (IL)-12
when given innate and T cell-derived signals. Notably, DNGR-1+ BDCA3+ DCs from in
vitro cultures efficiently internalize material from dead cells and can
cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells upon treatment with poly I:C.
The characterization of human DNGR-1+ BDCA3hi DCs and the ability to grow them in
vitro opens the door for exploiting this subset in immunotherapy.

A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association screens coupled to a
replication exercise in a combined US/UK collection led to the identification of 
4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three gene loci, i.e. TNFRSF1A, CD6
and IRF8, as novel risk factors for multiple sclerosis with genome-wide level of 
significance. In the present study, using a combined all-Spain collection of 2515
MS patients and 2942 healthy controls, we demonstrate significant association of 
rs17824933 in CD6 (P(CMH)=0.004; OR=1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.24) and of rs1860545 in
TNFRSF1A (P(CMH)=0.001; OR=1.15; 95% CI 1.06-1.25) with MS, while the
low-frequency coding non-synonymous SNP rs4149584 in TNFRSF1A displayed a trend
for association (P(CMH)=0.062; OR=1.27; 95% CI 0.99-1.63). This data reinforce a 
generic role for CD6 and TNFRSF1A in susceptibility to MS, extending to
populations of southern European ancestry.

Although CD103-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) are widely present in nonlymphoid
tissues, the transcription factors controlling their development and their
relationship to other DC subsets remain unclear. Mice lacking the transcription
factor Batf3 have a defect in the development of CD8alpha+ conventional DCs
(cDCs) within lymphoid tissues. We demonstrate that Batf3(-/-) mice also lack
CD103+CD11b- DCs in the lung, intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), dermis,
and skin-draining lymph nodes. Notably, Batf3(-/-) mice displayed reduced priming
of CD8 T cells after pulmonary Sendai virus infection, with increased pulmonary
inflammation. In the MLNs and intestine, Batf3 deficiency resulted in the
specific lack of CD103+CD11b- DCs, with the population of CD103+CD11b+ DCs
remaining intact. Batf3(-/-) mice showed no evidence of spontaneous
gastrointestinal inflammation and had a normal contact hypersensitivity (CHS)
response, despite previous suggestions that CD103+ DCs were required for immune
homeostasis in the gut and CHS. The relationship between CD8alpha+ cDCs and
nonlymphoid CD103+ DCs implied by their shared dependence on Batf3 was further
supported by similar patterns of gene expression and their shared developmental
dependence on the transcription factor Irf8. These data provide evidence for a
developmental relationship between lymphoid organ-resident CD8alpha+ cDCs and
nonlymphoid CD103+ DCs.

Mammalian interferon regulatory factor (IRF)4 (PIP, LSIRF, and ICSAT) and IRF8
(ICSBP) are known to be critical in regulating a spectrum of functional and
developmental processes in lymphomyeloid cell lineages either through direct
binding to IRF-E motifs in target gene promoters or indirectly by binding to
composite motifs recognized by Ets family members, PU.I and Sp.I. Here we report,
for the first time in fish, the sequencing and characterization of full-length
cDNA homologues of rainbow trout (rt) IRF4 and rtIRF8. The rtIRF4 molecule
consists of 1848 bp with a 45 bp 5' UTR and a predicted 378 bp 3' UTR translating
into a 474 aa protein. RtIRF8 consists of 1951 bp with a 52 bp 5' UTR and a 564
bp 3' UTR translating into a 444 aa protein. Each gene possesses a putative DNA
binding domain (DBD) containing the tryptophan pentad-repeat domain found in all 
IRF family members. Both molecules also possess a well conserved IRF association 
domain (IAD). The presence of these domains along with phylogenetic analysis
places the two genes in the IRF4 subfamily. Both genes were detected in a range
of trout tissues where IRF8 was the overall predominant transcript. Consistent
with mammalian studies, the highest expression levels of IRF4 and IRF8 were
observed in the lymphomyeloid-rich fish tissues, spleen, head kidney and gills.
IRF8 expression in stimulated trout splenocytes was significantly up-regulated by
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), trout recombinant (r)IL-15, phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) treatment whilst
remaining refractory towards lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. IRF4 was
significantly down-regulated by LPS stimulation and remained refractory towards
poly I:C, trout rIL15, and PHA. PMA stimulation elicited a significant
upregulation of IRF4 expression. Overall, these data support the premise that
these IRFs are likely to play important roles in the functional and developmental
processes occurring in fish lymphomyeloid tissues.

Wilms' tumor gene 1 protein represses the expression of the tumor suppressor
interferon regulatory factor 8 in human hematopoietic progenitors and in leukemic
cells.

Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) is a transcription factor involved in developmental
processes. In adult hematopoiesis, only a small portion of early progenitor cells
express WT1, whereas most leukemias show persistently high levels, suggesting an 
oncogenic role. We have previously characterized oncogenic BCR/ABL1 tyrosine
kinase signaling pathways for increased WT1 expression. In this study, we show
that overexpression of BCR/ABL1 in CD34+ progenitor cells leads to reduced
expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), in addition to increased WT1
expression. Interestingly, IRF8 is known as a tumor suppressor in some leukemias 
and we investigated whether WT1 might repress IRF8 expression. When analyzed in
four leukemia mRNA expression data sets, WT1 and IRF8 were anticorrelated. Upon
overexpression in CD34+ progenitors, as well as in U937 cells, WT1 strongly
downregulated IRF8 expression. All four major WT1 splice variants induced
repression, but not the zinc-finger-deleted WT1 mutant, indicating dependence on 
DNA binding. A reporter construct with the IRF8 promoter was repressed by WT1,
dependent on a putative WT1-response element. Binding of WT1 to the IRF8 promoter
was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Our results identify IRF8 as a
direct target gene for WT1 and provide a possible mechanism for oncogenic effects
of WT1 in leukemia.

Blimp1-mediated repression of negative regulators is required for osteoclast
differentiation.

Regulation of irreversible cell lineage commitment depends on a delicate balance 
between positive and negative regulators, which comprise a sophisticated network 
of transcription factors. Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)
stimulates the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts through the
induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), the essential
transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclast-specific robust induction
of NFATc1 is achieved through an autoamplification mechanism, in which NFATc1 is 
constantly activated by calcium signaling while the negative regulators of NFATc1
are suppressed. However, it has been unclear how such negative regulators are
repressed during osteoclastogenesis. Here we show that B lymphocyte-induced
maturation protein-1 (Blimp1; encoded by Prdm1), which is induced by RANKL
through NFATc1 during osteoclastogenesis, functions as a transcriptional
repressor of anti-osteoclastogenic genes such as Irf8 and Mafb. Overexpression of
Blimp1 leads to an increase in osteoclast formation, and Prdm1-deficient
osteoclast precursor cells do not undergo osteoclast differentiation efficiently.
The importance of Blimp1 in bone homeostasis is underscored by the observation
that mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in the Prdm1 gene exhibit a high
bone mass phenotype caused by a decreased number of osteoclasts. Thus, NFATc1
choreographs the determination of cell fate in the osteoclast lineage by inducing
the repression of negative regulators as well as through its effect on positive
regulators.

CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in nonlymphoid tissues are specialized in the
cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens. However, little is known about
the mechanisms that regulate the development of these cells. We show that two
populations of CD11c(+)MHCII(+) cells separated on the basis of CD103 and CD11b
expression coexist in most nonlymphoid tissues with the exception of the lamina
propria. CD103(+) DCs are related to lymphoid organ CD8(+) DCs in that they are
derived exclusively from pre-DCs under the control of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 
(Flt3) ligand, inhibitor of DNA protein 2 (Id2), and IFN regulatory protein 8
(IRF8). In contrast, lamina propria CD103(+) DCs express CD11b and develop
independently of Id2 and IRF8. The other population of CD11c(+)MHCII(+) cells in 
tissues, which is CD103(-)CD11b(+), is heterogenous and depends on both Flt3 and 
MCSF-R. Our results reveal that nonlymphoid tissue CD103(+) DCs and lymphoid
organ CD8(+) DCs derive from the same precursor and follow a related
differentiation program.

Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML)
are late complications of cytotoxic therapy used in the treatment of malignant
diseases. The most common subtype of t-AML ( approximately 75% of cases) develops
after exposure to alkylating agents, and is characterized by loss or deletion of 
chromosome 5 and/or 7 [-5/del(5q), -7/del(7q)], and a poor outcome (median
survival 8 months). In the University of Chicago's series of 386 patients with
t-MDS/t-AML, 79 (20%) patients had abnormalities of chromosome 5, 95 (25%)
patients had abnormalities of chromosome 7, and 85 (22%) patients had
abnormalities of both chromosomes 5 and 7. t-MDS/t-AML with a -5/del(5q) is
associated with a complex karyotype, characterized by trisomy 8, as well as loss 
of 12p, 13q, 16q22, 17p (TP53 locus), chromosome 18, and 20q. In addition, this
subtype of t-AML is characterized by a unique expression profile (higher
expression of genes) involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2),
checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), loss of expression of IRF8, and
overexpression of FHL2. Haploinsufficiency of the RPS14, EGR1, APC, NPM1, and
CTNNA1 genes on 5q has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML. In
previous studies, we determined that Egr1 acts by haploinsufficiency and
cooperates with mutations induced by alkylating agents to induce myeloid
leukemias in the mouse. To identify mutations that cooperate with Egr1
haploinsufficiency, we used retroviral insertional mutagenesis. To date, we have 
identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription
factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci). Of note
is that the EVI1 transcription factor gene is deregulated in human AMLs,
particularly those with -7, and abnormalities of 3q. Identifying the genetic
pathways leading to t-AML will provide new insights into the underlying biology
of this disease, and may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic
targets.

The interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8) activates
transcription of the FANCF gene during myeloid differentiation.

The interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is an interferon
regulatory transcription factor with leukemia-suppressor activity. ICSBP
regulates genes that are involved in phagocyte function, proliferation, and
apoptosis. In murine models ICSBP deficiency results in a myeloproliferative
disorder (MPD) with increased mature neutrophils. Over time this MPD progresses
to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that ICSBP deficiency is adequate for
MPD, but additional genetic lesions are required for AML. The hypothesis of these
studies is that dysregulation of key target genes predisposes to disease
progression under conditions of decreased ICSBP expression. To investigate this
hypothesis, we used chromatin co-immunoprecipitation to identify genes involved
the ICSBP-leukemia suppressor effect. In the current studies, we identify the
gene encoding Fanconi F (FANCF) as an ICSBP target gene. FancF participates in a 
repair of cross-linked DNA. We identify a FANCF promoter cis element, which is
activated by ICSBP in differentiating myeloid cells. We also determine that DNA
cross-link repair is impaired in ICSBP-deficient myeloid cells in a
FancF-dependent manner. This effect is observed in differentiating cells,
suggesting that ICSBP protects against the genotoxic stress of myelopoiesis.
Decreased ICSBP expression is found in human AML and chronic myeloid leukemia
during blast crisis (CML-BC). Our studies suggest that ICSBP deficiency may be
functionally important for accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities during
disease progression in these myeloid malignancies.

Restriction of Legionella pneumophila replication in macrophages requires
concerted action of the transcriptional regulators Irf1 and Irf8 and nod-like
receptors Naip5 and Nlrc4.

The unique permissiveness of A/J mouse macrophages for replication of Legionella 
pneumophila is caused by a deficiency in the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein and 
intracellular sensor for L. pneumophila flagellin (Naip5). The signaling pathways
and proteins activated by Naip5 sensing in macrophages were investigated.
Transcript profiling of macrophages from susceptible A/J mice and from resistant 
A/J mice harboring a transgenic wild-type copy of Naip5 at 4 h following L.
pneumophila infection suggested that two members of the Irf transcriptional
regulator family, Irf1 and Irf8, are regulated in response to Naip5 sensing of L.
pneumophila. We show that macrophages having defective alleles of either Irf1
(Irf1-/-) or its heterodimerization partner gene Irf8 (Irf8R294C) become
permissive for L. pneumophila replication, indicating that both the Irf1 and Irf8
proteins are essential for macrophage defense against L. pneumophila. Moreover,
macrophages doubly heterozygous (Naip5AJ/WT Irf8R294C/WT or Nlrc4-/+
Irf8R294C/WT) for combined loss-of-function mutations in Irf8 and in either Naip5
or Nlrc4 are highly susceptible to L. pneumophila, indicating that there is a
strong genetic interaction between Irf8 and the NLR protein family in the
macrophage response to L. pneumophila. Legionella-containing phagosomes (LCPs)
formed in permissive Irf1-/- or Irf8R294C macrophages behave like LCPs formed in 
Naip5-insufficient and Nlrc4-deficient macrophages which fail to acidify. These
results suggest that, in addition to Naip5 and Nlrc4, Irf1 and Irf8 play a
critical role in the early response of macrophages to infection with L.
pneumophila, including antagonizing the ability of L. pneumophila to block
phagosome acidification. They also suggest that flagellin sensing by the NLR
proteins Naip5 and Nlrc4 may be coupled to Irf1-Irf8-mediated transcriptional
activation of key effector genes essential for macrophage resistance to L.
pneumophila infection.

Bone metabolism results from a balance between osteoclast-driven bone resorption 
and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Diseases such as periodontitis and
rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by increased bone destruction due to
enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Here we report that interferon regulatory factor-8
(IRF-8), a transcription factor expressed in immune cells, is a key regulatory
molecule for osteoclastogenesis. IRF-8 expression in osteoclast precursors was
downregulated during the initial phase of osteoclast differentiation induced by
receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), which is encoded by
the Tnfsf11 gene. Mice deficient in Irf8 showed severe osteoporosis, owing to
increased numbers of osteoclasts, and also showed enhanced bone destruction after
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Irf8-/- osteoclast precursors underwent 
increased osteoclastogenesis in response to RANKL and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha). IRF-8 suppressed osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the function and
expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Our results show
that IRF-8 inhibits osteoclast formation under physiological and pathological
conditions and suggest a model where downregulation of inhibitory factors such as
IRF-8 contributes to RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis.

Minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M0) is defined by immature
morphology and expression of early hematologic markers. By gene expression
profiling (GEP) and subsequent unsupervised analysis of 35 AML-M0 samples and 253
previously reported AML cases, we demonstrate that AML-M0 cases express a unique 
signature that is largely separated from other molecular subtypes. Hematologic
transcription regulators such as CEBPA, CEBPD, and ETV6, and the differentiation 
associated gene MPO appeared strongly down-regulated, in line with the primitive 
state of this leukemia. AML-M0 frequently carries loss-of-function RUNX1
mutation. Unsupervised analyses revealed a subdivision between AML-M0 cases with 
and without RUNX1 mutations. RUNX1 mutant AML-M0 samples showed a distinct
up-regulation of B cell-related genes such as members of the B-cell receptor
complex, transcription regulators RUNX3, ETS2, IRF8, or PRDM1, and major
histocompatibility complex class II genes. Importantly, prediction with high
accuracy of the AML-M0 subtype and prediction of patients carrying RUNX1 mutation
within this subtype were possible based on the expression level of only a few
transcripts. We propose that RUNX1 mutations in this AML subgroup cause lineage
infidelity, leading to aberrant coexpression of myeloid and B-lymphoid genes.
Furthermore, our results imply that AML-M0, although originally determined by
morphology, constitutes a leukemia subgroup.

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor that affects the
differentiation and function of myeloid, dendritic, and B cells. Herein we report
that IRF8 regulates the expression of Mdm2, a suppressor of p53-dependent and
-independent apoptosis pathways, in germinal center (GC) B cells. In GC B cells
of IRF8-deficient mice, Mdm2 transcripts were greatly down-regulated, and MDM2
protein was poorly expressed in GC of Irf8(-/-) mice. Small interfering
RNA-induced repression of IRF8 in a GC-derived B cell line resulted in decreased 
expression of MDM2 at the protein level but increased expression of p53 and p21. 
We found that IRF8 binds to the Mdm2 P2 promoter, and that cotransfection of an
IRF8 expression vector with an Mdm2 reporter construct stimulated significant
increases in reporter activity. Additionally, transcripts of the p53 target
Pmaip1 (Noxa) were significantly increased in IRF8-deficient GC B cells as well
as in the IRF8 knockdown B cell line. Finally, cells deficient in IRF8 exhibited 
growth suppression and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by etoposide or
IL-21. These results suggest that by regulating MDM2, IRF8 might allow GC B cells
to tolerate physiological DNA breaks that otherwise would trigger apoptosis.

Acute myelogenous leukemia is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) generated by
mutations that confer (or maintain) self-renewal potential coupled to an aberrant
differentiation program. Using retroviral mutagenesis, we identified genes that
generate LSCs in collaboration with genetic disruption of the gene encoding
interferon response factor 8 (Irf8), which induces a myeloproliferation in vivo. 
Among the targeted genes, we identified Mef2c, encoding a
MCM1-agamous-deficiens-serum response factor transcription factor, and confirmed 
that overexpression induced a myelomonocytic leukemia in cooperation with Irf8
deficiency. Strikingly, several of the genes identified in our screen have been
reported to be up-regulated in the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtype. High
MEF2C expression levels were confirmed in acute myelogenous leukemia patient
samples with MLL gene disruptions, prompting an investigation of the causal
interplay. Using a conditional mouse strain, we demonstrated that Mef2c
deficiency does not impair the establishment or maintenance of LSCs generated in 
vitro by MLL/ENL fusion proteins; however, its loss led to compromised homing and
invasiveness of the tumor cells. Mef2c-dependent targets included several genes
encoding matrix metalloproteinases and chemokine ligands and receptors, providing
a mechanistic link to increased homing and motility. Thus, MEF2C up-regulation
may be responsible for the aggressive nature of this leukemia subtype.

We report the results of a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans for
multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility that includes 2,624 subjects with MS and
7,220 control subjects. Replication in an independent set of 2,215 subjects with 
MS and 2,116 control subjects validates new MS susceptibility loci at TNFRSF1A
(combined P = 1.59 x 10(-11)), IRF8 (P = 3.73 x 10(-9)) and CD6 (P = 3.79 x
10(-9)). TNFRSF1A harbors two independent susceptibility alleles: rs1800693 is a 
common variant with modest effect (odds ratio = 1.2), whereas rs4149584 is a
nonsynonymous coding polymorphism of low frequency but with stronger effect
(allele frequency = 0.02; odds ratio = 1.6). We also report that the
susceptibility allele near IRF8, which encodes a transcription factor known to
function in type I interferon signaling, is associated with higher mRNA
expression of interferon-response pathway genes in subjects with MS.

The tripartite motif (TRIM) family member, TRIM21, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for 
IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IRF8 that functions in both innate and acquired 
immunity. It is also an autoantigen known as Ro52/SS-A. The function of TRIM21 in
vivo, however, has remained elusive. We generated Trim21(-/-) mice with the
Trim21 gene replaced by an enhanced GFP (EGFP) reporter. EGFP expression analyses
showed that Trim21 was widely expressed in many tissues, with the highest levels 
in immune cells. Studies of Trim21(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that
TLR-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1beta, IL-6,
TNF-alpha, and CXCL10, was consistently up-regulated relative to wild-type cells.
Reporter analyses demonstrated that TLR-mediated NF-kappaB activation was higher 
in Trim21(-/-) cells than in wild-type cells, most likely accounting for their
enhanced cytokine expression. In contrast, functional analyses of immune cells
from Trim21(-/-) mice revealed no abnormalities in their composition or function,
even though ubiquitylation of IRF3 and IRF8 was impaired. These results suggested
possible redundancies in activities mediated by TRIM21. In keeping with this
concept, we found that a number of TRIM family members were up-regulated in
Trim21(-/-) cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TRIM21 plays a
previously unrecognized role in the negative regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent
proinflammatory cytokine responses, and suggest that multiple TRIM proteins
contribute to the maintenance of functional equilibrium in inflammatory
responses, in part through functional redundancy.

Prior studies have demonstrated that cholera toxin (CT) and other cAMP-inducing
factors inhibit interleukin (IL)-12 production from monocytes and dendritic cells
(DCs). We show that CT inhibits Th1 responses in vivo in mice infected with
Toxoplasma gondii. This correlated with low serum IL-12 levels and a selective
reduction in the numbers of CD8alpha(+) conventional DCs (cDCs) in lymphoid
organs. CT inhibited the function of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 8, 
a transcription factor known to positively regulate IL-12p35 and p40 gene
expression, and the differentiation of CD8alpha(+) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs).
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that exposure to CT,
forskolin, or dibutyryl (db) cAMP blocked LPS and IFN-gamma-induced IRF8 binding 
to chromatin. Moreover, CT and dbcAMP inhibited the binding of IRF8 to the
IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-like element in the mouse IL-12p40
promoter, likely by blocking the formation of ISRE-binding IRF1-IRF8
heterocomplexes. Furthermore, CT inhibited the differentiation of pDCs from
fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand-treated bone marrow cells in vitro. Therefore, 
because IRF8 is essential for IL-12 production and the differentiation of
CD8alpha(+) cDCs and pDCs, these data suggest that CT and other Gs-protein
agonists can affect IL-12 production and DC differentiation via a common
mechanism involving IRF8.

Pax5 is an essential regulator of B cell identity and function. Here, we used
transgenesis and deletion mapping to identify a potent enhancer in intron 5 of
the Pax5 locus. This enhancer in combination with the promoter region was
sufficient to recapitulate the B lymphoid expression of Pax5. The enhancer was
silenced by DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells, but became activated in
multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. It contained functional binding sites for 
the transcription factors PU.1, IRF4, IRF8, and NF-kappaB, suggesting that these 
regulators contribute to sequential enhancer activation in hematopoietic
progenitors and during B cell development. In contrast, the promoter region was
repressed by Polycomb group proteins in non-B cells and was activated only at the
onset of pro-B cell development through induction of chromatin remodeling by the 
transcription factor EBF1. These experiments demonstrate a stepwise activation of
Pax5 in early lymphopoiesis and provide mechanistic insights into the process of 
B cell commitment.

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) has been shown to suppress tumor development at
least partly through regulating apoptosis of tumor cells; however, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying IRF8 regulation of apoptosis are still not fully
understood. Here, we showed that disrupting IRF8 function resulted in inhibition 
of cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase cleavage in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) cells. Inhibition of the
mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis signaling cascade is apparently due to blockage
of caspase-8 and Bid activation. Analysis of signaling events upstream of
caspase-8 revealed that disrupting IRF8 function dramatically increases FLIP mRNA
stability, resulting in increased IRF8 protein level. Furthermore, primary
myeloid cells isolated from IRF8-null mice also exhibited increased FLIP protein 
level, suggesting that IRF8 might be a general repressor of FLIP. Nuclear IRF8
protein was absent in 92% (55 of 60) of human STS specimens, and 99% (59 of 60)
of human STS specimens exhibited FLIP expression, suggesting that the nuclear
IRF8 protein level is inversely correlated with FLIP level in vivo. Silencing
FLIP expression significantly increased human sarcoma cells to both FasL-induced 
and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced
apoptosis, and ectopic expression of IRF8 also significantly increased the
sensitivity of these human sarcoma cells to FasL- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Taken together, our data suggest that IRF8 mediates FLIP expression level to
regulate apoptosis and targeting IRF8 expression is a potentially effective
therapeutic strategy to sensitize apoptosis-resistant human STS to apoptosis,
thereby possibly overcoming chemoresistance of STS, currently a major obstacle in
human STS therapy.

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is both constitutively expressed and IFN-gamma
inducible in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. We have shown that IRF8
expression is silenced by DNA methylation in human colon carcinoma cells, but the
molecular mechanism underlying methylation-dependent IRF8 silencing remains
elusive. In this study, we observed that IRF8 protein level is inversely
correlated with the methylation status of the IRF8 promoter and the metastatic
phenotype in human colorectal carcinoma specimens in vivo. Demethylation
treatment or knocking down DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression rendered the tumor cells
responsive to IFN-gamma to activate IRF8 transcription in vitro. Bisulfite
genomic DNA sequencing revealed that the entire CpG island of the IRF8 promoter
is methylated. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed that DNA methylation
does not directly inhibit IFN-gamma-activated phosphorylated signal transducer
and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1) binding to the IFN-gamma activation
site element in the IRF8 promoter in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
revealed that pSTAT1 is associated with the IFN-gamma activation site element of 
the IRF8 promoter in vivo regardless of the methylation status of the IRF8
promoter. However, DNA methylation results in preferential association of PIAS1, 
a potent inhibitor of pSTAT1, with pSTAT1 in the methylated IRF8 promoter region.
Silencing methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1 (MBD1) expression resulted in IRF8 
activation by IFN-gamma in human colon carcinoma cells with methylated IRF8
promoter. Our data thus suggest that human colon carcinoma cells silence
IFN-gamma-activated IRF8 expression through MBD1-dependent and PIAS1-mediated
inhibition of pSTAT1 function at the methylated IRF8 promoter.

multiple myeloma.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is presently an incurable malignant plasma cell 
tumor. The objective of this study was to investigate expression of the
interferon regulatory factor family (IRF1-9) and the potential role of DNA
methylation in silencing IRF genes in MM cell lines and purified MM cells from
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a panel of 13 human MM cell lines and purified
CD138+ cells from nine MM patients, expression of IRF genes was investigated by
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.
DNA methylation of the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8)
gene was measured using pyrosequencing, and the effect of promoter methylation on
expression was analyzed by in vitro methylation of a cloned ICSBP/IRF8 promoter, 
and treatment of MM cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC).
RESULTS: Eight of thirteen of the MM cell lines were found to lack ICSBP/IRF8
expression, associated with hypermethylation of the CpG island in the ICSBP/IRF8 
promoter. We also found that ICSBP/IRF8 was significantly underexpressed in
primary MM cells, whereas the ICSBP/IRF8 promoter was methylated in only one of
nine of primary purified CD138+ MM samples. DAC-mediated demethylation restored
endogenous ICSBP/IRF8 expression, whereas in vitro methylation silenced the
promoter.
CONCLUSION: Expression of the ICSBP/IRF8 gene is silenced in a majority of MM
cell lines and primary CD138+ MM cells. DNA methylation of the ICSBP/IRF8 gene is
a frequent event in MM cell lines, but silencing is also observed in the absence 
of methylation. These results suggest that silencing of ICSBP/IRF8 expression, by
DNA methylation or other epigenetic mechanisms, may be associated with the
malignant phenotype of MM.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) represent a unique immune cell type
specialized in type I interferon (IFN) secretion in response to viral nucleic
acids. The molecular control of PDC lineage specification has been poorly
understood. We report that basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (E
protein) E2-2/Tcf4 is preferentially expressed in murine and human PDCs.
Constitutive or inducible deletion of murine E2-2 blocked the development of PDCs
but not of other lineages and abolished IFN response to unmethylated DNA.
Moreover, E2-2 haploinsufficiency in mice and in human Pitt-Hopkins syndrome
patients was associated with aberrant expression profile and impaired IFN
response of the PDC. E2-2 directly activated multiple PDC-enriched genes,
including transcription factors involved in PDC development (SpiB, Irf8) and
function (Irf7). These results identify E2-2 as a specific transcriptional
regulator of the PDC lineage in mice and humans and reveal a key function of E
proteins in the innate immune system.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a member of the IRF family of
transcription factors whose members play critical roles in interferon (IFN)
signaling pathways governing the establishment of innate immune responses by
myeloid and dendritic cells. IRF8 is also expressed in lymphoid cells and recent 
studies have documented its involvement in B cell lineage specification,
immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement, the distribution of mature B cells
into the marginal zone and follicular B cell compartment, and the transcriptional
regulation of critical elements of the germinal center reaction. Here we review
the contributions of IRF8 to B cell development from hematopoietic stem cells in 
the bone marrow and its place in the hierarchical regulatory network governing
specification and commitment to the B cell fate.

PU.1, IKAROS, E2A, EBF, and PAX5 comprise a transcriptional network that
orchestrates B-cell lineage specification, commitment, and differentiation. Here 
we identify interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as another component of this
complex, and show that it also modulates lineage choice by hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs). IRF8 binds directly to an IRF8/Ets consensus sequence located in
promoter regions of Sfpi1 and Ebf1, which encode PU.1 and EBF, respectively, and 
is associated with transcriptional repression of Sfpi1 and transcriptional
activation of Ebf1. Bone marrows of IRF8 knockout mice (IRF8(-/-)) had
significantly reduced numbers of pre-pro-B cells and increased numbers of myeloid
cells. Although HSCs of IRF8(-/-) mice failed to differentiate to B220(+)
B-lineage cells in vitro, the defect could be rescued by transfecting HSCs with
wild-type but not with a signaling-deficient IRF8 mutant. In contrast,
overexpression of IRF8 in HSC-differentiated progenitor cells resulted in growth 
inhibition and apoptosis. We also found that IRF8 was expressed at higher levels 
in pre-pro-B cells than more mature B cells in wild-type mice. Together, these
results indicate that IRF8 modulates lineage choice by HSCs and is part of the
transcriptional network governing B-cell lineage specification, commitment, and
differentiation.

IRF8, a transcription factor restricted primarily to hematopoietic cells, is
known to influence the differentiation and function of dendritic cells (DC),
macrophages, granulocytes and B cells. In human tonsil, IRF8 is expressed at high
levels by intrafollicular macrophages and DC, but at much lower levels by
tingible body macrophages in germinal centers (GCs) and little, if at all, by
follicular DC. Spleens of IRF8-deficient mice had reduced numbers of white pulp
follicles and GCs that were irregular in shape. The frequency of follicular B
cells was significantly reduced while the population of marginal zone (MZ) B
cells was increased. In addition, MZ macrophages were reduced in number and
abnormally distributed, while metallophilic macrophages were normal. These
findings demonstrate differential requirements for IRF8 among distinct subsets of
B cells, DC, and macrophages.

The inactivation of tumor-related genes through the aberrant methylation of
promoter CpG islands is thought to contribute to tumor initiation and
progression. We therefore investigated promoter methylation events involved in
cutaneous melanoma by screening 30 genes of interest for evidence of promoter
hypermethylation, examining 20 melanoma cell lines and 40 freshly procured
melanoma samples. Utilizing quantitative methylation-specific PCR, we identified 
five genes (SOCS1, SOCS2, RAR-beta 2, TNFSF10C, and TNFSF10D) with
hypermethylation frequencies ranging from 50% to 80% in melanoma cell lines as
well as freshly procured tissue samples. Eighteen genes (LOX, RASSF1A, WFDC1, TM,
APC, TFPI2, TNFSF10A, CDKN2A, MGMT, TIMP3, ASC, TPM1, IRF8, CIITA-PIV, CDH1, SYK,
HOXB13, and DAPK1) were methylated at lower frequencies (2-30%). Two genes
(CDKN1B and PTEN), previously reported as methylated in melanoma, and five other 
genes (RECK, IRF7, PAWR, TNFSF10B, and Rb) were not methylated in the samples
screened here. Daughter melanoma cell lines showed identical methylation patterns
when compared with original samples from which they were derived, as did
synchronous metastatic lesions from the same patient. We identified four genes
(TNFSF10C, TNFSF10D, LOX, and TPM1) that have never before been identified as
hypermethylated in melanoma, with an overall methylation frequency of 60, 80, 50,
and 10%, respectively, hypothesizing that these genes may play an important role 
in melanoma progression.

To assess the role of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 8 in B-cell development 
and lymphomagenesis, we studied its expression in reactive lymphoid tissues, its 
relationship to other B-cell transcription factors, and its expression in a
series of 232 B-cell tumors and 30 cell lines representing a variety of B-cell
developmental stages. We found that although IRF8 was detectable in most reactive
B-cells, its expression levels differed with developmental stage. Germinal center
B cells contained the highest levels of IRF8, with lower levels seen in mantle
and marginal zone B cells and none in plasma cells. IRF8 was coexpressed with
PAX-5, Pu.1, and B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6, and similar to BCL-6, was absent from
the small population of IRF4-positive germinal center B cells thought to be
committed to postgerminal center developmental programs. Similarly, IRF8 was most
strongly expressed in lymphomas of germinal center origin with lower levels
present in mantle cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and marginal zone
lymphomas, and no expression observed in plasmacytic/plasmablastic neoplasms. The
reciprocal expression pattern with IRF4 in reactive tissues was generally
maintained in lymphomas with some exceptions. These results suggest an important 
role for IRF8 during germinal center B-cell development and in related lymphomas,
and provide a new diagnostic marker helpful in distinguishing B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma subtypes.

16q24 is frequently deleted in multiple tumors including cancers of nasopharynx, 
esophagus, breast, prostate and liver. By array comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH), we refined a 16q24 hemizygous deletion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
cell lines. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed interferon regulatory
factor 8 (IRF8) as the only downregulated gene within this deletion. IRF8 belongs
to a family of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors that modulate various
important physiologic processes including host defense, cell growth and
differentiation and immune regulation. In contrast to the broad expression of
IRF8 in normal adult and fetal tissues, transcriptional silencing and promoter
methylation of IRF8 were frequently detected in multiple carcinoma (except for
hepatocellular) cell lines (100% in NPC, 88% in esophageal and 18-78% in other
carcinoma cell lines) and in a large collection of primary carcinomas (78% in
NPC, 36-71% in other carcinomas). Methylation of the IRF8 promoter led to the
disruption of its response to IFN-gamma stimulation. Pharmacological and genetic 
demethylation could restore IRF8 expression, indicating a direct epigenetic
mechanism. Ectopic expression of IRF8 in tumor cells lacking its expression
strongly inhibited their clonogenicity, confirming its tumor suppressor function.
Thus, IRF8 was identified as a functional tumor suppressor, which is frequently
silenced by epigenetic mechanism in multiple carcinomas.

The development of distinct dendritic cell (DC) subsets is regulated by
cytokines. The ligand for the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3L) is
necessary for plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC (cDC) maturation. The
cytokine GM-CSF inhibits Flt3L-driven pDC production while promoting cDC growth. 
We show that GM-CSF selectively utilized its signal transducer STAT5 to block
Flt3L-dependent pDC development from the lineage-negative, Flt3+ (lin- Flt3+)
bone-marrow subset. The signaling molecule STAT3, by contrast, was necessary for 
expansion of DC progenitors but not pDC maturation. In vivo, STAT5 suppressed pDC
formation during repopulation of the DC compartment after bone-marrow ablation.
GM-CSF-dependent STAT5 signaling rapidly extinguished pDC-related gene expression
in lin- Flt3+ progenitors. Inspection of the Irf8 promoter revealed that STAT5
was recruited during GM-CSF-mediated suppression, indicating that STAT5 directly 
inhibited transcription of this critical pDC gene. Our results therefore show
that GM-CSF controls the production of pDCs by employing STAT5 to suppress IRF8
and the pDC transcriptional network in lin- Flt3+ progenitors.

Productive rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus triggers a major
developmental checkpoint that promotes limited clonal expansion of pre-B cells,
thereby culminating in cell-cycle arrest and rearrangement of light-chain loci.
By using Irf4-/-Irf8-/- pre-B cells, we demonstrated that two pathways converge
to synergistically drive light-chain rearrangement, but not simply as a
consequence of cell-cycle exit. One pathway was directly dependent on
transcription factor IRF-4, whose expression was elevated by pre-B cell receptor 
signaling. IRF-4 targeted the immunoglobulin 3'Ekappa and Elambda enhancers and
positioned a kappa allele away from pericentromeric heterochromatin. The other
pathway was triggered by attenuation of IL-7 signaling and activated the iEkappa 
enhancer via binding of the transcription factor E2A. IRF-4 also regulated
expression of chemokine receptor Cxcr4 and promoted migration of pre-B cells in
response to the chemokine ligand CXCL12. We propose that IRF-4 coordinates the
two pathways regulating light-chain recombination by positioning pre-B cells away
from IL-7-expressing stromal cells.

Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are characterized by cytokine
hypersensitivity and apoptosis resistance. Development of a block in myeloid
differentiation is associated with progression of MPD to acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and portends poor prognosis. Identifying molecular markers of this
transition may suggest targets for therapeutic intervention. Interferon consensus
sequence binding protein (ICSBP, also known as IRF8) is an interferon-regulatory 
transcription factor that functions as a leukemia tumor suppressor. In mice,
ICSBP deficiency induces an MPD that progresses to AML over time, suggesting that
ICSBP deficiency is sufficient for myeloproliferation, but additional genetic
lesions are necessary for AML. Since activity of ICSBP is influenced by tyrosine 
phosphorylation state, we hypothesized that mutations in molecular pathways that 
regulate this process might synergize with ICSBP deficiency for progression to
AML. Consistent with this, we found that constitutive activation of SHP2 protein 
tyrosine phosphatase synergized with ICSBP haploinsufficiency to facilitate
cytokine-induced myeloproliferation, apoptosis resistance, and rapid progression 
to AML in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Constitutive SHP2
activation cooperated with ICSBP deficiency to increase the number of progenitors
in the bone marrow and myeloid blasts in circulation, indicating a block in
differentiation. Since SHP2 activation and ICSBP deficiency may coexist in human 
myeloid malignancies, our studies have identified a molecular mechanism
potentially involved in disease progression in such diseases.

Epigenetic modifications are critical for regulating many different aspects of
normal cell biology and tumourigenesis. Gene expression may be epigenetically
silenced by DNA-methylation and histone modifications, resulting in remodelling
of chromatin into a repressed state. We performed DNA-methylation analysis of the
ICSBP/IRF8 gene, a member of the IRF family of transcriptional regulators
expressed in monocytic and lymphocytic cells, in human monoblastic U-937 cells.
We found complete methylation of all 39 CpG positions located in a 308 bp
sequence encompassing the proximal promoter and transcriptional start site of the
ICSBP/IRF8 gene. However, strikingly, the ICSBP/IRF8 gene is still expressed.
Chromatin Immuno-precipitation (ChIP) showed that RNA-Polymerase II was present
at the major transcriptional start site. Investigating the histone modifications 
across the ICSBP/IRF8 gene we found the positive histone marks H3K9ac and H3K4me3
to be enriched at the promoter, whereas the level of H3K9me3 was low. This
suggests that an active chromatin structure, indicated by histone H3
modifications and enrichment for RNA Pol II, can over-ride the silencing effect
of DNA-methylation at the promoter, thereby permitting transcription of the
ICSBP/IRF8 gene.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are involved in innate immunity (eg, by
secreting interferons) and also give rise to CD4+CD56+ hematodermic neoplasms. We
report extensive characterization of human pDCs in routine tissue samples,
documenting the expression of 19 immunohistologic markers, including signaling
molecules (eg, BLNK), transcription factors (eg, ICSBP/IRF8 and PU.1), and
Toll-like receptors (TLR7, TLR9). Many of these molecules are expressed in other 
cell types (principally B cells), but the adaptor protein CD2AP was essentially
restricted to pDCs, and is therefore a novel immunohistologic marker for use in
tissue biopsies. We found little evidence for activation-associated morphologic
or phenotypic changes in conditions where pDCs are greatly increased (eg, Kikuchi
disease). Most of the molecules were retained in the majority of pDC neoplasms,
and 3 (BCL11A, CD2AP, and ICSBP/IRF8) were also commonly negative in leukemia
cutis (acute myeloid leukemia in the skin), a tumor that may mimic pDC neoplasia.
In summary, we have documented a range of molecules (notably those associated
with B cells) expressed by pDCs in tissues and peripheral blood (where pDCs were 
detectable in cytospins at a frequency of <1% of mononuclear cells) and also
defined potential new markers (in particular CD2AP) for the diagnosis of pDC
tumors.

The transcription factor Pax5 is essential for B cell commitment in the mouse,
where it represses lineage-inappropriate gene expression while simultaneously
activating the B cell gene expression program. In this study we have performed a 
global gene expression screen of wild-type and Pax5-deficient pro-B cells in an
attempt to identify the crucial Pax5 targets in early B lymphopoiesis. These
studies have identified 109 Pax5 targets comprising 61% activated and 39%
repressed genes. Interestingly, Pax5 directly regulates the genes encoding a
number of transcription factors that are required at the pre-B cell stage of
differentiation, including Irf8, Spib, and Ikzf3 (Aiolos), suggesting that a key 
function of Pax5 is to activate secondary transcription factors that further
reinforce the B cell program. Pax5 is also required for the expression of many
genes known to be involved in adhesion and signaling, indicating that Pax5
modulates the homing and or migration properties of B cell progenitors. Finally, 
Pax5 also represses a cohort of genes that are involved in multiple biological
processes, many of which are not typically associated with B cells. These include
the repression of the adhesion molecule Embigin, which is expressed in bone
marrow progenitors, T cells, and myeloid cells but is specifically repressed by
Pax5 in B cells.

Regulation of aicda expression and AID activity: relevance to somatic
hypermutation and class switch DNA recombination.

Expression and activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) encoded by
the aicda gene are essential for immunoglobulin (Ig) gene somatic hypermutation
(SHM) and class switch DNA recombination (CSR). SHM and CSR unfold, in general,
in germinal centers and/are central to the maturation of effective antibody
responses. AID expression is induced by activated B-cell CD40 signaling, which is
critical for the germinal center reaction, and is further enhanced by other
stimuli, including interleukin-4 (IL-4) secreted from CD4+ T cells or Toll-like
receptor (TLR)-activating bacterial and/or viral molecules. Integration of
different intracellular signal transduction pathways, as activated by these
stimuli, leads to a dynamic aicda-regulating program, which involves both
positively acting trans-factors, such as Pax5, HoxC4, E47, and Irf8, and negative
modulators, such as Blimp1 and Id2, to restrict aicda expression primarily to
germinal center B cells. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K), which
functions downstream of activated B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, likely plays
an important role in triggering the downregulation of aicda expression in
postgerminal center B cells and throughout plasmacytoid differentiation. In B
cells undergoing SHM and CSR, AID activity, and, possibly, AID targeting to the
Ig locus are regulated at a posttranslational level, including AID
dimerization/oligomerization, nuclear/cytoplasmic AID translocation, and
phosphorylation of the AID Ser38 residue by protein kinase A (PKA). Here, we
discuss the role of B-cell activation signals, transcription regulation programs,
and posttranslational modifications in controlling aicda expression and AID
activity, thereby delineating an integrated model of modulation of SHM and CSR in
the germinal center reaction.

The interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8) represses PTPN13
gene transcription in differentiating myeloid cells.

Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.

The interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8) is an interferon
regulatory factor that is expressed in myeloid and B-cells. ICSBP-deficient mice 
develop a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by cytokine hypersensitivity 
and apoptosis resistance. To identify ICSBP target genes involved in these
effects, we screened a CpG island microarray with chromatin that
co-immunoprecipitated with ICSBP from myeloid cells. Using this technique, we
identified PTPN13 as an ICSBP target gene. PTPN13 encodes Fas-associated
phosphatase 1 (Fap-1), a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase.
This was of interest because interaction of Fap-1 with Fas results in Fas
dephosphorylation and inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis. In this study, we
found that ICSBP influenced Fas-induced apoptosis in a Fap-1-dependent manner. We
also found that ICSBP interacted with a cis element in the proximal PTPN13
promoter and repressed transcription. This interaction increased during myeloid
differentiation and was regulated by phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine
residues in the interferon regulatory factor domain of ICSBP. ICSBP deficiency
was present in human myeloid malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia.
Therefore, these studies identified a mechanism for increased survival of mature 
myeloid cells in the ICSBP-deficient murine model and in human myeloid
malignancies with decreased ICSBP expression.

development in the mouse.

Among dendritic cell (DC) subsets, CD8alpha(+) DCs and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)
produce high levels of IL12 and type I interferons (IFNs), respectively, and
confer early innate immunity. Development of CD8alpha(+) DCs and pDCs requires
the interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8). Recently, a spontaneous point mutation
was identified in the Irf8/Icsbp gene in the BXH2 mouse, which exhibits an
immunodeficient phenotype similar to the IRF8 knockout (KO) mouse. We show that
this mutation, designated IRF8(R294C), abolishes the development of CD8alpha(+)
DCs without impairing pDC development, and eliminates production of IL12p40,
while retaining that of type I IFNs. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays indicated that IRF8(R294C) failed to interact with
partner transcription factors and did not bind certain promoters that require
partner interactions. Together, this work indicates that IRF8-partner
interactions play different roles in CD8alpha(+) DCs and pDCs, revealing a
mechanistic separation that underlies development of these DC subsets.

The nonobese diabetic (NOD) Nss1 and Idd5 loci have been associated with
sialadenitis development in mice. In this study the NOD Nss1 and Idd5 loci were
backcrossed onto the healthy control strain B10.Q by using the speed congenic
breeding strategy, resulting in three congenic strains: B10.Q.Nss1,
B10.Q.Nss1/Idd5 heterozygous and B10.Q.Nss1/Idd5 homozygous. We investigated the 
effects of the Nss1 and Idd5 loci on sialadenitis and gene expression in NOD
congenic mice. One submandibular salivary gland from each mouse was used for
histological analysis of sialadenitis, whereas the contralateral salivary gland
was used for gene expression profiling with the Applied Biosystems Mouse Genome
Survey chip v.1.0. The results were validated using quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR. The NOD Nss1 and Idd5 loci had clear influence on the onset
and progression of sialadenitis in congenic mice. Double congenic mice exhibited 
the most severe phenotype. We successfully identified several genes that are
located in the NOD congenic regions to be differentially expressed between the
congenic strains and the control strain. Several of these were found to be
co-regulated, such as Stat1, complement component C1q genes and Tlr12. Also, a
vast contingency of interferon-regulated genes (such as Ltb, Irf7 and Irf8) and
cytokine and chemokine genes (such as Ccr7 and Ccl19) were differentially
expressed between the congenic strains and the control strain.
Over-representation of inflammatory signalling pathways was observed among the
differentially expressed genes. We have found that the introgression of the NOD
loci Nss1 and Idd5 on a healthy background caused sialadenitis in NOD congenic
mouse strains, and we propose that genes within these loci are important factors 
in the pathogenesis. Furthermore, gene expression profiling has revealed several 
differentially expressed genes within and outside the NOD loci that are similar
to genes found to be differentially expressed in patients with Sjögren's
syndrome, and as such are interesting candidates for investigation to enhance our
understanding of disease mechanisms and to develop future therapies.

IFN regulatory factor 8 mediates apoptosis in nonhemopoietic tumor cells via
regulation of Fas expression.

IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor that was originally
identified in myeloid cells and has been shown to be essential for
differentiation and function of hemopoietic cells. Mice with a null mutation of
IRF8 exhibit uncontrolled expansion of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages
that progress into a phenotype resembling human chronic myelogenous leukemia. In 
human patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, IRF8 transcript levels are
frequently diminished. Therefore, IRF8 is a key regulator of myeloid tumor
development. In this study, we report that IRF8 is a critical regulator of
apoptosis in nonhemopoietic tumor cells. Disruption of IRF8 function with IRF8
dominant-negative mutants diminished Fas-mediated apoptosis in sarcoma tumor
cells. Both constitutively expressed and IFN-gamma-activated IRF8 were involved
in regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, it was found that constitutively
expressed IRF8 is associated with the Fas promoter to activate Fas transcription.
In addition, disruption of constitutively expressed IRF8 function diminished JAK1
expression and thereby inhibited IFN-gamma-initiated induction of STAT1
phosphorylation, which in turn, blocked IFN-gamma-induced Fas up-regulation.
Interestingly, the constitutively expressed IRF8 was also essential for TNF-alpha
sensitization of Fas-mediated apoptosis because disruption of IRF8 function also 
inhibited TNF-alpha-sensitized and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our
data suggest that IRF8 is an essential mediator of Fas-mediated apoptosis and
that IRF8 mediates apoptosis through regulation of Fas expression in
nonhemopoietic tumor cells.

Dendritic cells (DCs) produce type I interferons (IFNs) in greater amounts than
other cells, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we studied the role of a
transcription factor, IRF8, in DC induction of type I IFNs. Upon newcastle
disease virus (NDV) infection, bone marrow-derived plasmacytoid and conventional 
DCs induced IFN transcripts, exhibiting two-phase kinetics. The second,
amplifying phase represented an IFN feedback response that accounted for much of 
IFN protein production. Induction of second phase transcription required IRF8.
Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and Toll-like receptor-mediated IFN induction in DCs
also required IRF8. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that IRF7,
IRF8, and RNA polymerase II were recruited to the IFN promoters upon stimulation.
Moreover, sustained RNA polymerase II recruitment to the promoters critically
depended on IRF8. Together, these data indicate that IRF8 magnifies the second
phase of IFN transcription in DCs by prolonging binding of basic transcription
machinery to the IFN promoters, thereby playing a role in innate immunity.

Promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted auto-antigens in the thymus imposes
T-cell tolerance and provides protection from autoimmune diseases. Promiscuous
expression of a set of self-antigens occurs in medullary thymic epithelial cells 
and is partly controlled by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a nuclear protein
for which loss-of-function mutations cause the type 1 autoimmune polyendocrine
syndrome. However, additional factors must be involved in the regulation of this 
promiscuous expression. Here we describe a mechanism controlling thymic
transcription of a prototypic tissue-restricted human auto-antigen gene, CHRNA1. 
This gene encodes the alpha-subunit of the muscle acetylcholine receptor, which
is the main target of pathogenic auto-antibodies in autoimmune myasthenia gravis.
On re-sequencing the CHRNA1 gene, we identified a functional bi-allelic variant
in the promoter that is associated with early onset of disease in two independent
human populations (France and United Kingdom). We show that this variant prevents
binding of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and abrogates CHRNA1 promoter
activity in thymic epithelial cells in vitro. Notably, both the CHRNA1 promoter
variant and AIRE modulate CHRNA1 messenger RNA levels in human medullary thymic
epithelial cells ex vivo and also in a transactivation assay. These findings
reveal a critical function of AIRE and the interferon signalling pathway in
regulating quantitative expression of this auto-antigen in the thymus, suggesting
that together they set the threshold for self-tolerance versus autoimmunity.

Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) results from the
complex interaction between genes and environmental factors. Candidate gene
analysis and genome scans have been employed to identify the genes contributing
to NSCLP. In this study, we evaluated the 16q24.1 chromosomal region, which has
been identified by multiple genome scans as an NSCLP region of interest. Two
candidate genes were found in the region: interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8)
and cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 2 (CRISPLD2).
Initially, Caucasian and Hispanic NSCLP multiplex families and simplex
parent-child trios were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
both IRF8 and CRISPLD2. CRISPLD2 was subsequently genotyped in a data set
comprised of NSCLP families from Colombia, South America. Linkage disequilibrium 
analysis identified a significant association between CRISPLD2 and NSCLP in both 
our Caucasian and Hispanic NSCLP cohorts. SNP rs1546124 and haplotypes between
rs1546124 and either rs4783099 or rs16974880 were significant in the Caucasian
multiplex population (P=0.01, P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). An altered
transmission of CRISPLD2 SNPs rs8061351 (P=0.02) and rs2326398 (P=0.06) was
detected in the Hispanic population. No association was found between CRISPLD2
and our Colombian population or IRF8 and NSCLP. In situ hybridization showed that
CRISPLD2 is expressed in the mandible, palate and nasopharynx regions during
craniofacial development at E13.5-E17.5, respectively. Altogether, these data
suggest that genetic variation in CRISPLD2 has a role in the etiology of NSCLP.

determinant of apoptotic resistance and metastatic phenotype in metastatic tumor 
cells.

Apoptotic resistance is often associated with metastatic phenotype in tumor cells
and is considered a hallmark of tumor progression. In this study, IFN regulatory 
factor 8 (IRF8) expression was found to be inversely correlated with an
apoptotic-resistant and metastatic phenotype in human colon carcinoma cell lines 
in vitro. This inverse correlation was further extended to spontaneously arising 
primary mammary carcinoma and lung metastases in a mouse tumor model in vivo.
Exogenous expression of IRF8 in the metastatic tumor cell line restored, at least
partially, the sensitivity of the tumor cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis, and
disruption of IRF8 function conferred the poorly metastatic tumors with enhanced 
apoptotic resistance and metastatic capability. DNA demethylation restored IRF8
expression and sensitized the metastatic tumor cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis.
Analysis of genomic DNA isolated from both primary and metastatic tumor cells
with methylation-sensitive PCR revealed hypermethylation of the IRF8 promoter in 
metastatic tumor cells but not in primary tumor cells. Taken together, our data
suggest that IRF8 is both an essential regulator in Fas-mediated apoptosis
pathway and a metastasis suppressor in solid tumors and that metastatic tumor
cells use DNA hypermethylation to repress IRF8 expression to evade apoptotic cell
death and to acquire a metastatic phenotype.

Phosphorylation of IRF8 in a pre-associated complex with Spi-1/PU.1 and
non-phosphorylated Stat1 is critical for LPS induction of the IL1B gene.

Rapid induction of transcription is known to be mediated by factors which bind
DNA following post-translational modification. We report here that non-tyrosine
phosphorylated (NTP)-Stat1 is involved in a cooperative interaction with
Spi-1/PU.1 and IRF8 to form a pre-associated, poised complex for IL1B gene
induction. A double point mutation at a putative STAT binding site, which
overlaps this composite Spi-1 x IRF8 site located in the LPS and IL-1 response
element (LILRE), inhibited human IL1B LPS-dependent reporter activity to about 10
percent of the control wild type vector. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed
stimulation-independent constitutive binding of IRF8, Spi-1 and NTP-Stat1 at the 
LILRE, while binding of C/EBP beta was activated at an adjacent C/EBP beta site
after LPS stimulation. In contrast to Stat1, IRF8 was tyrosine phosphorylated
following LPS treatment. Supporting the involvement of NTP-Stat1, LPS-induced
IL1B reporter activity in monocytes was enhanced by ectopic expression of
NTP-Stat1 Y701F. In contrast, co-expression of a Y211F IRF8 mutein functioned as 
a dominant-negative inhibitor of LPS-induced IL1B reporter activity. In vitro DNA
binding using extracts from LPS-treated monocytes confirmed that the LILRE
enhancer constitutively binds a trimolecular complex containing IRF8, Spi-1 and
NTP-Stat1. Binding studies using in vitro-expressed proteins revealed that
NTP-Stat1 enhanced the binding of Spi-1 and IRF8 to the LILRE. Co-expression of
TRAF6, an LPS surrogate, with Spi-1 and IRF8 enhanced IL1B reporter activity in
HEK293R cells, which was dramatically reduced when Y211F IRF8 was co-expressed.
These results suggest that the rapid transcriptional induction of an important
inflammatory gene is dependent upon constitutive cooperative binding of a Spi-1 x
IRF8 x NTP-Stat1 complex to the LILRE, which primes the gene for immediate
induction following IRF8 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of chromatin
pre-associated factors like IRF8 may be an important strategy for the rapid
transcriptional activation of genes involved in innate immunity.

Macrophages are activated by unmethylated CpG-containing DNA (CpG DNA) via TLR9. 
IFN-gamma and LPS can synergize with CpG DNA to enhance proinflammatory responses
in murine macrophages. Here, we show that LPS and IFN-gamma up-regulated Tlr9
mRNA in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). The ability of LPS and
IFN-gamma to induce Tlr9 mRNA expression in BMM was dependent on the presence of 
the growth factor, CSF-1, which is constitutively present in vivo. However, there
were clear differences in mechanisms of Tlr9 mRNA induction. LPS stimulation
rapidly removed the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) from the cell surface, thereby
blocking CSF-1-mediated transcriptional repression and indirectly inducing Tlr9
mRNA expression. By contrast, IFN-gamma activated the Tlr9 promoter directly and 
only marginally affected cell surface CSF-1R expression. An approximately 100-bp 
proximal promoter of the murine Tlr9 gene was sufficient to confer basal and
IFN-gamma-inducible expression in RAW264.7 cells. A composite IFN regulatory
factor (IRF)/PU.1 site upon the major transcription start site was identified.
Mutation of the binding sites for PU.1 or IRF impaired basal promoter activity,
but only the IRF-binding site was required for IFN-gamma induction. The mRNA
expression of the IRF family member IFN consensus-binding protein [(ICSBP)/IRF8] 
was coregulated with Tlr9 in macrophages, and constitutive and
IFN-gamma-inducible Tlr9 mRNA expression was reduced in ICSBP-deficient BMM. This
study therefore characterizes the regulation of mouse Tlr9 expression and defines
a molecular mechanism by which IFN-gamma amplifies mouse macrophage responses to 
CpG DNA.

The objective of this study was to describe a novel form of primary immune
disorder characterized by circulating B cells with the exclusive transitional
phenotype which fail to respond to CpG stimulation. The 12-year-old male patient 
suffered from recurrent bacterial infections since infancy. The immunological
studies were based on extensive B cell immunophenotyping, humoral in vivo
response to different vaccine antigens, and in vitro proliferation and
immunoglobulin production after CpG stimulation. Sequence analysis for
potentially candidate genes such as IRF8, MyD88, TLR9, T-bet were performed. The 
patient's serum immunoglobulin levels and the specific antibody response to
tetanus toxoid were normal, whereas that to polysaccharide antigens was severely 
impaired. Flow cytometric analysis showed that almost all patient's peripheral B 
cells had the transitional phenotype (CD24(bright) CD38(bright) CD27(neg)).
Furthermore, the patient's B cells did not proliferate and failed to secrete
immunoglobulins after in vitro CpG stimulation. Sequence analysis for TLR9,
MyD88, IRF8 and T-bet showed no mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first
case of a novel primary immunodeficiency mimicking the clinical phenotype of
common variable immunodeficiency, with a peculiar immunological phenotype
characterized by normal immunoglobulin serum levels, circulating B cells with the
exclusive transitional phenotype unable to respond to CpG stimulation. This
defines a novel form of primary immunodeficiency mimicking common variable
immunodeficiency in the presence of normal immunoglobulin serum levels.

In this study, we provide a molecular signature of highly enriched CD34+ cells
from bone marrow of untreated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in
chronic phase in comparison with normal CD34+ cells using microarrays covering
8746 genes. Expression data reflected several BCR-ABL-induced effects in primary 
CML progenitors, such as transcriptional activation of the classical
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT
pathway as well as downregulation of the proapoptotic gene IRF8. Moreover, novel 
transcriptional changes in comparison with normal CD34+ cells were identified.
These include upregulation of genes involved in the transforming growth
factorbeta pathway, fetal hemoglobin genes, leptin receptor, sorcin, tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, the neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1
and downregulation of selenoprotein P. Additionally, genes associated with early 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and leukemogenesis such as HoxA9 and MEIS1 were
transcriptionally activated. Differential expression of
differentiation-associated genes suggested an altered composition of the CD34+
cell population in CML. This was confirmed by subset analyses of chronic phase
CML CD34+ cells showing an increase of the proportion of megakaryocyte-erythroid 
progenitors, whereas the proportion of HSC and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors
was decreased in CML. In conclusion, our results give novel insights into the
biology of CML and could provide the basis for identification of new therapeutic 
targets.

Standard chemotherapy is not curative for many patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). New treatment strategies combining demethylating agents, such as 
decitabine, and drugs that induce myelomonocytic differentiation (i.e. Vitamin
D3) may re-establish functional hematopoiesis in these patients. We studied the
effects of decitabine alone or in combination with Vitamin D3 (VD3) on U937 cells
and AML blasts. Preincubation with decitabine (0.1-1 microM) and subsequent
exposure to VD3 (3 nM) synergistically induced monocytic differentiation. To
elucidate the mechanisms of decitabine- and VD3-induced monocytic
differentiation, we investigated the effects of the two drugs on transcription
factors implicated in monocytic differentiation. Northern and Western blotting
showed that decitabine induced transcription of c-jun but not PU.1, while VD3
increased PU.1, IRF8, and C/EBPbeta but not c-jun. Using electromobility shift
assays, we demonstrated increased DNA binding of nuclear proteins from
decitabine- and VD3-induced U937 cells to the CD11b promoter. In addition, we
investigated whether the myeloid transcription factor Sp1 played a role in
decitabine- and VD3-induced CD14 expression. Indeed, we found that mithramycin A,
a specific inhibitor of Sp1, inhibited both VD3- and decitabine-induced
upregulation of CD14, which is in line with previous data showing that Sp1 is
critical for CD14 promoter activity. Induction of CD11b and/or CD14 by decitabine
and/or VD3 was confirmed in primary AML patient samples at the time of diagnosis.
In conclusion, decitabine synergizes with Vitamin D3 to induce CD11b and CD14
expression, likely by enhancing PU.1/c-jun and Sp1 transcriptional activity.

PU.1, interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 2, and the interferon consensus
sequence-binding protein (ICSBP/IRF8) cooperate to activate NF1 transcription in 
differentiating myeloid cells.

Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.

Nf1 (neurofibromin 1) is a Ras-GAP protein that regulates cytokine-induced
proliferation of myeloid cells. In previous studies, we found that the interferon
consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP; also referred to as interferon
regulatory factor 8) activates transcription of the gene encoding Nf1 (the NF1
gene) in differentiating myeloid cells. We also found that NF1 activation
requires cytokine-stimulated phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in
the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) domain of ICSBP/IRF8. In this study, we
found that ICSBP/IRF8 cooperates with PU.1 and interferon regulatory factor 2 to 
activate a composite ets/IRF-cis element in the NF1 promoter. We found that PU.1 
binds directly to the NF1-cis element, and DNA-bound PU.1 interacts with IRF2,
recruiting IRF2 to the cis element. This interaction requires cytokine-induced
phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the PU.1 PEST domain and of a
conserved tyrosine residue in the IRF domain of IRF2. We found that ICSBP/IRF8
interaction with the NF1-cis element requires pre-binding of PU.1 and IRF2. The
conserved IRF domain tyrosine in ICSBP/IRF8 is required for interaction with the 
DNA-bound PU.1-IRF2 heterodimer. NF1 deficiency in myeloid progenitor cells
results in cytokine hypersensitivity and myeloproliferation. Therefore, these
studies identify a target gene for the previously observed tumor-suppressor
effect of PU.1. Additionally, these studies identify a tumor-suppressor function 
for the "oncogenic" transcription factor, IRF2.

IFN regulatory factor 4 and 8 promote Ig light chain kappa locus activation in
pre-B cell development.

Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.

Previous studies have shown that B cell development is blocked at the pre-B cell 
stage in IFN regulatory factor (IRF)4 (pip) and IRF8 (IFN consensus sequence
binding protein) double mutant mice (IRF4,8(-/-)). In this study, the molecular
mechanism by which IRF4,8 regulate pre-B cell development was further
investigated. We show that IRF4,8 function in a B cell intrinsic manner to
control pre-B cell development. IRF4,8(-/-) mice expressing a Bcl-2 transgene
fail to rescue pre-B cell development, suggesting that the defect in B cell
development in IRF4,8(-/-) mice is not due to a lack of survival signal.
IRF4,8(-/-) pre-B cells display a high proliferation index that may indirectly
inhibit the L chain rearrangement. However, forced cell cycle exit induced by
IL-7 withdrawal fails to rescue the development of IRF4,8(-/-) pre-B cells,
suggesting that cell cycle exit by itself is not sufficient to rescue the
development of IRF4,8(-/-) pre-B cells and that IRF4,8 may directly regulate the 
activation of L chain loci. Using retroviral mediated gene transduction, we show 
that IRF4 and IRF8 function redundantly to promote pre-B cell maturation and the 
generation of IgM(+) B cells. Molecular analysis indicates that IRF4, when
expressed in IRF4,8(-/-) pre-B cells, induces kappa germline transcription,
enhances V(D)J rearrangement activity at the kappa locus, and promotes L chain
rearrangement and transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further
reveals that IRF4 expression leads to histone modifications and enhanced
chromatin accessibility at the kappa locus. Thus, IRF4,8 control pre-B cell
development, at least in part, by promoting the activation of the kappa locus.

Stages of germinal center transit are defined by B cell transcription factor
coexpression and relative abundance.

The transit of T cell-activated B cells through the germinal center (GC) is
controlled by sequential activation and repression of key transcription factors, 
executing the pre- and post-GC B cell program. B cell lymphoma (BCL) 6 and IFN
regulatory factor (IRF) 8 are necessary for GC formation and for its molecular
activity in Pax5+PU.1+ B cells. IRF4, which is highly expressed in BCL6- GC B
cells, is necessary for class switch recombination and the plasma cell
differentiation at exit from the GC. In this study, we show at the single-cell
level broad coexpression of IRF4 with BCL6, Pax5, IRF8, and PU.1 in pre- and
post-GC B cells in human and mouse. IRF4 is down-regulated in BCL6+ human GC
founder cells (IgD+CD38+), is absent in GC centroblasts, and is re-expressed in
positive regulatory domain 1-positive centrocytes, which are negative for all the
B cell transcription factors. Activated (CD30+) and activation-induced cytidine
deaminase-positive extrafollicular blasts coexpress Pax5 and IRF4. PU.1-negative 
plasma cells and CD30+ blasts uniquely display the conformational epitope of IRF4
recognized by the MUM1 Ab, an epitope that is absent from any other IRF4+PU.1+
lymphoid and hemopoietic subsets. Low grade B cell lymphomas, representing the
malignant counterpart of pre- and post-GC B cells, accordingly express IRF4.
However, a fraction of BCL6+ diffuse large B cell lymphomas express IRF4 bearing 
the MUM1 epitope, indicative of a posttranscriptional modification of IRF4 not
seen in the normal counterpart.

Transcription factor paralogs may share a common role in staged or overlapping
expression in specific tissues, as in the Hox family. In other cases, family
members have distinct roles in a range of embryologic, differentiation or
response pathways (as in the Tbx and Pax families). For the interferon regulatory
factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, mice deficient in Irf1, Irf2, Irf3,
Irf4, Irf5, Irf7, Irf8 or Irf9 have defects in the immune response but show no
embryologic abnormalities. Mice deficient for Irf6 have not been reported, but in
humans, mutations in IRF6 cause two mendelian orofacial clefting syndromes, and
genetic variation in IRF6 confers risk for isolated cleft lip and palate. Here we
report that mice deficient for Irf6 have abnormal skin, limb and craniofacial
development. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that the primary 
defect is in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. This study describes
a new role for an IRF family member in epidermal development.

Monocytic differentiation is coordinated through the ordered activation of
multiple signalling pathways, controlling transcription of specific subsets of
genes that regulate the development of the mature phenotype. To identify key
transcription factors involved in this process, we used the human monoblastic
U-937 cell line as a model of monocytic differentiation. U-937 cells can be
differentiated by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and
1,25alpha-dihydroxycholecalciferol (VitD3), resulting in G(0)/G(1)-arrested cells
expressing monocytic surface markers. We have previously shown that ATRA-induced 
differentiation and cell cycle arrest specifically requires Stat1 activation,
through phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 and serine 727. In this report, we used
U-937 cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient mutants of Stat1 (Stat1Y701F and
Stat1S727A) to determine myeloid-specific transcription factors that are
activated downstream of Stat1 during induced monocytic differentiation. We
demonstrate that ATRA-induced upregulation of Stat2, ICSBP/IRF8 and C/EBPepsilon,
key transcription factors linked to myelomonocytic differentiation, is
selectively impaired in cells expressing mutant Stat1. In contrast, ATRA-induced 
expression of PU.1, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta and IRF-1 was unaffected. Taken
together, our data suggest that ATRA-induced regulation of Stat2, ICSBP and
C/EBPepsilon is dependent on active Stat1, and that a failure to correctly
regulate these transcription factors is associated with the inhibition of
monocytic differentiation.

ICSBP (interferon consensus sequence binding protein)/IRF8 (interferon regulatory
factor 8) is an interferon gamma-inducible transcription factor expressed
predominantly in hematopoietic cells, and down-regulation of this factor has been
observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in man. By
screening about 1200 murine leukemia virus (MLV)-induced lymphomas, we found
proviral insertions at the Icsbp locus in 14 tumors, 13 of which were mature
B-cell lymphomas or plasmacytomas. Only one was a T-cell lymphoma, although such 
tumors constituted about half of the samples screened. This indicates that the
Icsbp locus can play a specific role in the development of mature B-lineage
malignancies. Two proviral insertions in the last Icsbp exon were found to act by
a poly(A)-insertion mechanism. The remaining insertions were found within or
outside Icsbp. Since our results showed expression of Icsbp RNA and protein in
all end-stage tumor samples, a simple tumor suppressor function of ICSBP is not
likely. Interestingly, proviral insertions at Icsbp have not been reported from
previous extensive screenings of mature B-cell lymphomas induced by endogenous
MLVs. We propose that ICSBP might be involved in an early modulation of an immune
response to exogenous MLVs that might also play a role in proliferation of the
mature B-cell lymphomas.

Interferon (IFN) consensus sequence-binding protein/IFN regulatory factor 8
(IRF8) is a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation and function 
of macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells through activation or
repression of target genes. Although IRF8 is also expressed in lymphocytes, its
roles in B cell and T cell maturation or function are ill defined, and few
transcriptional targets are known. Gene expression profiling of human tonsillar B
cells and mouse B cell lymphomas showed that IRF8 transcripts were expressed at
highest levels in centroblasts, either from secondary lymphoid tissue or
transformed cells. In addition, staining for IRF8 was most intense in tonsillar
germinal center (GC) dark-zone centroblasts. To discover B cell genes regulated
by IRF8, we transfected purified primary tonsillar B cells with enhanced green
fluorescent protein-tagged IRF8, generated small interfering RNA knockdowns of
IRF8 expression in a mouse B cell lymphoma cell line, and examined the effects of
a null mutation of IRF8 on B cells. Each approach identified activation-induced
cytidine deaminase (AICDA) and BCL6 as targets of transcriptional activation.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated in vivo occupancy of 5'
sequences of both genes by IRF8 protein. These results suggest previously
unappreciated roles for IRF8 in the transcriptional regulation of B cell GC
reactions that include direct regulation of AICDA and BCL6.

BACKGROUND: The persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs is the principal barrier
preventing the eradication of HIV-1 infection in patients by current
antiretroviral therapy. It is thus crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms
involved in the establishment, maintenance and reactivation of HIV-1 latency.
Since chromatin remodeling has been implicated in the transcriptional
reactivation of the HIV-1 promoter, we assessed the role of the histone
deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) on two HIV-1 latently infected cell
lines (U1 and ACH-2) gene expression.
RESULTS: Analysis of microarrays data led us to select two candidate genes: NCoA3
(Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3), a nuclear receptor coactivator and IRF8
(Interferon Regulatory Factor 8), an interferon regulatory factor. NCoA3 gene
expression is upregulated following NaB treatment of latently infected cells
whereas IRF8 gene expression is strongly downregulated in the promonocytic cell
line following NaB treatment. Their differential expressions were confirmed at
the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, NCoA3 gene expression was
also upregulated after treatment of U1 and ACH-2 cells with phorbol myristyl
acetate (PMA) but not trichostatin A (TSA) and after treatment with NaB of two
others HIV-1 latently infected cell lines (OM10.1 and J1.1). IRF8 gene is only
expressed in U1 cells and was also downregulated after treatment with PMA or TSA.
Functional analyses confirmed that NCoA3 synergizes with Tat to enhance HIV-1
promoter transcription and that IRF8 represses the IRF1-mediated activation
through the HIV-1 promoter Interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE).
CONCLUSION: These results led us to postulate that NCoA3 could be involved in the
transcriptional reactivation of the HIV-1 promoter from latency and that IRF8 may
contribute to the maintenance of the latent state in the promonocytic cell line. 
Implication of these factors in the maintenance or reactivation of the viral
latency may provide potential new targets to control HIV-1 replication in latent 
viral reservoirs.

In vitro human monocyte differentiation to macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs)
is driven by GM-CSF or GM-CSF and IL-4, respectively. IFN regulatory factors
(IRFs), especially IRF1 and IRF8, are known to play essential roles in the
development and functions of macrophages and DCs. In the present study, we
performed cDNA microarray and Northern blot analyses to characterize changes in
gene expression of selected genes during cytokine-stimulated differentiation of
human monocytes to macrophages or DCs. The results show that the expression of
IRF4 mRNA, but not of other IRFs, was specifically up-regulated during DC
differentiation. No differences in IRF4 promoter histone acetylation could be
found between macrophages and DCs, suggesting that the gene locus was accessible 
for transcription in both cell types. Computer analysis of the human IRF4
promoter revealed several putative STAT and NF-kappaB binding sites, as well as
an IRF/Ets binding site. These sites were found to be functional in transcription
factor-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Interestingly,
Stat4 and NF-kappaB p50 and p65 mRNAs were expressed at higher levels in DCs as
compared with macrophages, and enhanced binding of these factors to their
respective IRF4 promoter elements was found in DCs. IRF4, together with PU.1, was
also found to bind to the IRF/Ets response element in the IRF4 promoter,
suggesting that IRF4 protein provides a positive feedback signal for its own gene
expression in DCs. Our results suggest that IRF4 is likely to play an important
role in myeloid DC differentiation and gene regulatory functions.

MED14 and MED1 differentially regulate target-specific gene activation by the
glucocorticoid receptor.

The Mediator subunits MED14 and MED1 have been implicated in transcriptional
regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by acting through its activation
functions 1 and 2. To understand the contribution of these Mediator subunits to
GR gene-specific regulation, we reduced the levels of MED14 and MED1 using small 
interfering RNAs in U2OS-hGR osteosarcoma cells and examined the mRNA induction
by dexamethasone of four primary GR target genes, interferon regulatory factor 8 
(IRF8), ladinin 1, IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), and glucocorticoid-inducible
leucine zipper (GILZ). We found that the GR target genes differed in their
requirements for MED1 and MED14. GR-dependent mRNA expression of ladinin 1 and
IRF8 required both MED1 and MED14, whereas induction of IGFBP1 mRNA by the
receptor was dependent upon MED14, but not MED1. In contrast, GILZ induction by
GR was largely independent of MED1 and MED14, but required the p160 cofactor
transcriptional intermediary factor 2. Interestingly, we observed higher GR
occupancy at GILZ than at the IGFBP1 or IRF8 glucocorticoid response element
(GREs). In contrast, recruitment of MED14 compared with GR at IGFBP1 and IRF8 was
higher than that observed at GILZ. At GILZ, GR and RNA polymerase II were
recruited to both the GRE and the promoter, whereas at IGFBP1, RNA polymerase II 
occupied the promoter, but not the GRE. Thus, MED14 and MED1 are used by GR in a 
gene-specific manner, and the requirement for the Mediator at GILZ may be
bypassed by increased GR and RNA polymerase II occupancy at the GREs. Our
findings suggest that modulation of the Mediator subunit activities would provide
a mechanism for promoter selectivity by GR.

IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 8 is a transcription factor that directs macrophage
differentiation. By fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we visualized the
movement of IRF8-GFP in differentiating macrophages. Recovery data fitted to
mathematical models revealed two binding states for IRF8. The majority of IRF8
was highly mobile and transiently interacted with chromatin, whereas a small
fraction of IRF8 bound to chromatin more stably. IRF8 mutants that did not
stimulate macrophage differentiation showed a faster recovery, revealing little
interaction with chromatin. A macrophage activation signal by IFN-gamma/LPS led
to a global slowdown of IRF8 movement, leading to increased chromatin binding. In
fibroblasts where IRF8 has no known function, WT IRF8 moved as fast as the
mutants, indicating that IRF8 does not interact with chromatin in these cells.
However, upon introduction of IRF8 binding partners, PU.1 and/or IRF1, the
mobility of IRF8 was markedly reduced, producing a more stably bound component.
Together, IRF8-chromatin interaction is dynamic in live macrophages and
influenced by partner proteins and immunological stimuli.

We hypothesized that PU.1 and PU.1 interacting proteins (PIP) binding to the
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) promoter is involved in endotoxin-induced
upregulation of TLR4 gene expression. Our results employing chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays indicate that PU.1 binds to the murine TLR4 promoter
both in macrophage cells and, most importantly, in whole lung tissue. Treatment
of RAW 264.7 cells with endotoxin induced the association of PU.1 and the TLR4
promoter in a time-dependent manner, and this was closely tied to interactions
between the TLR4 promoter and the PIP interferon regulatory factors (IRF)4 and
IRF8. PU.1 binding was related to increases in steady-state TLR4 mRNA and total
TLR4 protein in RAW cells. Endotoxemia in animals caused the similar inducible
interaction between PU.1 and IRF4 and the TLR4 promoter in lung tissue of mice
that was treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin. PU.1
binding to the TLR4 promoter was not enhanced in the lung tissue of
endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice in response to endotoxemia. Transient
transfection studies in RAW cells indicate that inducible binding of PU.1 to the 
TLR4 promoter is abrogated by a Ser148 to Ala mutation in PU.1. These data
suggest that induction of PU.1/PIP binding to the TLR4 promoter is involved in
endotoxin response in vivo and may mediate transcriptional changes in TLR4 gene
expression.

BXH-2 mice develop a fatal myeloid leukemia by a two-step mutagenic process.
First, a BXH-2-specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. 
Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in 
clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on
chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This
Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several
positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence-binding
protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We
show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an
arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF
association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts
is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 
and interferon-gamma in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C
behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is
concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the 
presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a
two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of
Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is
required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that 
causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.

Molecular cloning of the viperin gene and its promoter region from the mandarin
fish Siniperca chuatsi.

Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, PR
China.

A viperin gene has been cloned from the mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi). From
the first transcription initiation site, the mandarin fish viperin gene extends
3163 nucleotides to the end of the 3' untranslated region, and it contains six
exons and five introns. The open reading frame of the viperin transcript has 1062
nucleotides which encode a 354 amino acid peptide. The amino acid sequence of
mandarin fish viperin shows high identities with its homologues in teleosts and
mammals except for the first 70 amino acids. A characteristic feature in the
viperin promoter region was the presence of five putative ICSBP (IRF8) binding
sites and one IRF1 binding site. The viperin gene expressed mainly in lymphoid
tissues before stimulation, but its expression can be examined in almost all the 
organs investigated after stimulation with virus or Poly I:C. The expression
pattern and promoter sequence may be considered as the indirect evidence that the
transcription of viperin is regulated by interferons or interferon induced genes.

Transcriptional control of early B cell development.

Austria. busslinger@nt.imp.univie.ac.at

The generation of B-lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells is controlled by
multiple transcription factors regulating distinct developmental aspects. Ikaros 
and PU.1 act in parallel pathways to control the development of lymphoid
progenitors in part by regulating the expression of essential signaling receptors
(Flt3, c-Kit, and IL-7R alpha). The generation of the earliest B cell progenitors
depends on E2A and EBF, which coordinately activate the B cell gene expression
program and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements at the onset of
B-lymphopoiesis. Pax5 restricts the developmental options of lymphoid progenitors
to the B cell lineage by repressing the transcription of lineage-inappropriate
genes and simultaneously activating the expression of B-lymphoid signaling
molecules. LEF1 and Sox4 contribute to the survival and proliferation of pro-B
cells in response to extracellular signals. Finally, IRF4 and IRF8 together
control the termination of pre-B cell receptor signaling and thus promote
differentiation to small pre-B cells undergoing light-chain gene rearrangements.

Transcriptional profiling during the early differentiation of granulocyte and
monocyte progenitors controlled by conditional versions of the E2a-Pbx1
oncoprotein.

The E2a-Pbx1 oncoprotein of human pre-B cell leukemia prevents differentiation
and maintains continued cell division in cultured myeloid progenitors.
Previously, estrogen-dependent forms of E2a-Pbx1 were generated that immortalized
neutrophil (ECoM-G cells) or monocyte (ECoM-M cells) progenitors and that
permitted their terminal differentiation upon estrogen withdrawal. Here,
representational difference analysis (RDA) and Affymetrix array analysis are used
to identify changes in gene expression that accompany the early differentiation
of these cells. The promoters of these genes, whose expression changes upon
E2a-Pbx1 inactivation, integrate the biochemical mechanism through which E2a-Pbx1
arrests differentiation and maintains cell division. Inactivation of E2a-Pbx1
caused the 10- to 80-fold up regulation of a small subset of myeloid
differentiation genes (MRP8, Cnlp, NB1, Bactenecin, YM1, Stefin 1, Lipocortin,
Lactoferrin, gp91 phox and Ly6-G) and a 10-fold down regulation of the TLE1
corepressor gene, as well as of a group of genes expressed in dividing cells
(c-Myc, Nucleophosmin, Spermidine synthase, NOP56, Hnrpa1). Transcription of 97% 
of cellular genes, including 300 other transcription factor genes (21 Hox genes) 
and other myeloid genes, varied less than 3-fold, with most varying less than
50%. Therefore, E2a-Pbx1 prevents transcription and maintains the cell cycle by a
specific rather than a global transcriptional mechanism. Monocyte progenitors
were distinguished by persistent expression of IRF8 and of a category of other
genes characterized as "interferon-stimulated" (ISG15, ISG20, Ifit1, Ifi202a,
Ifi203, IfiS204, Ifi204-related, IRF7 and Ly6-E.1), as well as by the
upregulation of the Lrg21 bZip transcription factor gene during late
differentiation. The synchronous expression of stage-specific and cell cycle
genes regulated by E2a-Pbx1 in these cell lines comprises a model system in which
analysis of their promoters can be used as a starting point to backtrack to the
transcriptional mechanisms of oncogenesis by E2a-Pbx1.

beta(2)-Microglobulin (beta(2)m) is a chaperone of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I (-like) molecules that play a central role in antigen
presentation, immunoglobulin transport, and iron metabolism. It is therefore of
importance that beta(2)m is adequately expressed in cells that perform these
functions, such as hematopoietic cells. In this study, we investigated the
transcriptional regulation of beta(2)m in lymphoid and myeloid cell lines through
a promoter containing a putative E box, Ets/interferon-stimulated response
element (ISRE), and kappa B site. Here we show that upstream stimulatory factor 1
(USF1) and USF2 bind to the E box and regulate beta(2)m transactivation. The
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) subunits p50 and p65 bind to the kappa B box 
and p65 transactivates beta(2)m. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), IRF2,
IRF4, and IRF8, but not PU.1, bind to the Ets/ISRE, and IRF1 and IRF3 are strong 
transactivators of beta(2)m. Together, all 3 boxes are important for the
constitutive and cytokine-induced levels of beta(2)m expression in lymphoid and
myeloid cell types. As such, beta(2)m transactivation is under the control of
important transcriptional pathways, which are activated during injury, infection,
and inflammation.
