BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complex disease that involves both genetic factors and
environmental exposures. Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as DNA
methylation, may be important in asthma development. Fetal exposure to maternal
asthma during critical periods of in utero development may lead to epigenetic
alterations that predispose infants to a greater risk of developing asthma
themselves. We investigated alterations in the DNA methylation profile of
peripheral blood from infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy.
METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 12-month-old infants born to women
with (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>25) and without (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15) doctor diagnosed asthma during pregnancy.
Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Infinium
Methylation 27 arrays (Illumina), containing over27,000 CpGs from 14,495 genes.
CpG loci in only autosomal genes were classified as differentially methylated at 
the 99% level (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01, |DiffScore|<U+2009>><U+2009>22 and delta beta >0.06).
RESULTS: There were 70 CpG loci, corresponding to 67 genes that were
significantly differentially methylated. Twelve CpG loci (11 genes) showed
greater than 10% comparative difference in DNA methylation, including
hyper-methylated loci of FAM181A, MRI1, PIWIL1, CHFR, DEFA1, MRPL28, AURKA, and
hypo-methylated loci of NALP1L5, MAP8KIP3, ACAT2, and PM20D1 in maternal asthma. 
Methylation of MAPK8IP3 was significantly negatively correlated with maternal
blood eosinophils (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.38; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.022), maternal eNO (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.44; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005),
and maternal serum total IgE (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.39, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015). Methylation of AURKA
negatively correlated with maternal hemoglobin (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.43; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.008), infants
height (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.51; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and weight (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.36; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021). Methylation of
PM20D1 was lower in infants born to mothers with asthma on inhaled corticosteroid
treatment. Methylation of PM20D1 was lower and MRI1 was higher in infants born to
atopic mothers without asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: In an Australian study population, exposure to maternal asthma
during pregnancy is associated with differential methylation profiles of infants'
peripheral blood DNA, which may act as risk factors for future asthma
development.

Obesity is a heritable trait caused by complex interactions between genes and
environment, including diet. Gene-by-diet interactions are difficult to study in 
humans because the human diet is hard to control. Here, we used mice to study
dietary obesity genes, by four methods. First, we bred 213 F2 mice from strains
that are susceptible [C57BL/6ByJ (B6)] or resistant [129P3/J (129)] to dietary
obesity. Percent body fat was assessed after mice ate low-energy diet and again
after the same mice ate high-energy diet for 8 weeks. Linkage analyses identified
QTLs associated with dietary obesity. Three methods were used to filter candidate
genes within the QTL regions: (a) association mapping was conducted using >40
strains; (b) differential gene expression and (c) comparison of genomic DNA
sequence, using two strains closely related to the progenitor strains from
Experiment 1. The QTL effects depended on whether the mice were male or female or
which diet they were recently fed. After feeding a low-energy diet, percent body 
fat was linked to chr 7 (LOD=3.42). After feeding a high-energy diet, percent
body fat was linked to chr 9 (Obq5; LOD=3.88), chr 12 (Obq34; LOD=3.88), and chr 
17 (LOD=4.56). The Chr 7 and 12 QTLs were sex dependent and all QTL were
diet-dependent. The combination of filtering methods highlighted seven candidate 
genes within the QTL locus boundaries: Crx, Dmpk, Ahr, Mrpl28, Glo1, Tubb5, and
Mut. However, these filtering methods have limitations so gene identification
will require alternative strategies, such as the construction of congenics with
very small donor regions.

Oxygen consumption can regulate the growth of tumors, a new perspective on the
Warburg effect.

BACKGROUND: The unique metabolism of tumors was described many years ago by Otto 
Warburg, who identified tumor cells with increased glycolysis and decreased
mitochondrial activity. However, "aerobic glycolysis" generates fewer ATP per
glucose molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in terms of
energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less efficient process provides
tumors with a growth advantage.
METHODS/FINDINGS: We carried out a screen for loss of genetic elements in
pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth as tumors, and identified
mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells 
decreased mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but paradoxically,
decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following Warburg's observations, this
mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in
glycolysis and accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either
mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome oxidase had a similar 
effect. Conversely, expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)
increased oxygen consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of
tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate consumption
in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor hypoxia 
and slowed tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these findings to show that non-oncogenic genetic
changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism can regulate tumor growth through
modulation of the consumption of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting
substrate for tumor proliferation.

Genomic differences between Candida glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae around 
the MRPL28 and GCN3 loci.

We report the sequences of two genomic regions from the pathogenic yeast Candida 
glabrata and their comparison to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A 3 kb region from C. 
glabrata was sequenced that contains homologues of the S. cerevisiae genes TFB3, 
MRPL28 and STP1. The equivalent region in S. cerevisiae includes a fourth gene,
MFA1, coding for mating factor a. The absence of MFA1 is consistent with C.
glabrata's asexual life cycle, although we cannot exclude the possibility that
a-factor gene(s) are located somewhere else in its genome. We also report the
sequence of a 16 kb region from C. glabrata that contains a five-gene cluster
similar to S. cerevisiae chromosome XI (including GCN3) followed by a four-gene
cluster similar to chromosome XV (including HIS3). A small-scale rearrangement of
gene order has occurred in the chromosome XI-like section.
