Primary cancer cell dissemination is a key event during the metastatic cascade,
but context-specific determinants of this process remain largely undefined.
Multiple reports have suggested that the p53 (TP53) family member p63 (TP63)
plays an anti-metastatic role through its minor epithelial isoform containing the
N-terminal transactivation domain (TAp63). However, the role and contribution of 
the major p63 isoform lacking this domain, <U+0394>Np63a, remain largely undefined.
Here, we report a distinct and TAp63-independent mechanism by which
<U+0394>Np63a-expressing cells within a TGFß-rich microenvironment become positively
selected for metastatic dissemination. Orthotopic transplantation of
<U+0394>Np63a-expressing human osteosarcoma cells into athymic mice resulted in larger
and more frequent lung metastases than transplantation of control cells.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that <U+0394>Np63a repressed miR-527 and miR-665,
leading to the upregulation of two TGFß effectors, SMAD4 and TßRII (TGFBR2).
Furthermore, we provide evidence that this mechanism reflects a fundamental role 
for <U+0394>Np63a in the normal wound healing response. We show that <U+0394>Np63a-mediated
repression of miR-527/665 controls a TGFß-dependent signaling node that switches 
off anti-migratory miR-198 by suppressing the expression of the regulatory
factor, KSRP (KHSRP). Collectively, these findings reveal that a novel microRNA
network involved in the regulation of physiological wound healing responses is
hijacked and suppressed by tumor cells to promote metastatic dissemination.

The study sought to identify genetic aberrations driving oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) development among users of shammah, an Arabian preparation of
smokeless tobacco. Twenty archival OSCC samples, 15 of which with a history of
shammah exposure, were whole-exome sequenced at an average depth of 127x. Somatic
mutations were identified using a novel, matched controls-independent filtration 
algorithm. CODEX and Exomedepth coupled with a novel, Database of Genomic
Variant-based filter were employed to call somatic gene-CNVs. Significantly
mutated genes (SMGs) were identified with Oncodrive FM and the Youn and Simon's
method. Candidate driver genes were nominated based on Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA). The observed mutational spectrum was similar to that reported by
the TCGA project. In addition to confirming known genes of OSCC (TP53, CDKNA2,
CASP8, PIK3CA, HRAS, FAT1, TP63, CCND1 and FADD) the analysis identified several 
candidate novel driver events including mutations of NOTCH3, CSMD3, CRB1, CLTCL1,
OSMR and TRPM2, amplification of the proto-oncogenes FOSL1, RELA, TRAF6, MDM2,
FRS2 and BAG1, and deletion of the recently described tumor suppressor SMARCC1.
Analysis also revealed significantly altered pathways not previously implicated
in OSCC including Oncostatin-M signalling pathways, AP-1 and C-MYB transcription 
networks and endocytosis. There was a trend for higher number of mutations,
amplifications and driver events in samples with history of shammah exposure
particularly those that tested EBV positive, suggesting an interaction between
tobacco exposure and EBV. The work provides further evidence for the genetic
heterogeneity of oral cancer, and suggests shammah-associated OSCC is
characterized by extensive amplification of oncogenes. This article is protected

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is distinguished by aggressive growth, early
dissemination and a poor prognosis at advanced stage. The remarkably high count
of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of SCLC allowed for the establishment of
permanent CTC cultures at our institution for the first time. CTCs are assumed to
have characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) phenotype, but extravasation of tumors at distal sites is marked
by epithelial features. Two SCLC CTC cell lines, namely BHGc7 and BHGc10, as well
as SCLC cell lines derived from primary tumors and metastases were analyzed for
the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers and growth factors. Expression of
E-cadherin and ß-Catenin were determined by flow cytometry. Stem cell-associated 
markers SOX17, a-fetoprotein, OCT-3/4, KDR, Otx2, GATA-4, Nanog, HCG, TP63 and
Goosecoid were not expressed in the 2 CTC lines. In contrast, high expression was
found for HNF-3ß/FOXA2, SOX2, PDX-1/IPF1 and E-cadherin. E-cadherin expression
was restricted to the 2 CTCs and 2 cell lines derived from pleural effusion
(SCLC26A) and bone metastases (NCI-H526), respectively. Thus, these SCLC CTCs
established from extended disease SCLC patients lack expression of stem cell
markers which suppress the epithelial phenotype. Instead they express high levels
of E-cadherin consistent with a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET or EMrT)
and form large tumorospheres possibly in response to the selection pressure of
first-line chemotherapy. HNF-3ß/FOXA2 and PDX-1/IPF1 expression seem to be
related to growth factor dependence on insulin/IGF-1 receptors and IGF-binding
proteins.

Integrated genomic analysis of 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas identified
32 recurrently mutated genes that aggregate into 10 pathways: KRAS, TGF-ß, WNT,
NOTCH, ROBO/SLIT signalling, G1/S transition, SWI-SNF, chromatin modification,
DNA repair and RNA processing. Expression analysis defined 4 subtypes: (1)
squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and (4) aberrantly
differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX) that correlate with histopathological
characteristics. Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations,
upregulation of the TP63<U+2206>N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of
pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis.
Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early
pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed
upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation,
exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2).
Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways
involved in acquired immune suppression. These data infer differences in the
molecular evolution of pancreatic cancer subtypes and identify opportunities for 
therapeutic development.

Submitted: TP63 (p63), a member of the tumor suppressor TP53 (p53) gene family,
is expressed in keratinocyte stem cells and well-differentiated squamous cell
carcinomas to maintain cellular potential for growth and differentiation.
Controversially, activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling by p63 (Patturajan M. 
et al., 2002, Cancer Cells) and inhibition of the target gene expression
(Drewelus I. et al., 2010, Cell Cycle) have been reported. Upon p63 RNA-silencing
in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines, a few Wnt target gene expression
substantially increased, while several target genes moderately decreased.
Although <U+0394>Np63a, the most abundant isoform of p63, appeared to interact with
protein phosphatase PP2A, neither GSK-3ß phosphorylation nor ß-catenin nuclear
localization was altered by the loss of p63. As reported earlier, <U+0394>Np63a enhanced
ß-catenin-dependent luc gene expression from pGL3-OT having 3 artificial Wnt
response elements (WREs). However, this activation was detectable only in HEK293 
cells examined so far, and involved a p53 family-related sequence 5' to the WREs.
In Wnt3-expressing SAOS-2 cells, <U+0394>Np63a rather strongly inhibited transcription
of pGL3-OT. Importantly, <U+0394>Np63a repressed WREs isolated from the regulatory
regions of MMP7. <U+0394>Np63a-TCF4 association occurred in their soluble forms in the
nucleus. Furthermore, p63 and TCF4 coexisted at a WRE of MMP7 on the chromatin,
where ß-catenin recruitment was attenuated. The combined results indicate that
<U+0394>Np63a serves as a repressor that regulates ß-catenin-mediated gene expression.

Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.

The ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate syndrome 3 (EEC3;
OMIM #604292), the Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS), and various other syndromes are
caused by mutations in the TP63 gene, which encodes a p53-like transcription
factor. Here, we report on a woman aged 37 years and her daughter aged 3 years
with the previously reported c.1028G>A (p.Arg343Gln) mutation in exon 8 of TP63. 
The mother lacked ectrodactyly, indicating a diagnosis of RHS, whereas the girl
presented with all three major features (ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia,
clefting) and different minor features (including small and brittle nails, and
recurrent conjunctivitis believed to be because of stenotic and blocked
nasolacrimal ducts) of the EEC3 syndrome. The EEC and EEC-like syndromes are
usually distinguished on the basis of the clinical findings; however, these
syndromes show a huge variability in features because of variable expressivity
and incomplete penetrance, making the correct clinical assignment difficult. In
EEC3 syndrome and RHS, a clustering of mutations in the different domains of TP63
can be observed. Our findings indicate the clinical variability with TP63
mutations and underline that in the case of two syndromes being clinically
possible in a patient, the final diagnosis should be assigned only after
molecular diagnostics.

The role of p53 family member p63 in oncogenesis is the subject of controversy.
Limited research has been done on the clinical implications of p63 expression in 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In this study, we assessed p63 expression 
in de novo DLBCL samples (n=795) by immunohistochemistry with a
pan-p63-monoclonal antibody and correlated it with other clinicopathologic
factors and clinical outcomes. p63 expression was observed in 42.5% of DLBCL, did
not correlate with p53 levels, but correlated with p21, MDM2, p16INK4A, Ki-67,
Bcl-6, IRF4/MUM-1 and CD30 expression, REL gains, and BCL6 translocation. p63 was
an independent favorable prognostic factor in DLBCL, which was most significant
in patients with International Prognostic Index (IPI) >2, and in
activated-B-cell-like DLBCL patients with wide- type TP53. The prognostic impact 
in germinal-center-B-cell-like DLBCL was not apparent, which was likely due to
the association of p63 expression with high-risk IPI, and potential presence of
<U+2206>Np63 isoform in TP63 rearranged patients (a mere speculation). Gene expression
profiling suggested that p63 has both overlapping and distinct functions compared
with p53, and that p63 and mutated p53 antagonize each other. In summary, p63 has
p53-like and p53-independent functions and favorable prognostic impact, however
this protective effect can be abolished by TP53 mutations.

Chronic erosive pustular dermatitis with a predilection for the scalp is a
hallmark of ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) caused by mutations in TP63, including
Rapp-Hodgkin and Hay-Wells EDs. It is among the most troublesome and symptomatic 
complications and is typically refractory to classic wound care approaches. We
report two cases of Rapp-Hodgkin ED with refractory scalp erosions that markedly 
improved with the use of potent topical steroids. We also note marked
similarities between this scalp inflammation and "erosive pustular dermatosis of 
the scalp," a condition more typically found in elderly individuals with severe
scalp sun damage, and speculate about possible shared pathogenetic mechanisms.

Translocation events are frequent in cancer and may create chimeric fusions or
'regulatory rearrangements' that drive oncogene overexpression. Here we identify 
super-enhancer translocations that drive overexpression of the oncogenic
transcription factor MYB as a recurrent theme in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). 
Whole-genome sequencing data and chromatin maps highlight distinct chromosomal
rearrangements that juxtapose super-enhancers to the MYB locus. Chromosome
conformation capture confirms that the translocated enhancers interact with the
MYB promoter. Remarkably, MYB protein binds to the translocated enhancers,
creating a positive feedback loop that sustains its expression. MYB also binds
enhancers that drive different regulatory programs in alternate cell lineages in 
ACC, cooperating with TP63 in myoepithelial cells and a Notch program in luminal 
epithelial cells. Bromodomain inhibitors slow tumor growth in ACC primagraft
models in vivo. Thus, our study identifies super-enhancer translocations that
drive MYB expression and provides insight into downstream MYB functions in
alternate ACC lineages.

We report a genome-wide association study of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
conducted among non-Hispanic white members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern
California health care system. The study includes a genome-wide screen of 61,457 
members (6,891 cases and 54,566 controls) genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiom
European array and a replication phase involving an independent set of 6,410
additional members (810 cases and 5,600 controls). Combined analysis of screening
and replication phases identified 10 loci containing single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with P-values < 5 × 10(-8). Six loci contain genes in the
pigmentation pathway; SNPs at these loci appear to modulate squamous cell
carcinoma risk independently of the pigmentation phenotypes. Another locus
contains HLA class II genes studied in relation to elevated squamous cell
carcinoma risk following immunosuppression. SNPs at the remaining three loci
include an intronic SNP in FOXP1 at locus 3p13, an intergenic SNP at 3q28 near
TP63, and an intergenic SNP at 9p22 near BNC2. These findings provide insights
into the genetic factors accounting for inherited squamous cell carcinoma
susceptibility.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) comprise a heterogeneous subgroup of tumors
with a generally poor prognosis. Subclassification of TNBC based on genomic
analyses shows that basal-like TNBCs, specifically the basal A or BL2 subtype,
are characterized by the expression of <U+0394>Np63, a transcription factor that has
been attributed a variety of roles in the regulation of proliferation,
differentiation, and cell survival. To investigate the role(s) of p63 in
basal-like breast cancers, we used HCC1806 cells that are classified as basal
A/BL2. We show that these cells endogenously express p63, mainly as the <U+0394>Np63a
isoform. TP63 gene knockout by CRISPR resulted in viable cells that proliferate
more slowly and adhere less tightly, with an increased rate of migration.
Analysis of adhesion-related gene expression revealed a complex set of
alterations in p63-depleted cells, with both increased and decreased adhesion
molecules and adhesion substrates compared to parental cells expressing p63.
Examination of the phenotype of these cells indicated that endogenous p63 is
required to suppress the expression of luminal markers and maintain the basal
epithelial phenotype, with increased levels of both CK8 and CK18 and a reduction 
in N-cadherin levels in cells lacking p63. On the other hand, the level of CK5
was not decreased and ER was not increased, indicating that p63 loss is
insufficient to induce full luminal-type differentiation. Taken together, these
data demonstrate that p63 exerts multiple pro-oncogenic effects on cell
differentiation, proliferation and adhesion in basal-like breast cancers.

TP63, a member of the p53 gene family gene, encodes the <U+0394>Np63 protein and is one 
of the most frequently amplified genes in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the
head and neck (HNSCC) and lungs (LUSC). Using an epiallelic series of siRNAs with
intrinsically different knockdown abilities, we show that the complete loss of
<U+0394>Np63 strongly impaired cell proliferation, whereas partial <U+0394>Np63 depletion
rendered cells hypersensitive to cisplatin accompanied by an accumulation of DNA 
damage. Expression profiling revealed wide-spread transcriptional regulation of
DNA repair genes and in particular Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway components such as
FANCD2 and RAD18 - known to be crucial for the repair of cisplatin-induced
interstrand crosslinks. In SCC patients <U+0394>Np63 levels significantly correlate with
FANCD2 and RAD18 expression confirming <U+0394>Np63 as a key activator of the FA pathway
in vivo. Mechanistically, <U+0394>Np63 bound an upstream enhancer of FANCD2 inactive in 
primary keratinocytes but aberrantly activated by <U+0394>Np63 in SCC. Consistently,
depletion of FANCD2 sensitized to cisplatin similar to depletion of <U+0394>Np63.
Together, our results demonstrate that <U+0394>Np63 directly activates the FA pathway in
SCC and limits the efficacy of cisplatin treatment. Targeting <U+0394>Np63 therefore
would not only inhibit SCC proliferation but also sensitize tumors to
chemotherapy.

Utility of next-generation RNA-sequencing in identifying chimeric transcription
involving human endogenous retroviruses.

Several studies have shown that human endogenous retroviruses and endogenous
retrovirus-like repeats (here collectively HERVs) impose direct regulation on
human genes through enhancer and promoter motifs present in their long terminal
repeats (LTRs). Although chimeric transcription in which novel gene isoforms
containing retroviral and human sequence are transcribed from viral promoters are
commonly associated with disease, regulation by HERVs is beneficial in other
settings; for example, in human testis chimeric isoforms of TP63 induced by an
ERV9 LTR protect the male germ line upon DNA damage by inducing apoptosis,
whereas in the human globin locus the <U+03B3>- and ß-globin switch during normal
hematopoiesis is mediated by complex interactions of an ERV9 LTR and surrounding 
human sequence. The advent of deep sequencing or next-generation sequencing (NGS)
has revolutionized the way researchers solve important scientific questions and
develop novel hypotheses in relation to human genome regulation. We recently
applied next-generation paired-end RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) together with
chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine ERV9 chimeric
transcription in human reference cell lines from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE). This led to the discovery of advanced regulation mechanisms by ERV9s
and other HERVs across numerous human loci including transcription of large
gene-unannotated genomic regions, as well as cooperative regulation by multiple
HERVs and non-LTR repeats such as Alu elements. In this article, well-established
examples of human gene regulation by HERVs are reviewed followed by a description
of paired-end RNA-seq, and its application in identifying chimeric transcription 
genome-widely. Based on integrative analyses of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, data we
then present novel examples of regulation by ERV9s of tumor suppressor genes
CADM2 and SEMA3A, as well as transcription of an unannotated region. Taken
together, this article highlights the high suitability of contemporary sequencing
methods in future analyses of human biology in relation to evolutionary acquired 
retroviruses in the human genome.

The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) transcriptome has been profiled
extensively, nevertheless, identifying biomarkers that are clinically relevant
and thereby with translational benefit, has been a major challenge. The objective
of this study was to use a meta-analysis based approach to catalog candidate
biomarkers with high potential for clinical application in HNSCC. Data from
publically available microarray series (N = 20) profiled using Agilent (4X44K
G4112F) and Affymetrix (HGU133A, U133A_2, U133Plus 2) platforms was downloaded
and analyzed in a platform/chip-specific manner (GeneSpring software v12.5,
Agilent, USA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering analysis was
carried out iteratively for segregating outliers; 140 normal and 277 tumor
samples from 15 series were included in the final analysis. The analyses
identified 181 differentially expressed, concordant and statistically significant
genes; STRING analysis revealed interactions between 122 of them, with two major 
gene clusters connected by multiple nodes (MYC, FOS and HSPA4). Validation in the
HNSCC-specific database (N = 528) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified a 
panel (ECT2, ANO1, TP63, FADD, EXT1, NCBP2) that was altered in 30% of the
samples. Validation in treatment naïve (Group I; N = 12) and post treatment
(Group II; N = 12) patients identified 8 genes significantly associated with the 
disease (Area under curve>0.6). Correlation with recurrence/re-recurrence showed 
ANO1 had highest efficacy (sensitivity: 0.8, specificity: 0.6) to predict failure
in Group I. UBE2V2, PLAC8, FADD and TTK showed high sensitivity (1.00) in Group I
while UBE2V2 and CRYM were highly sensitive (>0.8) in predicting re-recurrence in
Group II. Further, TCGA analysis showed that ANO1 and FADD, located at 11q13,
were co-expressed at transcript level and significantly associated with overall
and disease-free survival (p<0.05). The meta-analysis approach adopted in this
study has identified candidate markers correlated with disease outcome in HNSCC; 
further validation in a larger cohort of patients will establish their clinical
relevance.

The extant jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfish, are the
oldest group of vertebrates and provide an interesting genomic evolutionary pivot
point between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates. Through genome analysis of one
of these jawless vertebrates, the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), we
identified all three members of the important p53 transcription factor
family-Tp53, Tp63, and Tp73-as well as the Mdm2 and Mdm4 genes. These genes and
their products are significant cellular regulators in human cancer, and further
examination of their roles in this most distant vertebrate relative sheds light
on their origin and coevolution. Their important role in response to DNA damage
has been highlighted by the discovery of multiple copies of the Tp53 gene in
elephants. Expression of lamprey p53, Mdm2, and Mdm4 proteins in mammalian cells 
reveals that the p53-Mdm2 interaction and the Mdm2/Mdm4 E3 ligase activity
existed in the common ancestor of vertebrates and have been conserved for >500
million years of vertebrate evolution. Lamprey Mdm2 degrades human p53 with great
efficiency, but this interaction is not blocked by currently available small
molecule inhibitors of the human HDM2 protein, suggesting utility of lamprey Mdm2
in the study of the human p53 signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of squamous cell markers p63, p40 and CK5/6 in
small cell carcinoma of lung (SCLC).
METHODS: Immunohistochemical study for squamous cell markers (p63, p40 and
CK5/6), neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56) and TTF1 
was carried out in 283 cases of SCLC. The diagnostic value of these markers was
evaluated.
RESULTS: The expression rate of p63, p40 and CK5/6 were 20.7% (54/261), 7.9%
(5/63) and 0.5% (1/221), respectively in the cases of SCLC studied. Amongst the
squamous cell markers, CK5/6 had the lowest rate of positivity (P < 0.01). On the
other hand, chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 were positive in 61.8%
(170/275), 85.5% (242/283) and 89.2% (248/278), respectively. The positivity rate
for chromogranin A was lower than that for synaptophysin and CD56 (P < 0.01).
TTF1 was expressed in 77.2% (217/281).
CONCLUSIONS: p63 and p40 are expressed in a subset of SCLC. In contrast, CK5/6 is
rarely positive in SCLC. An immunohistochemical panel of CK5/6, synaptophysin and
CD56 is recommended for differential diagnosis of SCLC.

The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for bladder cancer has identified 
a susceptibility locus at 3q28 in the European ancestry. However, the causal
variant at 3q28 remains unknown. We conducted a three-stage fine mapping study to
identify potential causal variants in the region. A total of 41 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) across 120-kb at 3q28 were tested for association with
bladder cancer risk among 3,094 bladder cancer cases and 3,738 controls.
Resequencing and functional assays were further evaluated. The SNP rs35592567 in 
the 3'-UTR of TP63 was consistently associated with bladder cancer risk in all
three stages. In the combined analysis, the T allele of rs35592567 was
significantly associated with a decreased risk for bladder cancer (OR = 0.82,
95%CI = 0.75-0.90, P = 9.797 × 10(-6) in the additive model). Biochemical assays 
revealed that the T allele reduced the posttranscriptional levels of TP63
mediated by interfering binding efficiency of miR-140-5p. Furthermore,
overexpression of miR-140-5p inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation and
attenuated cell migration, invasion, and G1 cell cycle arrest. Together, these
results suggest that rs35592567 in TP63 may be a novel causal variant
contributing to the susceptibility to bladder cancer, which provides additional
insight into the pathogenesis of bladder carcinogenesis. This article is

A comprehensive genome-wide screen of radiosensitization targets in HeLa cells
was performed using a shRNA-library/functional cluster analysis and DNMT3B was
identified as a candidate target. DNMT3B RNAi increased the sensitivity of HeLa, 
A549 and HCT116 cells to both <U+03B3>-irradiation and carbon-ion beam irradiation.
DNMT3B RNAi reduced the activation of DNA damage responses induced by
<U+03B3>-irradiation, including HP1ß-, <U+03B3>H2AX- and Rad51-foci formation. DNMT3B RNAi
impaired damage-dependent H2AX accumulation and showed a reduced level of <U+03B3>H2AX
induction after <U+03B3>-irradiation. DNMT3B interacted with HP1ß in non-irradiated
conditions, whereas irradiation abrogated the DNMT3B/HP1ß complex but induced
interaction between DNMT3B and H2AX. Consistent with radiosensitization, TP63,
BAX, PUMA and NOXA expression was induced after <U+03B3>-irradiation in DNMT3B knockdown
cells. Together with the observation that H2AX overexpression canceled
radiosensitization by DNMT3B RNAi, these results suggest that DNMT3B RNAi induced
radiosensitization through impairment of damage-dependent HP1ß foci formation and
efficient <U+03B3>H2AX-induction mechanisms including H2AX accumulation. Enhanced
radiosensitivity by DNMT3B RNAi was also observed in a tumor xenograft model.
Taken together, the current study implies that comprehensive screening
accompanied by a cluster analysis enabled the identification of
radiosensitization targets. Downregulation of DNMT3B, one of the targets
identified using this method, radiosensitizes cancer cells by disturbing multiple
DNA damage responses.

OTX proteins, homologs of the Drosophila orthodenticle (Otd), are important for
the morphogenesis of the neuroectoderm, and for the central nervous system
formation. OTX1 and OTX2 are important for the cochlea and macula development,
indeed when OTX1 is knocked down, these organs undergo developmental failure.
Moreover OTX2 transfection revert this effect in OTX1(-/-) mice. The TA isoform
of TP63, involved in Notch regulation pathway, has a critical function in the
cochlear neuroepithelium differentiation. TAp63 positively regulates Hes5 and
Atoh1 transcription. This pathway has been also demonstrated in p63(-/-) mice,
and in patients p63 mutated, affected by Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED, OMIM 129810). 
These patients are affected by mild sensorineural deafness, most likely related
to the mutation in p63 gene impairing the Notch pathway. We demonstrated the role
of OTX2 on TAp63 regulation necessary for the correct formation of macular
neuroepithelium and we confirmed the impairment of vestibular function caused by 
p63 mutations. Although the abnormalities found in our patient were still at a
subclinical extent, aging could exacerbate this impairment and cause a decrease
in quality of life.

TAp63<U+03B3> is a homologue of tumor suppressor p53 and functions as a transcriptional 
factor playing key roles in cell cycle and cell apoptosis. In the present work,
we find that JNK1 can physically interact with N-terminal transactivation domain 
(TAD) of TAp63. Overexpression of JNK1 inhibits TAp63<U+03B3>-mediated transcription,
while knockdown or inhibition of endogenous JNK1 increases transactivity of
TAp63<U+03B3>. Further study reveals that Ser12 site in TAD is critical for
JNK1-mediated inhibition of TAp63<U+03B3>. This JNK1-mediated inhibition can impair
pro-apoptotic activity of TAp63<U+03B3>. Together, we report a novel regulation of
TAp63<U+03B3> transactivity and pro-apoptotic activity mediated by JNK1.

BACKGROUND: A new molecular marker of carcinoma in the urinary bladder is needed 
as a diagnostic tool or as a therapeutic target. Potential markers include
microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short, low molecular weight RNAs 19-24 nt long that
regulate genes associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and
development in various cancers. In this study, we investigated the molecular
mechanisms by which miR-145 promotes survival of urothelial carcinoma cells and
differentiation into multiple lineages. We found miR-145 to regulate expression
of syndecan-1, a heparin sulfate proteoglycan.
METHODS: Cell proliferation in the human urothelial carcinoma cell lines T24 and 
KU7 was assessed by MTS assay. Cellular senescence and apoptosis were measured by
senescence-associated ß-galactosidase (SA-ß-gal) and TUNEL assay, respectively.
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression of various genes,
including syndecan-1, stem cell factors, and markers of differentiation into
squamous, glandular, or neuroendocrine cells.
RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-145 induced cell senescence, and thus
significantly inhibited cell proliferation in T24 and KU7 cells. Syndecan-1
expression diminished, whereas stem cell markers such as SOX2, NANOG, OCT4, and
E2F3 increased. miR-145 also up-regulated markers of differentiation into
squamous (p63, TP63, and CK5), glandular (MUC-1, MUC-2, and MUC-5 AC), and
neuroendocrine cells (NSE and UCHL-1). Finally, expression of miR-145 was
down-regulated in high-grade urothelial carcinomas, but not in low-grade tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that miR-145 suppresses syndecan-1 and, by this
mechanism, up-regulates stem cell factors and induces cell senescence and
differentiation. We propose that miR-145 may confer stem cell-like properties on 
urothelial carcinoma cells and thus facilitate differentiation into multiple cell
types.

Epithelial barrier integrity is dependent on progenitor cells that either divide 
to replenish themselves or differentiate into a specialized epithelium. This
paradigm exists in human placenta, where cytotrophoblast cells either propagate
or undergo a unique differentiation program: fusion into an overlying
syncytiotrophoblast. Syncytiotrophoblast is the primary barrier regulating the
exchange of nutrients and gases between maternal and fetal blood and is the
principal site for synthesizing hormones vital for human pregnancy. How
trophoblast cells regulate their differentiation into a syncytium is not well
understood. In this study, we show that the transcription factor OVO-like 1
(OVOL1), a homolog of Drosophila ovo, regulates the transition from progenitor to
differentiated trophoblast cells. OVOL1 is expressed in human placenta and was
robustly induced following stimulation of trophoblast differentiation. Disruption
of OVOL1 abrogated cytotrophoblast fusion and inhibited the expression of a broad
set of genes required for trophoblast cell fusion and hormonogenesis. OVOL1 was
required to suppress genes that maintain cytotrophoblast cells in a progenitor
state, including MYC, ID1, TP63, and ASCL2, and bound specifically to regions
upstream of each of these genes. Our results reveal an important function of
OVOL1 as a regulator of trophoblast progenitor cell fate during human trophoblast
development.

Mutations in the TP63 gene have been associated with a variety of ectodermal
dysplasia syndromes, among which the clinically overlapping
Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal defects-Cleft lip/palate (AEC) and the Rapp-Hodgkin
syndromes. We report a multiplex nonconsanguineous family of Ashkenazi-Jewish
descent, in which the index patient presented with a persistent scalp skin
lesion, dystrophic nails and light thin hair. Further evaluation revealed over 10
affected individuals in the kindred, over four generations, exhibiting varying
degrees of ectodermal involvement. Analysis of the TP63 gene from four of the
patients and from two healthy individuals of the same family was performed. Gene 
sequencing of the patients revealed a nonsense mutation leading to a premature
termination codon (PTC) (p.Gln16X). The same mutation was found in all tested
affected individuals in the family, but gave rise to marked phenotypic
variability with minor clinical manifestations in some individuals, underscoring 
the clinical heterogeneity associated with the recently described PTC-causing
mutations.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in adolescents
associated with skeletal development. The molecular pathogenesis of osteosarcoma 
has not been completely determined, although many molecular alterations have been
found in human osteosarcomas and cell lines.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We questioned whether (1) we could identify gene expression
in osteosarcoma specimens that differs from normal osteoblasts and mesenchymal
stem cells and (2) this would provide clues to the molecular pathogenesis of
osteosarcoma?
METHODS: The whole-genome transcriptional profiles of osteosarcomas, including
two primary biopsy specimens, two cell lines, two xenografts derived from patient
specimens, and one from normal osteoblasts and from mesenchymal stem cells,
respectively, were quantitatively measured using serial analysis of gene
expression. A statistical enrichment was performed, which selects the common
genes altered in each of the osteosarcomas compared with each of the normal
counterparts independently.
RESULTS: Sixty (92%) of 65 total genes that were at least twofold downregulated
in osteosarcoma compared with osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells, could be
classified in four categories: (1) seven genes in the insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF) signaling axis, including three of the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) and
three of the IGFBP-related proteins (IGFBPrP); (2) eight genes in the
transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling
cascade; (3) 39 genes encoding cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins
that are regulated by TGF-ß/BMPs; and (4) six genes involved in cell cycle
regulation, including tumor suppressors TP63 and p21.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these transcriptional profiles, a coordinated theme of
clustered gene deregulation in osteosarcoma has emerged. Cell proliferation
driven by the IGF axes during bone growth is unrestrained owing to downregulation
of IGFBPs and cell cycle regulators. Tumor cells may be maintained in an
undifferentiated state secondary to impaired TGF-ß/BMP signaling. This
well-preserved pattern suggests that the alterations in the signaling axes of
IGF-1 and TGF-ß, in concert with cell cycle regulators, may be an important
pathogenic basis of osteosarcoma.
CLINIC RELEVANCE: This study provides a possible molecular basis of pathogenesis 
of osteosarcoma. This may help to develop new therapeutic targets and strategy
for this disease. Preclinical and subsequently clinical testing of inhibitors of 
the IGF-1 and TGF pathways would be warranted.

There has been some debate as to whether a subset of metaplastic Warthin tumors
(mWTs) harbor the mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC)-associated CRTC1-MAML2 fusion.
We analyzed 15 tumors originally diagnosed as mWT (mWT-like tumors), 2 of which
had concurrent MECs. We looked for the CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion transcripts and
performed immunohistochemistry for p63 and fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) for the MAML2 split. To localize MAML2 split-positive cells at the
cellular level, whole tumor tissue sections were digitalized (whole-slide imaging
[WSI]). The CRTC1-MAML2, but not CRTC3-MAML2 was detected in 5/15 mWT-like
tumors. FISH-WSI results showed that all epithelial cells harbored the MAML2
split in fusion-positive mWT-like tumors and were totally negative in
fusion-negative mWT-like tumors. A review of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained
slides showed that morphology of the "metaplastic" epithelium was virtually
indistinguishable between fusion-positive and fusion-negative tumors. However,
oncocytic bilayered tumor epithelium, characteristic to typical WT, was always
found somewhere in the fusion-negative tumors but not in the fusion-positive
tumors. This distinguishing histologic finding enabled 5 pathologists to easily
differentiate the 2 tumor groups with 100% accuracy. The age and sex distribution
of fusion-positive mWT-like tumor cases was similar to that of fusion-positive
MEC cases and significantly different from those of fusion-negative mWT-like
tumor and typical WT cases. In addition, only fusion-positive mWT-like tumors
possessed concurrent low-grade MECs. In conclusion, a subset of mWT-like tumors
were positive for the CRTC1-MAML2 fusion and had many features that are more in
accord with MEC than with WT. The term Warthin-like MEC should be considered for 
fusion-positive mWT-like tumors.

p63, a member of the p53 family, is a crucial transcription factor for epithelial
development and skin homeostasis. Heterozygous mutations in TP63 gene have been
associated with human ectodermal dysplasia disorders. Most of these TP63
mutations are missense mutations causing amino acidic substitutions at p63 DNA
binding or SAM domains that reduce or abolish the transcriptional activity of
mutants p63. A significant number of mutants, however, resides in part of the p63
protein that apparently do not affect DNA binding and/or transcriptional
activity, such as the N-terminal domain. Here, we characterize five p63 mutations
at the 5' end of TP63 gene aiming to understand the pathogenesis of the diseases 
and to uncover the role of <U+0394>Np63a N-terminus residues in determining its
transactivation potential.

Cranial neural crest cells form the majority of the facial skeleton. However
exactly when the pattering information and hence jaw identity is established is
not clear. We know that premigratory neural crest cells contain a limited amount 
of information about the lower jaw but the upper jaw and facial midline are
specified later by local tissue interactions. The environmental signals leading
to frontonasal identity have been explored by our group in the past. Altering the
levels of two signaling pathways (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) and retinoic acid
(RA) in the chicken embryo creates a duplicated midline on the side of the upper 
beak complete with egg tooth in place of maxillary derivatives (Lee et al.,
2001). Here we analyze the transcriptome 16 h after bead placement in order to
identify potential mediators of the identity change in the maxillary prominence. 
The gene list included RA, BMP and WNT signaling pathway genes as well as
transcription factors expressed in craniofacial development. There was also cross
talk between Noggin and RA such that Noggin activated the RA pathway. We also
observed expression changes in several poorly characterized genes including the
upregulation of Peptidase Inhibitor-15 (PI15). We tested the functional effects
of PI15 overexpression with a retroviral misexpression strategy. PI15 virus
induced a cleft beak analogous to human cleft lip. We next asked whether PI15
effects were mediated by changes in expression of major clefting genes and genes 
in the retinoid signaling pathway. Expression of TP63, TBX22, BMP4 and FOXE1, all
human clefting genes, were upregulated. In addition, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3 and RA
target, RARß were increased while the degradation enzyme CYP26A1 was decreased.
Together these changes were consistent with activation of the RA pathway.
Furthermore, PI15 retrovirus injected into the face was able to replace RA and
synergize with Noggin to induce beak transformations. We conclude that the
microarrays have generated a rich dataset containing genes with important roles
in facial morphogenesis. Moreover, one of these facial genes, PI15 is a putative 
clefting gene and is in a positive feedback loop with RA.

TP63 is the most ancient member of the p53 gene family. The p53 family comprises 
three transcription factors (p53/p63/p73). They share a high degree of homology
and similar domain structure. Yet, they can exist as truncated isoforms.
Alternative promoters and splicing sites lead to the generation of several
molecules. P53/p63/p73 are important to maintain cell homeostasis. P63 and p73
regulate many p53 target genes. This is due to their common structural features. 
Both proteins may compensate the loss of p53. This is a common event occurring in
more than 50% of malignancies. Yet, p63 (or p73) has its own role. Studies from
p63-null mice have shown the key role of p63 in embryo development. Several
reports have supported the p63 role in epidermal development and in skin
homeostasis. P63 involvement in heart development is currently being researched. 
Recent studies have found p63 to be "the guardian of human reproduction". In
addition, p63 has an important, even controversial, role in cancer. Here, we
provide a general overview of p63 regulation and activity. We discuss emerging
concepts about its role in germ line protection, metabolism and cancer.

Short p63 isoform, <U+0394>Np63, is crucial for epidermis formation, and it plays a
pivotal role in controlling the turnover of basal keratinocytes by regulating the
expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle and cell adhesion
programs. The glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) represents the first step of
glucose utilization in cells. The family of HKs has four isoforms that differ
mainly in their tissue and subcellular distribution. The preferential
mitochondrial localization of HK2 at voltage-dependent anion channels provides
access to ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation and generates an ADP/ATP
recycling mechanism to maintain high respiration rates and low electron leak.
Here, we report that <U+0394>Np63 depletion in human keratinocytes impairs mitochondrial
basal respiration and increases mitochondrial membrane polarization and
intracellular reactive oxygen species. We show <U+0394>Np63-dependent regulation of HK2 
expression, and we use ChIP, validated by p63-Chip sequencing genomewide
profiling analysis, and luciferase assays to demonstrate the presence of one
p63-specific responsive element within the 15th intronic region of the HK2 gene, 
providing evidence of a direct interaction. Our data support the notion of <U+0394>Np63 
as a master regulator in epithelial cells of a combined subset of molecular
mechanisms, including cellular energy metabolism and respiration. The <U+0394>Np63-HK2
axis is also present in epithelial cancer cells, suggesting that <U+0394>Np63 could
participate in cancer metabolic reprogramming.

BACKGROUND: Although numerous efforts have been made, the pathogenesis underlying
lung squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to identify 
the CNV-driven genes by an integrated analysis of both the gene differential
expression and copy number variation (CNV).
RESULTS: A higher burden of the CNVs was found in 10-50 kb length. The 16
CNV-driven genes mainly located in chr 1 and chr 3 were enriched in immune
response [e.g. complement factor H (CFH) and Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity
IIIa, receptor (FCGR3A)], starch and sucrose metabolism [e.g. amylase alpha 2A
(AMY2A)]. Furthermore, 38 TFs were screened for the 9 CNV-driven genes and then
the regulatory network was constructed, in which the GATA-binding factor 1, 2,
and 3 (GATA1, GATA2, GATA3) jointly regulated the expression of TP63.
CONCLUSIONS: The above CNV-driven genes might be potential contributors to the
development of lung SCC.

Cell identity signals influence the invasive capability of tumor cells, as
demonstrated by the selection for programs of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) during malignant progression. Breast cancer cells retain
canonical epithelial traits and invade collectively as cohesive groups of cells, 
but the signaling pathways critical to their invasive capabilities are still
incompletely understood. Here we report that the transcription factor <U+0394>Np63a
drives the migration of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells by inducing a
hybrid mesenchymal/epithelial state. Through a combination of expression analysis
and functional testing across multiple BLBC cell populations, we determined that 
<U+0394>Np63a induces migration by elevating the expression of the EMT program
components Slug and Axl. Interestingly, <U+0394>Np63a also increased the expression of
miR-205, which can silence ZEB1/2 to prevent the loss of epithelial character
caused by EMT induction. In clinical specimens, co-expression of various elements
of the <U+0394>Np63a pathway confirmed its implication in motility signaling in BLBC. We
observed that activation of the <U+0394>Np63a pathway occurred during the transition
from noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer. Notably, in 
an orthotopic tumor model, Slug expression was sufficient to induce collective
invasion of E-cadherin-expressing BLBC cells. Together, our results illustrate
how <U+0394>Np63a can drive breast cancer cell invasion by selectively engaging
promigratory components of the EMT program while, in parallel, still promoting
the retention of epithelial character.

BACKGROUND: The transcription factor p63 belongs to the p53/p63/p73 family and
plays key functional roles during normal epithelial development and
differentiation and in pathological states such as squamous cell carcinomas. The 
human TP63 gene, located on chromosome 3q28 is driven by two promoters that
generate the full-length transactivating (TA) and N-terminal truncated (<U+0394>N)
isoforms. Furthermore alternative splicing at the C-terminus gives rise to
additional a, ß, <U+03B3> and likely several other minor variants. Teasing out the
expression and biological function of each p63 variant has been both the focus
of, and a cause for contention in the p63 field.
RESULTS: Here we have taken advantage of a burgeoning RNA-Seq based genomic
data-sets to examine the global expression profiles of p63 isoforms across
commonly utilized human cell-lines and major tissues and organs. Consistent with 
earlier studies, we find <U+0394>Np63 transcripts, primarily that of the <U+0394>Np63a
isoforms, to be expressed in most cells of epithelial origin such as those of
skin and oral tissues, mammary glands and squamous cell carcinomas. In contrast, 
TAp63 is not expressed in the majority of normal cell-types and tissues; rather
it is selectively expressed at moderate to high levels in a subset of Burkitt's
and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines. We verify this differential
expression pattern of p63 isoforms by Western blot analysis, using newly
developed <U+0394>N and TA specific antibodies. Furthermore using unsupervised
clustering of human cell lines, tissues and organs, we show that <U+0394>Np63 and TAp63 
driven transcriptional networks involve very distinct sets of molecular players, 
which may underlie their different biological functions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we report comprehensive and global expression profiles
of p63 isoforms and their relationship to p53/p73 and other potential
transcriptional co-regulators. We curate publicly available data generated in
part by consortiums such as ENCODE, FANTOM and Human Protein Atlas to delineate
the vastly different transcriptomic landscapes of <U+0394>Np63 and TAp63. Our studies
help not only in dispelling prevailing myths and controversies on p63 expression 
in commonly used human cell lines but also augur new isoform- and cell
type-specific activities of p63.

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) possess fascinating self-renewal capacity and
multipotency, which play important roles in mammalian hair growth and skin wound 
repair. Although HFSCs from other mammalian species have been obtained, the
characteristics of ovine HFSCs, as well as the methods to isolate them have not
been well addressed. Here, we report an efficient strategy to obtain multipotent 
ovine HFSCs. Through microdissection and organ culture, we obtained keratinocytes
that grew from the bulge area of vibrissa hair follicles, and even abundant
keratinocytes were harvested from a single hair follicle. These bulge-derived
keratinocytes are highly positive for Krt15, Krt14, Tp63, Krt19 and Itga6; in
addition to their strong proliferation abilities in vitro, these keratinocytes
formed new epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands in skin reconstitution 
experiments, showing that these are HFSCs from the bulge outer root sheath. Taken
together, we developed an efficient in vitro system to enrich ovine HFSCs,
providing enough HFSCs for the investigations about the ovine hair cycle, aiming 
to promote wool production in the future.

NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), a subtype of squamous cell cancer, is one of the
most aggressive human solid malignancies known. NMC is driven by the creation of 
a translocation oncoprotein, BRD4-NUT, which blocks differentiation and drives
growth of NMC cells. BRD4-NUT forms distinctive nuclear foci in patient tumors,
which we found correlate with ~100 unprecedented, hyperacetylated expanses of
chromatin that reach up to 2 Mb in size. These "megadomains" appear to be the
result of aberrant, feed-forward loops of acetylation and binding of acetylated
histones that drive transcription of underlying DNA in NMC patient cells and
naïve cells induced to express BRD4-NUT. Megadomain locations are typically cell 
lineage-specific; however, the cMYC and TP63 regions are targeted in all NMCs
tested and play functional roles in tumor growth. Megadomains appear to originate
from select pre-existing enhancers that progressively broaden but are ultimately 
delimited by topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Therefore, our
findings establish a basis for understanding the powerful role played by
large-scale chromatin organization in normal and aberrant lineage-specific gene
transcription.

INTRODUCTION: Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive subtype often
characterized by distant metastasis, poor patient prognosis, and limited
treatment options. Therefore, the discovery of alternative targets to restrain
its metastatic potential is urgently needed. In this study, we aimed to identify 
novel genes that drive metastasis of BLBC and to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms of action.
METHODS: An unbiased approach using gene expression profiling of a BLBC
progression model and in silico leveraging of pre-existing tumor transcriptomes
were used to uncover metastasis-promoting genes. Lentiviral-mediated knockdown of
interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Ralpha2) coupled with whole-body in vivo
bioluminescence imaging was performed to assess its role in regulating breast
cancer tumor growth and lung metastasis. Gene expression microarray analysis was 
followed by in vitro validation and cell migration assays to elucidate the
downstream molecular pathways involved in this process.
RESULTS: We found that overexpression of the decoy receptor IL13Ralpha2 is
significantly enriched in basal compared with luminal primary breast tumors as
well as in a subset of metastatic basal-B breast cancer cells. Importantly,
breast cancer patients with high-grade tumors and increased IL13Ralpha2 levels
had significantly worse prognosis for metastasis-free survival compared with
patients with low expression. Depletion of IL13Ralpha2 in metastatic breast
cancer cells modestly delayed primary tumor growth but dramatically suppressed
lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, IL13Ralpha2 silencing was associated with
enhanced IL-13-mediated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 6 (STAT6) and impaired migratory ability of metastatic breast
cancer cells. Interestingly, genome-wide transcriptional analysis revealed that
IL13Ralpha2 knockdown and IL-13 treatment cooperatively upregulated the
metastasis suppressor tumor protein 63 (TP63) in a STAT6-dependent manner. These 
observations are consistent with increased metastasis-free survival of breast
cancer patients with high levels of TP63 and STAT6 expression and suggest that
the STAT6-TP63 pathway could be involved in impairing metastatic dissemination of
breast cancer cells to the lungs.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that IL13Ralpha2 could be used as a promising
biomarker to predict patient outcome and provide a rationale for assessing the
efficacy of anti-IL13Ralpha2 therapies in a subset of highly aggressive
basal-like breast tumors as a strategy to prevent metastatic disease.

The TP63 gene codes for two major isoform types, TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63, with probable
opposite roles in tumorigenesis. The <U+0394>Np63a protein is frequently amplified and
overexpressed in different epithelial tumors. Accordingly, it has been considered
a potential oncogene. Nonetheless, a possible metastatic suppressor activity has 
also been suggested based on the experimental observation that its expression is 
reduced or even absent in advanced invasive tumors. Such metastatic suppressor
activities are often related to tumors bearing point mutated TP53 gene. However, 
its potential roles in TP53-deficient tumors are poorly characterized. Here we
show that in spontaneous tumors, induced by the epidermal-specific Trp53
ablation, the reduction of <U+0394>Np63 expression is an early event, whereas it is
re-expressed in the lung metastatic lesions. Using knock down and ectopic
expression approaches, we show that <U+0394>Np63 expression opposes the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduces the metastatic potential of the
cells. This process occurs through the modulation of <U+0394>Np63-dependent downstream
targets (including transcription factors and microRNAs) likely to play metastatic
roles. Further, <U+0394>Np63 also favors the expression of factors involved in iPS
reprogramming, thus suggesting that it can also modulate specific stem cell
traits in mouse epidermal tumor cells. Overall, our data assign antimetastatic
roles to <U+0394>Np63 in the context of p53 deficiency and epidermis.

<U+0394>Np63 is required for both the proliferation and differentiation of
keratinocytes, but its role in the differentiation of these cells is poorly
understood. The corresponding gene, TP63, harbors the MIR944 sequence within its 
intron. However, the mechanism of biogenesis and the function of miR-944 are
unknown. We found that miR-944 is highly expressed in keratinocytes, in a manner 
that is concordant with that of <U+0394>Np63 mRNA, but the regulation of miR-944
expression under various conditions did not correspond with that of <U+0394>Np63.
Bioinformatics analysis and functional studies demonstrated that MIR944 has its
own promoter. We demonstrate here that MIR944 is a target of <U+0394>Np63. Promoter
analysis revealed that the activity of the MIR944 promoter was markedly enhanced 
by the binding of <U+0394>Np63, which was maintained by the supportive action of AP-2
during keratinocyte differentiation. Our results indicated that miR-944
biogenesis is dependent on <U+0394>Np63 protein, even though it is generated from <U+0394>Np63 
mRNA-independent transcripts. We also demonstrated that miR-944 induces keratin 1
and keratin 10 expression by inhibiting ERK signaling and upregulating p53
expression. Our findings suggested that miR-944, as an intronic miRNA and a
direct target of <U+0394>Np63, contributes to the function of <U+0394>Np63 in the induction of 
epidermal differentiation.

BACKGROUND: The airway epithelial cell plays a central role in coordinating the
pulmonary response to injury and inflammation. Here, transforming growth factor-ß
(TGFß) activates gene expression programs to induce stem cell-like properties,
inhibit expression of differentiated epithelial adhesion proteins and express
mesenchymal contractile proteins. This process is known as epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT); although much is known about the role of EMT in cellular
metastasis in an oncogene-transformed cell, less is known about Type II EMT, that
occurring in normal epithelial cells. In this study, we applied next generation
sequencing (RNA-Seq) in primary human airway epithelial cells to understand the
gene program controlling Type II EMT and how cytokine-induced inflammation
modifies it.
RESULTS: Generalized linear modeling was performed on a two-factor RNA-Seq
experiment of 6 treatments of telomerase immortalized human small airway
epithelial cells (3 replicates). Using a stringent cut-off, we identified 3,478
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to EMT. Unbiased transcription 
factor enrichment analysis identified three clusters of EMT regulators, one
including SMADs/TP63 and another NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA. Surprisingly, we also observed 527
of the EMT DEGs were also regulated by the TNF-NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA pathway. This Type II
EMT program was compared to Type III EMT in TGFß stimulated A549 alveolar lung
cancer cells, revealing significant functional differences. Moreover, we observe 
that Type II EMT modifies the outcome of the TNF program, reducing IFN signaling 
and enhancing integrin signaling. We confirmed experimentally that TGFß-induced
the NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA pathway by observing a 2-fold change in NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA nuclear
translocation. A small molecule IKK inhibitor blocked TGFß-induced core
transcription factor (SNAIL1, ZEB1 and Twist1) and mesenchymal gene (FN1 and VIM)
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that NF-<U+03BA>B/RelA controls a SMAD-independent gene
network whose regulation is required for initiation of Type II EMT. Type II EMT
dramatically affects the induction and kinetics of TNF-dependent gene networks.

Three children from an expanded consanguineous Kuwaiti kindred presented with
ankyloblepharon, sparse and curly hair, and hypoplastic nails, suggestive of
CHAND syndrome (OMIM 214350) that belongs to the heterogeneous spectrum of
ectodermal dysplasias. After exclusion of pathogenic mutations in TP63 we
performed homozygosity mapping, followed by exome sequencing of one affected
individual. We initially identified three homozygous mutations in the linked
region, located in PWP2, MX2 and RIPK4. Recently, mutations in RIPK4 have been
reported in Bartsocas-Papas syndrome (OMIM 263650) that shows overlapping
clinical symptoms with the phenotype observed in the affected individuals studied
here. Subsequent analysis of affected and non-affected family members showed that
mutation c.850G>A (p.Glu284Lys) in RIPK4 was in complete segregation with the
disease phenotype, in accordance with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern,
thus supporting pathogenicity of this variant. Interestingly, however, our
patients did not have cleft lip/palate, a common feature encountered in
Bartsocas-Papas syndrome. Whereas in Bartsocas-Papas syndromes missense mutations
are usually located within the serin/threonin kinase of RIPK4, the mutation
detected in our family resides just outside of the kinase domain, which could
explain the milder phenotype. Our data raise the question if CHAND syndrome
indeed is a distinct entity. Alternatively, CHAND and Bartsocas-Papas syndrome
might be allelic disorders or RIPK4 mutations could confer varying degrees of
phenotypic severity, depending on their localization within or outside
functionally important domains. Our findings indicate that making an accurate
diagnosis based only on the prevailing clinical symptoms is challenging.

We report on a 3-year-old male with intellectual disability (ID), characteristic 
facial features, polydactyly and epilepsy carrying a paternally inherited 3q28
deletion of 1.9 Mb. The father, carrying the same deletion, presents with cleft
palate, nail dystrophy and learning difficulties. The deleted region in this
family is one of the smallest so far reported among genomic deletions affecting
3q27-3q28 for which some phenotypic descriptions are available. In particular,
since the phenotype of our proband is strikingly similar to that previously
described in a patient with a 9.3 Mb deletion, the deletion identified in this
report contributes to the definition of the molecular boundaries of a genomic
region responsible for a distinct clinical phenotype. Within the deleted interval
there are 9 annotated genes, including TP63. Gain of function mutations of TP63
are known to be responsible for a group of conditions with distal limb and
ectodermal involvement, such as ADULT, EEC, LMS, and SHFM4 syndromes.
Interestingly, our cases demonstrate a milder phenotypic effect for loss of
function of this gene.

PKCd and p63 are respectively reported to play important roles in cell apoptosis.
But there is no report on interaction between them in regulation of apoptosis. In
the present study, we found that PKCd can directly associate and up-regulate TA
isoforms of p63 (TAp63) proteins via increasing their stability. PKCd kinase
activity and Thr157 site in TAp63 are crucial for this PKCd-induced accumulation 
of TAp63. PKCd can also enhance TAp63-mediated transcription and cell apoptosis. 
Taken together, our data indicate that PKCd phosphorylates TAp63 proteins at
Thr157 to stabilize them and promote cell apoptosis.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the developed
world. Both inherited high-penetrance mutations in BRCA2 (ref. 2), ATM, PALB2
(ref. 4), BRCA1 (ref. 5), STK11 (ref. 6), CDKN2A and mismatch-repair genes and
low-penetrance loci are associated with increased risk. To identify new risk
loci, we performed a genome-wide association study on 9,925 pancreatic cancer
cases and 11,569 controls, including 4,164 newly genotyped cases and 3,792
controls in 9 studies from North America, Central Europe and Australia. We
identified three newly associated regions: 17q25.1 (LINC00673, rs11655237, odds
ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.34, P = 1.42 × 10(-14)),
7p13 (SUGCT, rs17688601, OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.92, P = 1.41 × 10(-8)) and
3q29 (TP63, rs9854771, OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85-0.93, P = 2.35 × 10(-8)). We
detected significant association at 2p13.3 (ETAA1, rs1486134, OR = 1.14, 95% CI =
1.09-1.19, P = 3.36 × 10(-9)), a region with previous suggestive evidence in Han 
Chinese. We replicated previously reported associations at 9q34.2 (ABO), 13q22.1 
(KLF5), 5p15.33 (TERT and CLPTM1), 13q12.2 (PDX1), 1q32.1 (NR5A2), 7q32.3
(LINC-PINT), 16q23.1 (BCAR1) and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3). Our study identifies new loci
associated with pancreatic cancer risk.

MicroRNAs, whose transcription is regulated by members of the tumor protein p53
family, modulate the expression of numerous metabolic enzymes, significantly
altering tumor cell response to chemotherapeutic treatments. The role for
<U+0394>Np63a-regulated microRNAs in regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
autophagy in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells upon cisplatin exposure has been
reported. The current study indicated that the selected microRNA targets
differentially regulated by <U+0394>Np63a in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant
SCC cells could alter the expression of a few metabolic enzymes, thereby
potentially contributing to the metabolic changes in SCC cells upon cisplatin
exposure. Finally, the modulation of specific targets (e.g., SREBF2, AKT2, G6PD, 
CPS1, FADS1, and ETNK1) using a combination of microRNA mimics and siRNA
silencing has shown that a suppression of these metabolic factors/ enzymes could 
confer a sensitivity of SCC cells to cisplatin. Thus, the <U+0394> Np63a-regulated
microRNAs were found to regulate the levels of several metabolic factors and
enzymes, thereby potentially contributing to the response of larynx and
tongue-derived SCC cells to platinum chemotherapy.

Cell invasion and adhesion play an important role in cancer metastasis and are
orchestrated by a complicated network of transcription factors including p63.
Here, we show that a member of the tripartite motif protein family, TRIM29, is
required for regulation of the p63-mediated pathway in cervical cancer cells.
TRIM29 knockdown alters the adhesion and invasion activities of cervical cancer
cells. TRIM29 knockdown and overexpression cause a significant decrease and
increase of TAp63a expression, respectively. TRIM29 knockdown alters the
expression pattern of integrins and increases ZEB1 expression. TRIM29 is required
for suppression of an increase in the adhesion activity of cells by TAp63a. These
findings suggest that TRIM29 regulates the p63-mediated pathway and the behavior 
of cervical cancer cells.

1a, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), a secosteriod that has been explored as an
anti-cancer agent, was also shown to promote cell survival. Its receptor, the
Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), is a direct target of the proto-oncogene <U+0394>Np63a, which 
is overexpressed in non-melanoma skin cancers. The interconnection between
VDR/VD3 signaling and <U+0394>Np63a, led us to examine whether VDR/VD3 signaling
promotes keratinocyte proliferation by regulating <U+0394>Np63a levels. Our data
demonstrate that VDR regulates <U+0394>Np63a expression at both the transcript and
protein level. Interestingly, although low doses of VD3 led to an increase in
<U+0394>Np63a protein levels and keratinocyte proliferation, high doses of VD3 failed to
increase <U+0394>Np63a protein levels and resulted in reduced proliferation. Increased
expression of <U+0394>Np63a by low dose VD3 was shown to be dependent on VDR and
critical for the proliferative effects of VD3. VD3-mediated increases in <U+0394>Np63a
protein levels occur via activation of both p38 MAPK and Akt kinases. Finally,
analysis of samples from patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell 
carcinoma and precursors to invasive SCC demonstrated a significant correlation
between p63 and VDR levels when compared with healthy normal skin control
samples. Delineation of the mechanisms by which VD3 exerts its effect on <U+0394>Np63a
and cell proliferation is critical for determining the future of VD3 in cancer
therapies.

PURPOSE: Cultured human limbal epithelial cells (HLECs) have shown promise in the
treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency but little is known about their
survival, behavior, and long-term fate after transplantation. The aim of this
research was to evaluate, in vitro, quantum dot (Qdot) technology as a tool for
tracking transplanted HLECs.
METHODS: In vitro cultured HLECs were labeled with Qdot nanocrystals. Toxicity
was assessed using live-dead assays. The effect on HLEC function was assessed
using colony-forming efficiency assays and expression of CK3, P63alpha, and
ABCG2. Sheets of cultured HLECs labeled with Qdot nanocrystals were transplanted 
onto decellularized human corneoscleral rims in an organ culture model and
observed to investigate the behavior of transplanted cells.
RESULTS: Quantum dot labeling had no detrimental effect on HLEC viability or
function in vitro. Proliferation resulted in a gradual reduction in Qdot signal
but sufficient signal was present to allow tracking of cells through multiple
generations. Cells labeled with Qdots could be reliably detected and observed
using confocal microscopy for at least 2 weeks after transplantation in our organ
culture model. In addition, it was possible to label and observe epithelial cells
in intact human corneas by using the Rostock corneal module adapted for use with 
the Heidelberg HRA.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that Qdots combined with existing clinical
equipment could be used to track HLEC for up to 2 weeks after transplantation;
however, our model does not permit the assessment of cell labeling beyond 2
weeks. Further characterization in in vivo models are required.

Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) have different clinical presentations, morphologies,
treatments, and prognoses. Recent studies suggested that fundamental genetic
alterations related to carcinogenesis of each tumor type may be different. In
this study, we investigated the genomic alterations of 47 primary NSCLC samples
(22 ACs and 25 SCCs) as well as the corresponding normal tissue using array
comparative genomic hybridization. Frequent copy number alterations (CNAs), which
were identified in more than 68% of all of the cases, were evaluated in each
subtype (SCC and AC), and a CNA signature was established. Among these CNAs, 37
genes from the SCCs and 15 genes from the ACs were located in a region of gain,
and 4 genes from the SCCs and 13 genes from the ACs were located in a region of
loss. The most frequent gain was located on 3q26-29 including the gene TP63 in
SCCs and 7q11.23 and 7q36.3 in ACs. Moreover, we identified 3 genetically
distinct groups (group I [16 SCC] with CNA signature of SCC; group II [7 SCC + 8 
AC], which has a genetically distinctive CNA signature from SCC and AC; and group
III [2 SCC + 14 AC] with CNA signature of AC) by gene clustering extracted from
CNAs, which are associated with a prognosis. The present study contributed to the
molecular characterization of AC and SCC of NSCLC and showed a subtype of tumor
that has a unique genetic CNA signature. However, further study about the
significance of these 3 distinct groups and their usefulness as a diagnostic
marker of identified CNAs is necessary.

Transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ binding domain (TAZ) is a WW
domain-containing transcriptional co-activator and a core component of an
emerging Hippo signaling pathway that regulates organ size, tumorigenesis,
metastasis, and drug resistance. TAZ regulates these biological functions by
up-regulating downstream cellular genes through transactivation of transcription 
factors such as TEAD and TTF1. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying 
TAZ-induced tumorigenesis, we have recently performed a gene expression profile
analysis by overexpressing TAZ in mammary cells. In addition to the
TAZ-up-regulated genes that were confirmed in our previous studies, we identified
a large number of cellular genes that were down-regulated by TAZ. In this study, 
we have confirmed these down-regulated genes (including cytokines, chemokines,
and p53 gene family members) as bona fide downstream transcriptional targets of
TAZ. By using human breast and lung epithelial cells, we have further
characterized <U+0394>Np63, a p53 gene family member, and shown that TAZ suppresses
<U+0394>Np63 mRNA, protein expression, and promoter activity through interaction with
the transcription factor TEAD. We also show that TEAD can inhibit <U+0394>Np63 promoter 
activity and that TAZ can directly interact with <U+0394>Np63 promoter-containing TEAD
binding sites. Finally, we provide functional evidence that down-regulation of
<U+0394>Np63 by TAZ may play a role in regulating cell migration. Altogether, this study
provides novel evidence that the Hippo component TAZ can function as a
co-repressor and regulate biological functions by negatively regulating
downstream cellular genes.

Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation can be used to identify
transcriptional enhancers, but no systematic approach has been developed for
genome-wide identification and analysis of enhancers based on DNA methylation. We
describe ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), an
R-based tool that uses DNA methylation to identify enhancers and correlates
enhancer state with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional
targets. Transcription factor motif analysis of enhancers is coupled with
expression analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators. Using 
ELMER, we investigated more than 2,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome
Atlas. We identified networks regulated by known cancer drivers such as GATA3 and
FOXA1 (breast cancer), SOX17 and FOXA2 (endometrial cancer), and NFE2L2, SOX2,
and TP63 (squamous cell lung cancer). We also identified novel networks with
prognostic associations, including RUNX1 in kidney cancer. We propose ELMER as a 
powerful new paradigm for understanding the cis-regulatory interface between
cancer-associated transcription factors and their functional target genes.

CONTEXT: Metaplastic carcinomas arising in association with benign sclerosing
lesions (BSLs) are rare malignancies in which a neoplastic spindle cell
proliferation can be recognized extending beyond the boundaries of the complex
sclerosing lesion or papilloma. However, in cases in which the metaplastic
carcinoma is of the low-grade fibromatosis-like type or is a low-grade
adenosquamous carcinoma, distinction from the background BSL can be a significant
challenge. Cytokeratin (CK) and/or p63 immunostains are helpful in confirming the
diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma, but the expression patterns of these markers 
in the stromal cells of BSLs have not been well characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the expression patterns of CKs and p63 in BSLs.
DESIGN: We evaluated the spindle cell component of 55 BSLs using CK 5/6, CK 903, 
CK MNF116, and p63.
RESULTS: A total of 45 cases (81%) showed no staining for CKs or p63 in benign
stromal cells. CK 5/6, CK 903, and p63 were positive in one case each. CK MNF116 
stained spindle cells within 10 BSLs. No cases showed spindle cell reactivity for
all 4 markers. Positive cases demonstrated very focal, weak staining of spindle
cells; only 1 case showed focal, moderate CK staining. Spindle cell positivity
was not associated with lesion type, growth pattern, spindle cell atypia, or
mitoses.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that although the presence or absence of
expression of CK 5/6, CK 903, and p63 may be useful to distinguish BSL from
metaplastic carcinomas arising in this setting, CK MNF116 positivity may be a
diagnostic pitfall.

Ectrodactyly - ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome (OMIM
604292) is a rare disorder determined by mutations in the TP63 gene. Most cases
of EEC syndrome are associated to mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD)
region of the p63 protein. Here we report on a three-generation Brazilian family 
with three individuals (mother, son and grandfather) affected by EEC syndrome,
determined by a novel mutation c.1037C > G (p.Ala346Gly). The disorder in this
family exhibits a broad spectrum of phenotypes: two individuals were personally
examined, one presenting the complete constellation of EEC syndrome
manifestations and the other presenting an intermediate phenotype; the third
affected, a deceased individual not examined personally and referred to by his
daughter, exhibited only the split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM). Our findings
contribute to elucidate the complex phenotype-genotype correlations in EEC
syndrome and other related TP63-mutation syndromes. The possibility of the
mutation c.1037C > G being related both to acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth
(ADULT) syndrome and SHFM is also raised by the findings here reported.

OBJECTIVES: Adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung may harbor EGFR- or KRAS-mutations, 
which are relevant for treatment decisions. There is no consensus on the
percentages of EGFR- and KRAS-mutations that are allowed to be missed by a
diagnostic algorithm, although a percentage of less than 1% for EGFR-mutations
has been suggested. The current guidelines do not advise to perform EGFR-mutation
analysis in unequivocal squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). For KRAS-mutations no
threshold for missing cases is suggested yet. To improve segregation between ADC 
and SqCC in small samples, the classification of lung cancer was updated in 2011,
adding immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p63 and TTF-1 to the diagnostic algorithm. 
In this study we examined how many cases with an EGFR- or KRAS-mutation in our
database would have been missed, if the current guideline for selecting cases for
mutation analysis would have been applied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From an institutional lung cancer database of specimens
analyzed for EGFR- and KRAS-mutations (n=816), cases harboring a mutation without
being treated prior with an EGFR-TKI were selected (n=336). Corresponding
original histological diagnoses and IHC for TTF-1, p63 and PAS-D were collected. 
Cases with SqCC on HE or with an IHC pattern favoring SqCC were reassessed
according to the criteria of the 2011-classification.
RESULTS: From the 336 cases 70% had a KRAS-mutation and 30% an EGFR-mutation. The
number of cases with SqCC on HE and/or an IHC-profile favoring SqCC was 12. After
the reassessment six specimens (1.8%) would not have been tested for
EGFR-/KRAS-mutations, if the current diagnostic algorithm had been used: 2.0% of 
EGFR-mutations and 1.7% KRAS-mutations. All six cases were NSCLC with an
IHC-profile favoring SqCC.
CONCLUSION: Most NSCLC-cases with EGFR- and KRAS-mutations are selected by the
current diagnostic algorithm. As a small but relevant fraction is missed, there
is room for improvement.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the expression of hMLH1, p63, and MDM2 in Gorlin
syndrome-associated keratocystic odontogenic tumors (SKOTs) and nonsyndromic
keratocystic odontogenic tumors (NSKOTs).
STUDY DESIGN: Seventeen primary NSKOTs, 17 SKOTs, and 8 recurrent NSKOTs were
analyzed by using immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: No significant differences in the hMLH1, p63, or MDM2 labeling indices
were observed between groups (P = .398; P = .232; P = .426, respectively). Higher
hMLH1 immunoexpression was found in the basal layer of primary NSKOTs. Most KOTs 
exhibited p63 immunoexpression in the upper layers of the epithelium. MDM2
immunoexpression was observed in the upper epithelial layers of SKOTs and
recurrent NSKOTs.
CONCLUSION: It was not possible to correlate the immunoexpression of hMLH1, p63, 
and MDM2 in SKOTs and primary and recurrent NSKOTs, suggesting that these
proteins exert independent effects on the development of these groups of tumors.

Expression of the protein deacetylase SIRT1 is associated with either poor or
favorable prognosis in cancer patients, depending on the cancer type. In head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), SIRT1 expression is associated with
favorable prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the
tumor-suppressive function of SIRT1 in HNSCC is unknown. SIRT1 promotes
differentiation in epithelial cells; therefore, we investigated whether SIRT1
promotes differentiation in HNSCC cells by studying the correlations between the 
expression of SIRT1 and several genes implicated in stemness or differentiation
in HNSCC-derived cell lines. Our results suggest that SIRT1 does not contribute
to differentiation in HNSCC cells. RNA interference-mediated reduction of SIRT1
revealed that SIRT1 supports the expression of TAp63, which has been implicated
in tumor suppression, in addition to epithelial differentiation. A positive
correlation was observed between SIRT1 and TAp63 expression in HNSCC tissues, as 
determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
analysis of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy samples.
Together, these results suggest that although SIRT1 does not regulate
differentiation of HNSCC cells, it functions as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC by
supporting the transcription of tumor-suppressive TAp63. This finding supports
the notion that SIRT1-activating drugs could be useful for the treatment of
HNSCC.

OBJECTIVE: It is now important to distinguish between adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma of the lung because of target-specific treatments. Our study aimed
to study the efficiency of Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1), cytokeratin
5/6 (CK5/6) and p63 in distinguishing between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma and to study the contribution of these markers to the diagnosis in
non-small cell lung cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Immunohistochemically, TTF-1, CK 5/6 and p63 were used in 72
cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 19 cases of adenocarcinoma, and 29 cases of
non-small cell lung cancer whose final diagnosis was decided with the subsequent 
resection material. The specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative
predictive value were calculated for each marker.
RESULTS: TTF-1 positivity was seen in none of the 72 squamous cell carcinomas but
in all of 19 adenocarcinoma cases. CK5/6 negativity was seen in all cases of
adenocarcinoma and in two cases of squamous cell carcinoma. p63 was positive in
all squamous cell carcinomas and in 4 adenocarcinomas. Cytokeratin 5/6, p63
positivity and TTF-1 negativity were observed in 17 non-small cell lung cancers
whose final diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma. None of the 12 non-small cell 
lung cancers whose final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma exhibited positive staining
for CK5/6. However, p63 staining was not seen in the biopsy but was focal in the 
surgical specimen in one case. All the 12 non-small cell lung cancers whose
certain diagnosis was adenocarcinoma were positive for TTF-1. TTF-1, CK 5/6 and
p63 seem to be useful for differentiating adenocarcinoma from squamous cell
carcinoma with 100% specificity, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, 97%
sensitivity and 87% specificity, and 100% sensitivity, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that TTF-1 is a reliable marker for subtyping lung
cancer. Different staining patterns can be seen with CK5/6 and p63; however, if
they are used together with TTF-1 and interpreted correctly, they can be of help 
for the final diagnosis even in cases in which the morphology is unclear.

Alopecia-neurological defects-endocrinopathy (ANE) syndrome is a rare inherited
hair disorder, which was shown to result from decreased expression of the
RNA-binding motif protein 28 (RBM28). In this study, we attempted to delineate
the role of RBM28 in hair biology. First, we sought to obtain evidence for the
direct involvement of RBM28 in hair growth. When RBM28 was downregulated in human
hair follicle (HF) organ cultures, we observed catagen induction and HF growth
arrest, indicating that RBM28 is necessary for normal hair growth. We also aimed 
at identifying molecular targets of RBM28. Given that an RBM28 homologue was
recently found to regulate miRNA biogenesis in C. elegans and given the known
pivotal importance of miRNAs for proper hair follicle development, we studied
global miRNA expression profile in cells knocked down for RBM28. This analysis
revealed that RBM28 controls the expression of miR-203. miR-203 was found to
regulate in turn TP63, encoding the transcription factor p63, which is critical
for hair morphogenesis. In conclusion, RBM28 contributes to HF growth regulation 
through modulation of miR-203 and p63 activity.

This study shows that specific microRNAs differentially regulated by <U+0394>Np63a in
cisplatin-sensitive and resistant squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) cells of larynx
and tongue affect the expression of members of the necroptotic pathway CYLD,
RIPK1, and MLKL. Different degrees of protein interaction between necroptotic
signaling intermediates were also observed in SCC cells sensitive or resistant to
cisplatin. Modulation of RIPK1 with miR-101-3p mimic or inhibitor, as well as
with siRNA, or chemical inhibitors was shown to affect sensitivity of SCC cells
to cisplatin. This is the first report showing the modulatory effect of
<U+0394>Np63a-responsive microRNAs on the specific members of necroptotic pathway in SCC
tumor cells variably responding to platinum chemotherapy.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with complex genetics and
different degrees of prevalence across ethnic populations. Here we present the
largest trans-ethnic genome-wide meta-analysis (GWMA) of psoriasis in 15,369
cases and 19,517 controls of Caucasian and Chinese ancestries. We identify four
novel associations at LOC144817, COG6, RUNX1 and TP63, as well as three novel
secondary associations within IFIH1 and IL12B. Fine-mapping analysis of MHC
region demonstrates an important role for all three HLA class I genes and a
complex and heterogeneous pattern of HLA associations between Caucasian and
Chinese populations. Further, trans-ethnic comparison suggests
population-specific effect or allelic heterogeneity for 11 loci. These
population-specific effects contribute significantly to the ethnic diversity of
psoriasis prevalence. This study not only provides novel biological insights into
the involvement of immune and keratinocyte development mechanism, but also
demonstrates a complex and heterogeneous genetic architecture of psoriasis
susceptibility across ethnic populations.

As a result of breast cancer screening programs, high-grade ductal carcinoma in
situ (DCIS) of the breast is diagnosed more often. Frequently, a DCIS diagnosis
can only be made using immunohistochemical stains to visualize the myoepithelial 
layer in order to assess microinvasion. Standard markers for myoepithelial cells 
are CK5/6 and p63. An isoform of the latter, <U+2206>Np63, is recognized by a recently
developed antibody, p40. Here, we compare the standard myoepithelial markers
CK5/6 and p63 with p40. We immunostained full sections of tissue samples of 35
high-grade DCIS and compared the staining pattern of CK5/6, p63 and p40 in tumour
tissue and in normal glands. Staining patterns of myoepithelial cells for p63 and
p40 were similar in terms of the percentage of stained nuclei. In all cases, p63 
was strongly expressed, while this was the case for p40 in 31 (89%) and
moderately in 4 (11%) cases. All but one case (97%) showed a similar percentage
of stained myoepithelial cells in comparing CK5/6 and p40 staining. CK5/6
expression was heterogeneous and strong/moderate/weak in 60, 34 and 6 %
respectively. Compared to surrounding normal glands, staining of myoepithelial
cells for all three markers in the neoplastic lesion was attenuated. In
high-grade DCIS, p40 staining is highly specific for myoepithelial cells. Its
staining pattern and intensity are equal to p63, which opens up its use for daily
practice. Staining with p40 is less heterogeneous than that for CK5/6.

The transcription factor p63 is required for skeletal formation, and is important
for the regulation of 1a,25(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) in human mesenchymal stem cells
(hMSC). Herein we report that TAp63<U+03B3> and <U+0394>Np63ß appear to be an integral part of 
the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC and are differentially regulated by the 
vitamin D3 metabolites 1a,25(OH)2D3 and 24R,25(OH)2D3. We compared the endogenous
expression of p63 isoforms (TA- and <U+0394>Np63) and splice variants (p63a, -ß, -<U+03B3>), in
naive hMSC and during osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC. TAp63a and -ß were
the predominant p63 variants in naive, proliferating hMSC. In contrast, under
osteoblastic differentiation conditions, expression of p63 changed from the
TAp63a and -ß to the TAp63<U+03B3> and <U+0394>Np63ß variants. Transient overexpression of the 
p63 variants demonstrated that TAp63ß, <U+0394>Np63ß, and <U+0394>Np63<U+03B3> increased alkaline
phosphatase activity and <U+0394>Np63a and -<U+03B3> increased the expression of mRNA for
osteocalcin and osterix. Our results support the hypothesis that TAp63a and -ß
promote a naive state in hMSC. Moreover, TAp63<U+03B3> is increased during and promotes 
early osteoblastic differentiation through the expression of pro-osteogenic
genes; VDR, Osterix, Runx2 and Osteopontin. <U+0394>Np63ß also appears to support
osteogenic maturation through increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment 
with 1a,25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of mRNA for <U+0394>Np63, while addition of
24R,25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of TA- and <U+0394>Np63<U+03B3> variants. These novel
findings demonstrate for the first time that p63 variants are differentially
expressed in naive hMSC (TAp63a,ß), are important during the osteoblastic
differentiation of hMSC (TAp63<U+03B3> and <U+0394>Np63ß), and are differentially regulated by 
the vitamin D3 metabolites, 1a,25(OH)2D3 and 24R,25(OH)2D3. The molecular nuances
and mechanisms of osteoblastic differentiation presented here will hopefully
improve our understanding of bone development, complications in bone repair (mal-
and non-union fractures), osteoporosis and possibly lead to new modalities of
treatment.

MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) have been recognized to regulate cancer initiation and
progression in carcinogenesis as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, but 
their role in hypopharyngeal cancer development is not clearly defined. To
determine whether miRNA-203 can promote tumor growth in human hypopharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma, we conducted experiments on the functional study of
miRNA-203 and identification of miRNA-203 regulated target genes in
hypopharyngeal cancer cells. We found that cell proliferation and cell
colony-forming increased more in the miRNA-203 up-regulated cancer cells than in 
the negative control cancer cells. Up-regulation of miRNA-203 accelerated cell
cycle progression in hypopharyngeal cancer cells. TP63 and B3GNT5 mRNAs were
identified and validated as targets of miRNA-203. However, transwell assay and
wound scratch assay showed that miRNA-203 did not involve in invasion and
metastasis in hypopharyngeal cancer cells. According to the results, we conclude 
that miRNA-203 can promote tumor growth in human hypopharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma. These results provide the convincing evidence for the first time that 
up-regulation of miRNA-203 contributes to the malignancy of hypopharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma, possibly through down-regulating TP63 and B3GNT5.

Chronic venous leg ulcers (VLU), especially long-lasting non-healing ulcers, are 
among the risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Malignant
transformation of a VLU is a rare finding and the relative risk of carcinomatous 
transformation is quite low (about 5.8). SCC arising in the context of a VLU has 
a particularly aggressive behavior. A 76-year-old male patient with no relevant
medical familial history, with chronic venous insufficiency CEAP C6 for 10 years 
[recurrent leg ulcers with favorable outcome (healing) after specific local and
systemic treatment], showing for about three years one ulcerated lesion located
on the anterior upper third of the right calf non-responsive to specific
treatment, which subsequently increased their size and merged. Biopsy sample was 
taken. Histopathology showed epidermal acanthosis, papillomatosis, intense
parakeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, dysplasia and moderately
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with areas of acantholysis.
Immunohistochemistry (Ki67, EMA, cytokeratin 34ßE12 and p63) was performed and
all types of immunostaining were moderately to intense positive. Above-knee leg
amputation and specific oncologic treatment were proposed as possible curative
solutions but the patient refused. Ten months after diagnosis and discharge form 
the Department of Dermatology, the patient died. Patients with chronic venous leg
ulcers and clinically suspicious lesions should be evaluated for malignant
transformation of the venous lesion. When diagnosed, malignancy complicating a
chronic venous leg ulcer requires a resolute treatment as it may be fatal.

AIMS: To determine the use of p40 and laminin 332 (LN332) immunostains for
diagnosing metaplastic carcinoma by studying the expression of these and other
routine markers in spindle cell metaplastic carcinomas and other malignant
spindle cell tumours.
METHODS: We identified cases of spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma (n=36) and
other atypical/malignant spindle cell tumours, including 20 phyllodes tumours (14
borderline, six malignant) and 23 spindle cell sarcomas (three primary to
breast). Immunohistochemical staining was performed for p40 and two LN332 chains,
ß3 (kalinin B1) and <U+03B3>2 (lamC2). The expression of these markers was compared with
p63 and cytokeratins.
RESULTS: p40 and p63 expression was seen in 21 of 36 (58.3%) and 33 of 36 (91.7%)
metaplastic carcinomas, respectively. No phyllodes tumours showed stromal
expression of p40 or p63. One of 23 (4.3%) sarcomas showed focal weak p63
staining. LamC2 and kalinin B1 expression was seen in 28 of 36 (77.8%) and 26 of 
36 (72.2%) metaplastic carcinomas, respectively. LamC2 and kalinin B1 each showed
positive stromal cell expression in two of 20 (10%) phyllodes tumours. No
sarcomas showed staining with lamC2. Kalinin B1 staining was seen in 17 of 23
(73.9%) sarcomas, including two of three primary breast sarcomas. Cytokeratin
expression was seen in 32 of 36 (88.9%) metaplastic carcinomas and diffuse
staining was most often seen in 34ßE12 and CK5.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of relatively novel markers p40 and LN332 was
found to be less than that of routinely used markers (p63 and cytokeratins). p40 
proved to be a specific marker but lacked the sensitivity of p63, while LN332
showed staining in a significant proportion of phyllodes tumours and sarcomas.

Recent next-generation sequencing studies have generated a comprehensive overview
of the genomic landscape of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. This
review summarizes these findings to provide insight into the tumor biology of
these cancers and potential therapeutic opportunities for HPV-driven
malignancies. In addition to the tumorigenic properties of the HPV oncoproteins, 
integration of HPV DNA into the host genome is suggested to be a driver of the
neoplastic process. Integration may confer a growth and survival advantage via
enhanced expression of viral oncoproteins, alteration of critical cellular genes,
and changes in global promoter methylation and transcription. Alteration of
cellular genes may lead to loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, enhanced
oncogene expression, loss of function of DNA repair genes, or other vital
cellular functions. Recurrent integrations in RAD51B, NR4A2, and TP63, leading to
aberrant forms of these proteins, are observed in both HPV-positive head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and cervical carcinoma. Additional genomic
alterations, independent of integration events, include recurrent PIK3CA
mutations (and aberrations in other members of the PI3K pathway), alterations in 
receptor tyrosine kinases (primarily FGFR2 and FGFR3 in HPV-positive HNSCC, and
ERBB2 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma), and genes in pathways related to
squamous cell differentiation and immune responses. A number of the alterations
identified are potentially targetable, which may lead to advances in the
treatment of HPV-associated cancers.

OBJECTIVE: Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT) exhibits high risk 
for recurrence and regional metastasis even after surgical resection. We assessed
the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of a group of functionally
related biomarkers.
STUDY DESIGN: We used a tissue microarray consisting of SCCOT from 32 patients
for this study. These patients were treated at the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center from 1995 to 2008. Biomarker expression levels were
examined by immunohistochemistry and graded semiquantitatively to determine their
prognostic significance.
RESULTS: CD147 and Tp63 expressions were significantly associated with a higher T
stage and Ki-67 labeling index, as well as a shorter overall survival (OS) rate. 
Expression of Tp63 associated positively with poorly differentiated histology.
There was significant association of Tp63 with the expression levels of CD147 and
Glut-1. Glut-1 overexpression was marginally associated with a higher T stage.
There was no prognostic significance of CD44 v6 expression in SCCOT.
CONCLUSION: SCCOT with CD147 overexpression in combination with high Ki-67
labeling index had poor OS. CD147 and Ki-67 overexpression is associated with
aggressive disease with poor prognosis in SCCOT.

The transcription factor p63 is a member of the p53 gene family that plays a
complex role in cancer due to its involvement in epithelial differentiation, cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. MicroRNAs are a class of small, non-coding RNAs with 
an important regulatory role in various cellular processes, as well as in the
development and progression of cancer. A number of microRNAs have been shown to
function as transcriptional targets of p63. Conversely, microRNAs also can
modulate the expression and activity of p63. However, the p63-microRNA regulatory
circuit has not been addressed in depth so far. Here, computational genomic
analysis was performed using miRtarBase, Targetscan, microRNA.ORG, DIANA-MICROT, 
RNA22-HSA and miRDB to analyze miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of p63. JASPAR (profile
score threshold 80%) and TFSEARCH datasets were used to search transcriptional
start sites for p53/p63 response elements. Remarkably, these data revealed 63
microRNAs that targeted p63. Furthermore, there were 39 microRNAs targeting p63
that were predicted to be regulated by p63. These analyses suggest a crosstalk
between p63 and microRNAs. Here, we discuss the crosstalk between p63 and the
microRNA network, and the role of their interactions in cancer.

The TGFß superfamily regulates a broad range of cellular processes, including
proliferation, cell-fate specification, differentiation, and migration. Molecular
mechanisms underlying this high degree of pleiotropy and cell-type specificity
are not well understood. The TGFß family is composed of two branches: (i) TGFßs, 
activins, and nodals, which signal through SMAD2/3, and (ii) bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMP), which signal through SMAD1/5/8. SMADs have weak DNA-binding
affinity and rely on coactivators and corepressors to specify their
transcriptional outputs. This report reveals that p53 and <U+0394>Np63a act as
transcriptional partners for SMAD proteins and thereby influence cellular
responses to TGFß and BMPs. Suppression of p53 or overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a
synergistically enhance BMP-induced transcription. Mechanistically, p53 and
<U+0394>Np63a physically interact with SMAD1/5/8 proteins and co-occupy the promoter
region of inhibitor of differentiation (ID2), a prosurvival BMP target gene.
Demonstrating further convergence of these pathways, TGFß-induced canonical BMP
regulated transcription in a <U+0394>Np63a- and p53-dependent manner. Furthermore,
bioinformatic analyses revealed that SMAD2/3 and <U+0394>Np63a coregulate a significant 
number of transcripts involved in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. Thus, p53 and <U+0394>Np63a are transcriptional partners for a subset of
TGFß- and BMP-regulated SMAD target genes in the mammary epithelium.
Collectively, these results establish an integrated gene network of SMADs, p53,
and <U+0394>Np63a that contribute to EMT and metastasis.IMPLICATIONS: This study
identifies aberrant BMP activation as a result of p53 mutation or <U+0394>Np63a
expression.

Periostin is a non-structural matricellular protein. Little is known about
periostin in human limbal stem cells (LSCs). This study was to explore the unique
expression pattern and functional role of periostin in maintaining the properties
of human LSCs. Fresh donor corneal tissues were used to make cryosections for
evaluation of periostin expression on ex vivo tissues. Primary human limbal
epithelial cells (HLECs) were generated from limbal explant culture. In vitro
culture models for proliferation and epithelial regeneration were performed to
explore functional role of periostin in LSCs. The mRNA expression was determined 
by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), and the
protein production and localization were detected by immunofluorescent staining
and Western blot analysis. Periostin protein was found to be exclusively
immunolocalized in the basal layer of human limbal epithelium. Periostin
localization was well matched with nuclear factor p63, but not with corneal
epithelial differentiation marker Keratin 3. Periostin transcripts was also
highly expressed in limbal than corneal epithelium. In primary HLECs, periostin
expression at mRNA and protein levels was significantly higher in 50% and 70%
confluent cultures at exponential growth stage than in 100% confluent cultures at
slow growth or quiescent condition. This expression pattern was similar to other 
stem/progenitor cell markers (p63, integrin ß1 and TCF4). Periostin expression at
transcripts, protein and immunoreactivity levels increased significantly during
epithelial regeneration in wound healing process, especially in 16-24 hours at
wound edge, which was accompanied by similar upregulation and activation of p63, 
integrin ß1 and TCF4. Our findings demonstrated that periostin is exclusively
produced by limbal basal epithelium and co-localized with p63, where limbal stem 
cells reside. Periostin promotes HLEC proliferation and regeneration with
accompanied activation of stem/progenitor cell markers p63, integrin ß1 and TCF4,
suggesting its novel role in maintaining the phenotype and functional properties 
of LSC.

BACKGROUND: The p53 protein family, comprising p53, p63 and p73, is primarily
involved in preserving genome integrity and preventing tumor onset, and also
affects a range of physiological processes. Signal-dependent modifications of its
members and of other pathway components provide cells with a sophisticated code
to transduce a variety of stress signaling into appropriate responses. TP53
mutations are highly frequent in cancer and lead to the expression of mutant p53 
proteins that are endowed with oncogenic activities and sensitive to stress
signaling.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: p53 family proteins have unique structural and functional
plasticity, and here we discuss the relevance of prolyl-isomerization to actively
shape these features.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The anti-proliferative functions of the p53 family are
carefully activated upon severe stress and this involves the interaction with
prolyl-isomerases. In particular, stress-induced stabilization of p53, activation
of its transcriptional control over arrest- and cell death-related target genes
and of its mitochondrial apoptotic function, as well as certain p63 and p73
functions, all require phosphorylation of specific S/T-P motifs and their
subsequent isomerization by the prolyl-isomerase Pin1. While these functions of
p53 counteract tumorigenesis, under some circumstances their activation by
prolyl-isomerases may have negative repercussions (e.g. tissue damage induced by 
anticancer therapies and ischemia-reperfusion, neurodegeneration). Moreover,
elevated Pin1 levels in tumor cells may transduce deregulated phosphorylation
signaling into activation of mutant p53 oncogenic functions.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The complex repertoire of biological outcomes induced by
p53 finds mechanistic explanations, at least in part, in the association between 
prolyl-isomerases and the p53 pathway. This article is part of a Special Issue
entitled Proline-directed foldases: Cell signaling catalysts and drug targets.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) typically lack somatic
oncogene-activating mutations and most of them contain p53 mutations. However,
the presence of p53 mutations in skin premalignant lesions suggests that these
represent early events during tumor progression and additional alterations may be
required for SCC development. SCC cells frequently express high levels of <U+0394>Np63a 
and Y-box binding 1 (YB-1 or YBX1) oncoproteins. Here, we show that knockdown of 
YB-1 in spontaneously immortalized HaCaT and non-metastatic SCC011 cells led to a
dramatic decrease of <U+0394>Np63a, cell detachment and death. In highly metastatic
SCC022 cells, instead, YB-1 silencing induces PI3K/AKT signaling hyperactivation 
which counteracts the effect of YB-1 depletion and promotes cell survival. In
summary, our results unveil a functional cross-talk between YB-1, <U+0394>Np63a and the 
PI3K/AKT pathway critically governing survival of squamous carcinoma cells.

The p53, p63, and p73 proteins belong to the p53 family of transcription factors,
which play key roles in tumor suppression. Although the transactivation domains
(TADs) of the p53 family are intrinsically disordered, these domains are commonly
involved in the regulatory interactions with mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). In
this study, we determined the solution structure of the p73TAD peptide in complex
with MDM2 using NMR spectroscopy and biophysically characterized the interactions
between the p53 family TAD peptides and MDM2. In combination with mutagenesis
data, the complex structures revealed remarkably close mimicry of the MDM2
recognition mechanism among the p53 family TADs. Upon binding with MDM2, the
intrinsically disordered p73TAD and p63TAD peptides adopt an amphipathic
a-helical conformation, which is similar to the conformation of p53TAD, although 
the a-helical content induced by MDM2 binding varies. With isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD) data, our biophysical
characterization showed that p73TAD resembles p53TAD more closely than p63TAD in 
terms of helical stability, MDM2 binding affinity, and phosphorylation effects on
MDM2 binding. Therefore, our structural information may be useful in establishing
alternative anticancer strategies that exploit the activation of the p73 pathway 
against human tumors bearing p53 mutations.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease characterized by chronic inflammation of
the pilosebaceous unit resulting from androgen-induced increased sebum
production, altered keratinization, inflammation and bacterial colonization of
hair follicles by propionibacterium acnes. Our previous genome-wide association
study on acne has identified two new susceptibility loci. To search for potential
gene-gene interactions and investigate the best-fit association models for the
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from these interacting genes, we
implemented logistic regression analysis in the combined sample of 2916 cases
with severe acne and 4716 controls. The most significant association evidence was
observed under an additive model for rs6896064 and under a dominant model the
rest of these SNP. Significant interactions between these SNP were observed in
this study: the SELL × MRPS36P2 (Padjusted = 4.15 × 10(-10)), TP63 × DDB2
(Padjusted = 7.62 × 10(-08)), DDB2 × CACNA1H (Padjusted = 1.89 × 10(-07)), ADAM19
× GNAI1 × CDH13 (Padjusted = 1.22 × 10(-04)) and ADAM19 × GABRG2 × GNAI2 × CDH13 
(Pad justed = 6.33 × 10(-05)). These results may contribute to our understanding 
of acne genetic etiology and account for the additional risk of certain patients.

Prediction of subsequent risks of breast carcinoma (BC) development in
intraductal papilloma (IDP) has remained controversial with the exception of
atypical papilloma (AP). The potential value of immunohistochemistry (IHC) of
cytokeratin 5/6 [CK5/6] and p63 have been proposed but its standardization has
also remained controversial. We studied 17 patients initially diagnosed as IDP or
AP who subsequently developed BC with 34 age-matched controls. We compared
histological features, results of IHC (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone
receptor [PR], human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2], p63, CK5/6,
Ki67), and ultrasound findings. Univariate conditional logistic regression
analysis revealed that the status of both CK5/6 and p63/CK5/6 were significantly 
associated with subsequent BC development (P < 0.05). BC development in CK5/6
positive patients was 17.9% and p63/CK5/6 double positive patients 8.6%,
respectively. Ultrasound evaluation was not significantly associated with any of 
the parameters examined and subsequent carcinoma development. Despite CK5/6
positivity, the subsequent incidence of BC development was nearly 20%. However
p63/CK5/6 double positive status could predict a significantly lower subsequent
carcinoma incidence, indicating a more accurate prognostic utility. Combining
p63/CK5/6 with histological findings could be easily applied and could predict
the subsequent BC development of the patients diagnosed as IDP at biopsy.

We previously carried out a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) on
lung cancer among never smokers in the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia
(FLCCA) (6,609 cases, 7,457 controls) that identified novel susceptibility loci
at 10q25.2, 6q22.2, and 6p21.32, and confirmed two previously identified loci at 
5p15.33 and 3q28. Household air pollution (HAP) attributed to solid fuel burning 
for heating and cooking, is the leading cause of the overall disease burden in
Southeast Asia, and is known to contain lung carcinogens. To evaluate the
gene-HAP interactions associated with lung cancer in loci independent of smoking,
we analyzed data from studies participating in FLCCA with fuel use information
available (n = 3; 1,731 cases; 1,349 controls). Coal use was associated with a
30% increased risk of lung cancer (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6). Among the five a
priori SNPs identified by our GWAS, two showed a significant interaction with
coal use (HLA Class II rs2395185, p = 0.02; TP63 rs4488809 (rs4600802), p =
0.04). The risk of lung cancer associated with coal exposure varied with the
respective alleles for these two SNPs. Our observations provide evidence that
genetic variation in HLA Class II and TP63 may modify the association between HAP
and lung cancer risk. The roles played in the cell cycle and inflammation
pathways by the proteins encoded by these two genes provide biological
plausibility for these interactions; however, additional replication studies are 
needed in other non-smoking populations.

BACKGROUND: The large airways of the lungs (trachea and bronchi) are lined with a
pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium, which is maintained by stem
cells/progenitors within the basal cell compartment. Alterations in basal cell
behavior can contribute to large airway diseases including squamous cell
carcinomas (SQCCs). Basal cells have traditionally been thought of as a uniform
population defined by basolateral position, cuboidal cell shape, and expression
of pan-basal cell lineage markers like KRT5 and TP63. While some evidence
suggests that basal cells are not all functionally equivalent, few
heterogeneously expressed markers have been identified to purify and study
subpopulations. In addition, few signaling pathways have been identified that
regulate their cell behavior. The goals of this work were to investigate tracheal
basal cell diversity and to identify new signaling pathways that regulate basal
cell behavior.
METHODS: We used flow cytometry (FACS) to profile cell surface marker expression 
at a single cell level in primary human tracheal basal cell cultures that
maintain stem cell/progenitor activity. FACS results were validated with tissue
staining, in silico comparisons with normal basal cell and lung cancer datasets, 
and an in vitro proliferation assay.
RESULTS: We identified 105 surface markers, with 47 markers identifying potential
subpopulations. These subpopulations generally fell into more (~<U+2009>> 13%) or less
abundant (~ < 6%) groups. Microarray gene expression profiling supported the
heterogeneous expression of these markers in the total population, and
immunostaining of large airway tissue suggested that some of these markers are
relevant in vivo. 24 markers were enriched in lung SQCCs relative to
adenocarcinomas, with four markers having prognostic significance in SQCCs. We
also identified 33 signaling receptors, including the MST1R/RON growth factor
receptor, whose ligand MST1/MSP was mitogenic for basal cells.
CONCLUSION: This work provides the largest description to date of molecular
diversity among human large airway basal cells. Furthermore, these markers can be
used to further study basal cell function in repair and disease, and may aid in
the classification and study of SQCCs.

Transcription factor p63 is a member of the p53 protein family. Due to the high
degree of structural similarity p53, p63, and p73 are known to have overlapping
functions relating to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and tumor transformation. 
Furthermore, p63 plays crucial role in epidermal tissue development and
differentiation. Pirh2 (product of RCHY1 gene) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase
modifying all three members of the p53 family resulting in their subsequent
proteasomal degradation. Our results demonstrate that p63, similar to p53, is
able to regulate expression levels of Pirh2. Importantly, Pirh2 expression is
activated only by transcriptionally active isoform of p63--TAp63, but not the
N-terminally truncated <U+0394>Np63.

Basal cells of benign prostate glands are typically p63 positive, whereas
malignant glands are usually p63 negative. A rare subset of prostatic
adenocarcinoma (PCa) demonstrates aberrant diffuse p63 expression but is negative
for high-molecular-weight cytokeratin. Strong p63 staining of the tumor cells can
obscure the loss of high-molecular-weight cytokeratin when using a cocktail of
basal cell markers and create a diagnostic pitfall. The p63 protein has 6 major
isoforms; of these, TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 (p40) are the best characterized N-terminal
variants. In an attempt to aid in the diagnosis of p63-positive PCas, we studied 
<U+0394>Np63 expression in tumors with aberrant p63. Immunohistochemistry was performed 
on 31 cores of aberrant p63-positive PCas from 24 patients and on a tissue
microarray containing 125 cores of conventional PCas from 40 radical
prostatectomy cases using a <U+0394>Np63-specific polyclonal (p40) antibody and a
TAp63-specific monoclonal antibody (p63, clone 4A4) that recognizes both TAp63
and <U+0394>Np63. Most of the aberrant p63-positive tumors showed diffuse positivity for
p40 (29/31 cores, 93.5%; 23/24 cases, 96%). All 40 conventional PCa (125 cores)
were negative for p40 and p63 in the tumor cells. In summary, p40 is expressed in
most p63-positive PCas but negative in p63-negative conventional PCas. From a
diagnostic perspective, the use of immunohistochemistry for <U+0394>Np63/p40 provides
only a small advantage over the more widely used p63 assays. Our 1 <U+0394>Np63-negative
p63-positive case may represent expression of the TAp63 isoform in the tumor.

Expression and clinical implications of P53, P63, and P73 protein in malignant
tumor of the parotid gland.

Yong M, Yang L, Suyila Q, Han W, Yuan H, Zhao C, Su X.

BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate the expression of P53, P63, and P73 proteins in
malignant parotid gland tumors and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues and the
association between the 3 proteins and their clinical characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 pairs of paraffin-embedded malignant parotid
gland tumors and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues were collected. We detected P53, 
P63, and P73 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was
performed by using the chi-square test.
RESULTS: P53, P63, and P73 protein expression in malignant parotid gland tumors
was higher than their expression in adjacent nonneoplastic tissue (P = 0.030,
0.001, and 0.001, respectively). Expression of P53, P63, and P73 proteins was not
associated with age, sex, or lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05). Expression of P53 
and P73 proteins, instead of the P63 protein, was correlated to the degree of
malignancy (P = 0.026 and 0.018, respectively). There was no significant
difference among the P53, P73, and P63 proteins in malignant parotid gland tumors
(P > 0.05). In the follow-up, only one patient died of colon cancer.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the P53, P63, and P73 proteins may play a
role in the development of malignant parotid gland tumors and provide data for
their diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate candidate genes that might function as
biomarkers to differentiate triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) among
patients, who received adjuvant chemotherapy after curative surgery. We tested
whether the results of a NanoString expression assay that targeted 250
prospectively selected genes and used mRNA extracted from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded would predict distant recurrence in patients with TNBC. The
levels of expression of seven genes were used in a prospectively defined
algorithm to allocate each patient to a risk group (low or high). NanoString
expression profiles were obtained for 203 tumor tissue blocks. Increased
expressions of the five genes (SMAD2, HRAS, KRT6A, TP63 and ETV6) and decreased
expression of the two genes (NFKB1 and MDM4) were associated favorable prognosis 
and were validated with cross-validation. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates
of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low- and high-risk groups according to
gene expression signature were 62% [95% confidence interval (CI), 48.6-78.9%] and
85% (95% CI, 79.2-90.7%), respectively. When adjusting for TNM stage, the distant
recurrence-free survival (DRFS)s in the low-risk group was significantly longer
than that in the high-risk group (p <0.001) for early stage (I and II) and
advanced stage (III) tumors. In a multivariate Cox regression model, the gene
expression signature provided significant predictive power jointly with the TNM
staging system. A seven-gene signature could be used as a prognostic model to
predict DRFS in patients with TNBC who received curative surgery followed by
adjuvant chemotherapy.

High risk (oncogenic) human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes cervical
cancer. Infections are common but most clear naturally. Persistent infection can 
progress to cancer. Pre-neoplastic disease (cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia/CIN) is classified by histology (CIN1-3) according to severity.
Cervical abnormalities are screened for by cytology and/or detection of high risk
HPV but both methods are imperfect for prediction of which women need treatment. 
There is a need to understand the host virus interactions that lead to different 
disease outcomes and to develop biomarker tests for accurate triage of infected
women. As cancer is increasingly presumed to develop from proliferative, tumour
initiating, cancer stem cells (CSCs), and as other oncogenic viruses induce stem 
cell associated gene expression, we evaluated whether presence of mRNA (detected 
by qRT-PCR) or proteins (detected by flow cytometry and antibody based proteomic 
microarray) from stem cell associated genes and/or increased cell proliferation
(detected by flow cytometry) could be detected in well-characterised, routinely
collected cervical samples from high risk HPV+ve women. Both cytology and
histology results were available for most samples with moderate to high grade
abnormality. We found that stem cell associated proteins including human
chorionic gonadotropin, the oncogene TP63 and the transcription factor SOX2 were 
upregulated in samples from women with CIN3 and that the stem cell related, cell 
surface, protein podocalyxin was detectable on cells in samples from a subset of 
women with CIN3. SOX2, TP63 and human gonadotrophin mRNAs were upregulated in
high grade disease. Immunohistochemistry showed that SOX2 and TP63 proteins
clearly delineated tumour cells in invasive squamous cervical cancer. Samples
from women with CIN3 showed increased proliferating cells. We believe that these 
markers may be of use to develop triage tests for women with high grade cervical 
abnormality to distinguish those who may progress to cancer from those who may be
treated more conservatively.

p63 and p73, the two other members of the p53 family, were identified almost 15
years ago. Here, we review their potential use for diagnosis, prognosis and
prediction of response to therapy in various cancers. The two genes show distinct
expression patterns in both normal and cancer tissues and each gene gives rise to
multiple protein isoforms with different activities, including those with
tumour-suppressor or oncogenic effects. Despite such complexity, some common
themes emerge; p63 is commonly overexpressed as the <U+0394>Np63 isoform and sometimes
associated with TP63 amplification, whereas p73 is often reduced (by methylation 
or gene loss), or there is an increase in the ratio of <U+0394>Np73 to TAp73. These
generalisations do not apply universally; TAp63 is overexpressed in
haematological malignancies, TP63 mis-sense mutations have been reported in
squamous cancers and TP63 translocations occur in lymphomas and some lung
adenocarcinomas. There are associations with disease prognosis and response to
specific therapies in individual cancer types for both p63 and p73, making their 
analysis of clinical relevance. We also discuss their utility for aiding in
differential diagnosis, which has been demonstrated for p63, but not yet for p73.
Throughout, we highlight the discrepant nature of many studies due to the
variable methodologies employed, the lack of systematic evaluation of isoforms
and the problems of poor antibody characterization and cross-reactions within the
p63/p73 family. Finally, we emphasize the value of recently developed
isoform-specific reagents that have clear advantages for the study of p63 and p73
experimentally and clinically.

AIM/BACKGROUND: To compare the effects of accelerated corneal collagen
cross-linking (ACXL) and corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) on ex vivo-cultured
limbal epithelial cells (LECs).
METHODS: Day 14 cultured LECs were either unexposed (control) or exposed to
different intensities of ultraviolet-A (UV-A) irradiance for different durations 
(3 mW for 30 min, 9 mW for 10 min, 18 mW for 5 min and 30 mW for 3 min) in the
presence and absence of riboflavin. These cells were further processed for
quantitative real-time PCR, vital staining, immunofluorescence staining and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) staining to evaluate the apoptotic
status. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student t test.
RESULTS: Vital staining showed a significantly higher (p=0.004) dead cell
population with 3 mW for 30 min when compared with 30 mW for 3 min exposure
(p=0.225). Quantitative PCR results revealed significantly reduced abcg2 and
<U+0394>np63 mRNA levels, while FACS analysis showed an increase in ABCG2-Annexin V
positive population in cells exposed to 3 mW for 30 mins. Neither reduction of
mRNA expression of abcg2 and <U+0394>np63 nor increase in FACS-stained ABCG2-Annexin V
positivity was detected in cells exposed to 30 mW for 3 min. Additionally,
enhanced caspase activity was detected with fluorochrome inhibitor of caspases
staining and mRNA expression of caspase 3 and 9 was upregulated in cells exposed 
to 3 mW for 30 min, but not at 30 mW for 3 min.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30 mW UV-A irradiation used in ACXL appears to be safe on
cultured LECs in comparison with 3 mW used in CXL.

In the epidermis, tight junction (TJ) structure is specifically located in the
stratum granulosum, where the expression of <U+0394>Np63, a p53 family transcription
factor, is attenuated. Since the relationship between <U+0394>Np63 and barrier function 
has not been fully uncovered, we assessed expression profiles of TJ proteins in
skin tissues and cultured keratinocytes. The results showed that expression of
<U+0394>Np63 and that of claudin-4 were inversely correlated in healthy human epidermis.
In vitro studies using HaCaT keratinocytes revealed functional relevance of <U+0394>Np63
and claudin-4. Curiously, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 ligand, which is known to be
liberated from damaged cells, suppressed <U+0394>Np63 expression and concomitantly
upregulated claudin-4 expression in primary keratinocytes. More interestingly, a 
broad expression pattern of claudin-4 was found in the epidermis of atopic
dermatitis (AD), a barrier defect disorder, which contains <U+0394>Np63-lacking
keratinocytes as we reported previously. Therefore, upregulation of claudin-4
expression regulated by <U+0394>Np63 might be associated with complementary or repair
responses of damaged keratinocytes with AD.

PURPOSE: Several risk factors have been claimed to predict the progression of
clinically high grade T1 bladder tumors. However, these factors are not specific 
enough to define which patients should be treated immediately with radical
cystectomy. Therefore, it is critical to identify molecular markers that can help
provide individualized, risk stratified decision making. Our main goal was to
evaluate the role of total p63, p53 and <U+0394>Np63 expression in cases of clinically
high grade T1 bladder cancer progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total p63, p53 and <U+0394>Np63 expression was analyzed by
immunohistochemistry in 134 clinically high grade T1 tumors. We assessed clinical
progression to muscle invasive disease or radical cystectomy as a patient outcome
end point. Survival analysis was done for recurrence-free, progression-free,
disease specific and overall survival.
RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (98.5%) underwent repeat transurethral
resection. Cases of early progression (less than 3 months) were excluded from
study to avoid under staging. Of the tumors 90 (67.2%) showed <U+0394>Np63 expression
loss. During a median followup of 62.1 months 19 patients (14.2%) progressed to
muscle invasive disease. The progression rate was 21.1% in patients with tumors
characterized by <U+0394>Np63 loss but no progression was observed in those with tumors 
with <U+0394>Np63 expression (p <0.001). There was no difference in the number of
patients who underwent repeat transurethral resection, had associated carcinoma
in situ, showed lymphovascular invasion or received followup intravesical
bacillus Calmette-Guérin courses.
CONCLUSIONS: <U+0394>Np63 expression is a favorable prognostic factor in clinically high
grade T1 bladder cancer. This marker identifies patients at low risk for
progression who could benefit from conservative therapy with transurethral
bladder tumor resection and bacillus Calmette-Guérin, avoiding over treatment
with immediate radical cystectomy.

BACKGROUND: Conventional karyotyping (550 bands resolution) is able to identify
chromosomal aberrations >5-10 Mb, which represent a known cause of intellectual
disability/developmental delay (ID/DD) and/or multiple congenital anomalies
(MCA). Array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array-CGH) has increased the
diagnostic yield of 15-20%.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 700 ID/DD cases with or without MCA, including 15
prenatal diagnoses, we identified a subgroup of seven patients with a normal
karyotype and a large complex rearrangement detected by array-CGH (at least 6,
and up to 18 Mb). FISH analysis could be performed on six cases and showed that
rearrangements were translocation derivatives, indistinguishable from a normal
karyotype as they involved a similar band pattern and size. Five were inherited
from a parent with a balanced translocation, whereas two were apparently de novo.
Genes spanning the rearrangements could be associated with some phenotypic
features in three cases (case 3: DOCK8; case 4: GATA3, AKR1C4; case 6: AS/PWS
deletion, CHRNA7), and in two, likely disease genes were present (case 5: NR2F2, 
TP63, IGF1R; case 7: CDON). Three of our cases were prenatal diagnoses with an
apparently normal karyotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Large complex rearrangements of up to 18 Mb, involving chromosomal
regions with similar size and band appearance may be overlooked by conventional
karyotyping. Array-CGH allows a precise chromosomal diagnosis and recurrence risk
definition, further confirming this analysis as a first tier approach to clarify 
molecular bases of ID/DD and/or MCA. In prenatal tests, array-CGH is confirmed as
an important tool to avoid false negative results due to karyotype intrinsic
limit of detection.

BACKGROUND: The Transcription Factor (TF) p63 is a master regulator of epidermal 
development and differentiation as evident from the remarkable skin phenotype of 
p63 mouse knockouts. Furthermore, ectopic expression of p63 alone is sufficient
to convert simple epithelium into stratified epithelial tissues in vivo and p63
is required for efficient transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into keratinocytes.
However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of p63 function, in
particular how it selects its target sites in the genome. p63, which acts both as
an activator and repressor of transcription, recognizes a canonical binding motif
that occurs over 1 million times in the human genome. But, in human keratinocytes
less than 12,000 of these sites are bound in vivo suggesting that underlying
chromatin architecture and cooperating TFs mediate p63-genome interactions.
RESULTS: We find that the chromatin architecture at p63-bound targets possess
distinctive features and can be used to categorize p63 targets into proximal
promoters (1%), enhancers (59%) and repressed or inactive (40%) regulatory
elements. Our analysis shows that the chromatin modifications H3K4me1, H3K27me3, 
along with overall chromatin accessibility status can accurately predict bonafide
p63-bound sites without a priori DNA sequence information. Interestingly, however
there exists a qualitative correlation between the p63 binding motif and
accessibility and H3K4me1 levels. Furthermore, we use a comprehensive in silico
approach that leverages ENCODE data to identify several known TFs such as AP1,
AP2 and novel TFs (RFX5 for e.g.) that can potentially cooperate with p63 to
modulate its myriad biological functions in keratinocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that p63 bound genomic locations in keratinocytes
are accessible, marked by active histone modifications, and co-targeted by other 
developmentally important transcriptional regulators. Collectively, our results
suggest that p63 might actively remodel and/or influence chromatin dynamics at
its target sites and in the process dictate its own DNA binding and possibly that
of adjacent TFs.

TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses
tumours in vivo in mice (TP53 and Tp53 are also known as p53). This strategy has 
proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we examine an alternative
strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, Tp63 and Tp73 (also known as p63
and p73, respectively). The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing (TA) isoforms
of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, whereas the <U+0394>N
isoforms (lacking the acidic transactivation domain) of p63 and p73 are
frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative
fashion against p53, TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive
functions. The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that
promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy, thus a clear
understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with
alterations in the p53 pathway. Here we show that deletion of the <U+0394>N isoforms of 
p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient
tumours through upregulation of IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a
37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the ß cells of the pancreas. We
found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin
functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor activity modifying
protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and
apoptosis. Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to 
treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient
thymic lymphomas, representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers.

Despite overwhelming evidence that transcriptional activation by TP53 is critical
for its tumor suppressive activity, the mechanisms by which TP53 engages the
genome in the context of chromatin to activate transcription are not well
understood. Using a compendium of novel and existing genome-wide data sets, we
examined the relationship between TP53 binding and the dynamics of the local
chromatin environment. Our analysis revealed three distinct categories of TP53
binding events that differ based on the dynamics of the local chromatin
environment. The first class of TP53 binding events occurs near transcriptional
start sites (TSS) and is defined by previously characterized promoter-associated 
chromatin modifications. The second class comprises a large cohort of
preestablished, promoter-distal enhancer elements that demonstrates dynamic
histone acetylation and transcription upon TP53 binding. The third class of TP53 
binding sites is devoid of classic chromatin modifications and, remarkably, fall 
within regions of inaccessible chromatin, suggesting that TP53 has intrinsic
pioneer factor activity and binds within structurally inaccessible regions of
chromatin. Intriguingly, these inaccessible TP53 binding sites feature several
enhancer-like properties in cell types within the epithelial lineage, indicating 
that TP53 binding events include a group of "proto-enhancers" that become active 
enhancers given the appropriate cellular context. These data indicate that TP53, 
along with TP63, may act as pioneer factors to specify epithelial enhancers.
Further, these findings suggest that rather than following a global cell-type
invariant stress response program, TP53 may tune its response based on the
lineage-specific epigenomic landscape.

Carriers of the balanced translocation t(11;22), the most common reciprocal
translocation in humans, are at high risk of creating gametes with unbalanced
translocation, leading to repeated miscarriages. Current research models for
studying translocated embryos and the biological basis for their implantation
failure are limited. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs) carrying the unbalanced chromosomal translocation
t(11;22) can provide an explanation for repeated miscarriages of unbalanced
translocated embryos. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and karyotype analysis
were performed to analyze the t(11;22) in embryos during PGD and in the derived
hESC line. The hESC line was characterized by RT-PCR and FACS analysis for
pluripotent markers. Directed differentiation to trophoblasts was carried out by 
bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Trophoblast development was analyzed by
measuring ß-hCG secretion, by ß-hCG immunostaining and by gene expression of
trophoblastic markers. We derived the first hESC line carrying unbalanced
t(11;22), which showed the typical morphological and molecular characteristics of
a hESC line. Control hESCs differentiated into trophoblasts secreted increasing
levels of ß-hCG and concomitantly expressed the trophoblast genes, CDX2, TP63,
KRT7, ERVW1, CGA, GCM1, KLF4 and PPARG. In contrast, differentiated translocated 
hESCs displayed reduced and delayed secretion of ß-hCG concomitant with impaired 
expression of the trophoblastic genes. The reduced activation of trophoblastic
genes may be responsible for the impaired trophoblastic differentiation in
t(11;22)-hESCs, associated with implantation failure in unbalanced t(11;22)
embryos. Our t(11;22) hESCs are presented as a valuable human model for studying 
the mechanisms underlying implantation failure.

Nectins are immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules mainly localized in
adherens junctions. The transcription factor p63 is a master regulator of gene
expression in stratified epithelia and controls several molecular processes. As
mutations in the Pvrl1 and Pvrl4 genes encoding for nectins cause genetic
disorders with phenotypes similar to p63-related syndromes, we investigated
whether these proteins might be under p63 transcriptional control. Here, we show 
that in p63-null skin, Pvrl1 gene expression is strongly reduced, whereas Pvrl4
expression is unaffected. In human and mouse primary keratinocytes p63 depletion 
leads to a specific downregulation of the Pvrl1 gene. Consistent with a direct
regulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (ChIP) indicate that p63
binds to two conserved intronic Pvrl1 enhancer regions.
Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a rare
autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations in p63 gene, mainly
characterized by skin fragility. To test whether nectins may be affected in AEC
syndrome, their expression was measured in keratinocytes obtained from patients
with AEC or from a conditional mouse model for AEC syndrome. Pvrl1 expression was
reduced in AEC keratinocytes, consistent with impaired p63 function.
Surprisingly, Pvrl4 expression was similarly affected, in parallel with decreased
expression of the transcription factor Irf6. Consistent with the
well-characterized role of Irf6 in keratinocyte differentiation and its strong
downregulation in AEC syndrome, Irf6 depletion caused reduced expression of Pvrl4
in wild-type keratinocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that Pvrl1 is a 
bona fide target gene of the transcription factor p63, whereas Pvrl4 regulation
is linked to epidermal differentiation and is under Irf6 control.

<U+0394>NP63a, the predominant TP63 isoform expressed in diverse epithelial tissues,
including the mammary gland, is required for the preservation of stem cells and
has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Despite data characterizing 
<U+0394>NP63a as a master regulator of stem cell activity, identification of the targets
underlying these effects is incompletely understood. Recently, <U+0394>NP63a was
identified as a key regulator in the promotion of proinflammatory programs in
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Inflammation has been implicated as
a potent driver of cancer stem cell phenotypes and metastasis. In this study, we 
sought to identify novel targets of <U+0394>NP63a that confer cancer stem cell and
prometastatic properties. Data presented here identify the gene encoding the
chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) as a transcriptional target of <U+0394>NP63a. Our data
indicate that <U+0394>NP63a enhances CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells via its
binding at two regions within the CXCR4 promoter. The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100
was used to demonstrate that the pro-stem cell activity of <U+0394>NP63a is mediated
through its regulation of CXCR4. Importantly, we show that <U+0394>NP63a promotes the
chemotaxis of breast cancer cells towards the CXCR4 ligand SDF1a, a process
implicated in the trafficking of breast cancer cells to sites of metastasis. This
study highlights CXCR4 as a previously unidentified target of <U+0394>NP63a, which plays
a significant role in mediating <U+0394>NP63a-dependent stem cell activity and
chemotaxis toward SDF1a. Our findings suggest that <U+0394>NP63a regulation of CXCR4 may
have strong implications in the regulation of cancer stem cells and metastasis.

The association between common variations (rs10937405, rs4488809) on 3q28 and
lung cancer has been widely evaluated in various ethnic groups, since it was
first identified through genome-wide association approach. However, the results
have been inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship
and the effect of factors that might modify the risk, we performed this
meta-analysis. The random-effects model was applied, addressing heterogeneity and
publication bias. A total of 10 articles involving 36,221 cases and 58,108
controls were included. Overall, the summary per-allele OR of 1.19 (95 % CI
1.14-1.25, P < 10(-5)) and 1.17 (95 % CI 1.10-1.23, P < 10(-5)) was found for the
rs10937405 and rs4488809 polymorphisms, respectively. Significant results were
also observed in heterozygous and homozygous when compared with wild genotype for
these polymorphisms. Significant results were found in East Asians when
stratified by ethnicity, whereas no significant associations were found among
Caucasians. After stratifying by sample size, study design, control source and
sex, significant associations were also obtained. In addition, our data indicate 
that these polymorphisms are involved in lung cancer susceptibility and confer
its effect primarily in lung adenocarcinoma when stratified by histological
subtype. Furthermore, significant associations were also detected both
never-smokers and smokers for these polymorphisms. In conclusion, this
meta-analysis demonstrated that rs10937405 and rs4488809 are a risk factor
associated with increased non-small cell lung cancer susceptibility, particularly
for East Asian populations.

Extensive efforts have been made to understand the molecular actors that control 
epithelial cell fate. Although pieces of information have been obtained from
single-gene function investigations, the entire picture of the molecular
mechanisms involved in the regulation of epithelial homeostasis is still
mysterious. Growing data indicate that gene networks rather than single "master" 
genes dictate cell fate. In an attempt to characterize such gene networks, we
have been investigating the human keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation 
genes that act downstream of the transcription factor p63, a major regulator of
epidermal homeostasis. We identified two networks: the cell cycle network that
controls cell proliferation and the keratinocyte cell fate network. Through
further analysis of the existing data on epithelial tumorigenesis and induced
pluripotent stem cells, we propose a wind rose model of cell fate that is based
on a balance between these two different networks that ultimately control human
keratinocyte fate and epidermal homeostasis.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective is to assess the utility of the p63 and
a-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR) in resolving suspicious foci in prostatic
needle biopsy and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 470 cases are selected. These included 310 TURP
specimens, 157 needle biopsies and 03 radical prostatectomy specimens. All the
cases are reviewed and divided into three categories. Benign (370), cases with
suspicious foci (40 cases) and malignant (60 cases). Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
was carried out using monoclonal AMACR and p63 antibodies in the 40 suspicious
cases along with positive and negative controls.
RESULTS: This study showed AMACR had a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 92.5%, 
whereas p63 had a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%. All the 40 suspicious 
cases were resolved using a combination of morphology and IHC expression p63 and 
AMACR. In 13 (32.5%), of the 40 suspicious cases there was change of diagnosis
based of morphology, clinical details and staining with p63 and AMACR, In the 11 
cases (11/40), diagnosis was changed from the benign to malignant. In one case
benign to high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (1/40) and in one case
from malignant to benign (1/40). This change was statistically significant with P
value of 0.013.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination of p63 and AMACR is of great additional value in
combating the morphologically suspicious cases and should be used on case to case
basis especially in prostatic needle biopsies and small foci lesions.

Proper differentiation of placental epithelial cells, called trophoblast, is
required for implantation. Early during placentation, trophoblast cell columns
help anchor the developing embryo in the uterine wall. Although proximally
continuous with villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) distally, these cells differentiate
into invasive extravillous trophoblast. We previously reported that p63, a p53
family member, is highly expressed in proliferative villous CTB and required for 
induction of the trophoblast lineage in human pluripotent stem cells. We now
further explore its function in human trophoblast by using both primary CTB from 
the early placenta and established trophoblast cell lines. We show that p63 is
expressed in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive CTB and that its
expression decreases with differentiation into HLA-G(+) extravillous trophoblast.
In trophoblast cell lines, p63 is expressed in JEG3 cells but absent from HTR8
cells. Overexpression of p63 in both cell lines enhances cell proliferation and
significantly reduces cell migration; conversely, down-regulation of p63 in JEG3 
cells reduces cell proliferation and restores cell migration. Analysis of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, and matrix degradation
pathways shows that p63 blocks epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, promotes a
CTB-specific cell adhesion profile, and inhibits expression of matrix
metalloproteinases. Taken together, these data show that p63 maintains the
proliferative CTB state, at least partially through regulation of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, and matrix degradation
pathways.

Non-melanoma skin cancer represents the most common cancer in the United States. 
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is a subtype of NMSC that shows a
greater potential for invasion and metastasis. The current study identifies the
protein kinase C-associated kinase (PKK), which is also known as the
receptor-interacting protein kinase 4, as a suppressor of tumor growth in SCC of 
the skin. We show that expression of PKK is decreased in human SCC of the skin
compared with normal skin. Further, suppression of PKK in human keratinocytes
leads to increased cell proliferation. The use of RNA interference to reduce PKK 
expression in keratinocytes leads to an increase in S phase and in proteins that 
promote cell cycle progression. Consistent with the results obtained from cell
culture, there is a marked increased tumorigenesis after PKK knockdown in a
xenotransplant model and in soft agar assays. The loss of tumor suppression
involves the NF-<U+03BA>B and p63 pathways. NF-<U+03BA>B is inhibited through inhibition of
inhibitor of NF-<U+03BA>B kinase function and there is increased nuclear TP63 activity
after PKK knockdown. This study opens new avenues both in the discovery of
disease pathogenesis and for potential treatments.

The forkhead transcription factor FOXP1 is involved in B-cell development and
function and is generally regarded as an oncogene in activated B-cell-like
subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue lymphoma, lymphomas relying on constitutive nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B)
activity for survival. However, the mechanism underlying its putative oncogenic
activity has not been established. By gene expression microarray, upon
overexpression or silencing of FOXP1 in primary human B cells and DLBCL cell
lines, combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation
sequencing, we established that FOXP1 directly represses a set of 7 proapoptotic 
genes. Low expression of these genes, encoding the BH3-only proteins BIK and
Harakiri, the p53-regulatory proteins TP63, RASSF6, and TP53INP1, and AIM2 and
EAF2, is associated with poor survival in DLBCL patients. In line with these
findings, we demonstrated that FOXP1 promotes the expansion of primary mature
human B cells by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptosis, without affecting B-cell
proliferation. Furthermore, FOXP1 is dependent upon, and cooperates with, NF-<U+03BA>B
signaling to promote B-cell expansion and survival. Taken together, our data
indicate that, through direct repression of proapoptotic genes, (aberrant)
expression of FOXP1 complements (constitutive) NF-<U+03BA>B activity to promote B-cell
survival and can thereby contribute to B-cell homeostasis and lymphomagenesis.

In this work, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to individually study
human p53, p63 (full length and truncated forms) and p73. Using this cell system,
the effect of these proteins on cell proliferation and death, and the influence
of MDM2 and MDMX on their activities were analyzed. When expressed in yeast,
wild-type p53, TAp63, <U+0394>Np63 and TAp73 induced growth inhibition associated with
S-phase cell cycle arrest. This growth inhibition was accompanied by reactive
oxygen species production and autophagic cell death. Furthermore, they stimulated
rapamycin-induced autophagy. On the contrary, none of the tested p53 family
members induced apoptosis either per se or after apoptotic stimuli. As previously
reported for p53, also TAp63, <U+0394>Np63 and TAp73 increased actin expression levels
and its depolarization, suggesting that ACT1 is also a p63 and p73 putative yeast
target gene. Additionally, MDM2 and MDMX inhibited the activity of all tested p53
family members in yeast, although the effect was weaker on TAp63. Moreover,
Nutlin-3a and SJ-172550 were identified as potential inhibitors of the p73
interaction with MDM2 and MDMX, respectively. Altogether, the yeast-based assays 
herein developed can be envisaged as a simplified cell system to study the
involvement of p53 family members in autophagy, the modulation of their
activities by specific interactors (MDM2 and MDMX), and the potential of new
small molecules to modulate these interactions.

BACKGROUND: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin may
pose a diagnostic challenge for pathologists. p40 is a recently introduced
antibody that recognizes specific p63 protein isoforms and has shown superior
results labeling non-cutaneous SCC. We hypothesize that p40 may improve
diagnostic accuracy of poorly differentiated SCC.
METHODS: Twelve cases of poorly differentiated SCC were stained with p63, p40 and
cytokeratin MNF116. Control cases included nine atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX),
five cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and three giant cell tumors of soft tissue
(GCTST).
RESULTS: All 12 cases labeled with p63 and p40 and 11/12 were positive with
MNF116. Whereas p40 labeled fewer cells, it showed exclusive nuclear staining,
with no staining of cytoplasm or of background cells, in contrast to p63. Six of 
nine AFX and 2 of 3 GCTST showed scattered nuclear staining with p63 but were
negative with p40. Additionally, one LMS showed focal staining with MNF116 but
was negative with p40.
CONCLUSION: For the diagnosis of cutaneous poorly differentiated SCC, p40 appears
equally sensitive to MNF116 and p63. While labeling fewer cells, p40 labels
without confounding staining of tumor cytoplasm or background cells. More
importantly, p40 appears to be more specific for SCC than p63 and MNF116, each of
which occasionally labels non-squamous tumors.

Cutaneous spindle cell malignancies such as sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC), leiomyosarcoma, desmoplastic melanoma (DM) and atypical fibroxanthoma
(AFX) may be morphologically indistinguishable, yet accurate diagnosis is
important for appropriate clinical management. The distinction among these
entities relies on immunohistochemical evaluation for epidermal, muscle or
melanocytic differentiation. Epidermal differentiation markers include
cytokeratins and p63. p63 is expressed as two distinct isoforms, <U+0394>Np63 (p40) and 
TAp63. p40 positivity is highly specific for pulmonary SCC and head and neck
sarcomatoid SCC. We examined the utility of p40 vs. p63 immunostaining in the
differentiation of a variety of cutaneous spindle cell malignancies, including
sarcomatoid SCC (n = 27), AFX (n = 34) and DM (n = 10). p40 was less sensitive
than p63 for detecting sarcomatoid SCC (56% and 81%, respectively). p63 and p40
were comparably specific for sarcomatoid SCC relative to AFX, with only rare weak
staining of tumor cells for p63 and/or p40 in a minority of AFX cases, including 
one case with approximately 10% of cells staining weakly for p40. All cases of DM
were negative for p40 and p63. Our results support continued use of p63 for
diagnosis of cutaneous sarcomatoid SCC because of greater sensitivity relative to
p40.

Emerging evidence suggests that cancer is populated and maintained by
tumour-initiating cells (TICs) with stem-like properties similar to those of
adult tissue stem cells. Despite recent advances, the molecular regulatory
mechanisms that may be shared between normal and malignant stem cells remain
poorly understood. Here we show that the <U+0394>Np63 isoform of the Trp63 transcription
factor promotes normal mammary stem cell (MaSC) activity by increasing the
expression of the Wnt receptor Fzd7, thereby enhancing Wnt signalling.
Importantly, Fzd7-dependent enhancement of Wnt signalling by <U+0394>Np63 also governs
tumour-initiating activity of the basal subtype of breast cancer. These findings 
establish <U+0394>Np63 as a key regulator of stem cells in both normal and malignant
mammary tissues and provide direct evidence that breast cancer TICs and normal
MaSCs share common regulatory mechanisms.

Deletions of exons with regulatory activity at the DYNC1I1 locus are associated
with split-hand/split-foot malformation: array CGH screening of 134 unrelated
families.

BACKGROUND: A growing number of non-coding regulatory mutations are being
identified in congenital disease. Very recently also some exons of protein coding
genes have been identified to act as tissue specific enhancer elements and were
therefore termed exonic enhancers or "eExons".
METHODS: We screened a cohort of 134 unrelated families with
split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM) with high resolution array CGH for CNVs
with regulatory potential.
RESULTS: In three families with an autosomal dominant non-syndromic SHFM
phenotype we detected microdeletions encompassing the exonic enhancer (eExons) 15
and 17 of DYNC1I1. In a fourth family, who had hearing loss in addition to SHFM, 
we found a larger deletion of 510 kb including the eExons of DYNC1I1 and, in
addition, the human brain enhancer hs1642. Exons 15 and 17 of DYNC1I1 are known
to act as tissue specific limb enhancers of DLX5/6, two genes that have been
shown to be associated with SHFM in mice. In our cohort of 134 unrelated families
with SHFM, deletions of the eExons of DYNC1I1 account for approximately 3% of the
cases, while 17p13.3 duplications were identified in 13% of the families, 10q24
duplications in 12%, and TP63 mutations were detected in 4%.
CONCLUSIONS: We reduce the minimal critical region for SHFM1 to 78 kb. Hearing
loss, however, appears to be associated with deletions of a more telomeric region
encompassing the brain enhancer element hs1642. Thus, SHFM1 as well as hearing
loss at the same locus are caused by deletion of regulatory elements. Deletions
of the exons with regulatory potential of DYNC1I1 are an example of the emerging 
role of exonic enhancer elements and their implications in congenital
malformation syndromes.

TAp63a is a member of the p53 family, which plays a central role in epithelial
cancers. Recently, a role has emerged for p53 family members in cancer metabolic 
modulation. In order to assess whether TAp63a plays a role in cancer metabolism, 
we exploited p53-null osteosarcoma Tet-On Saos-2 cells, in which the expression
of TAp63a was dependent on doxycycline supplementation to the medium.
Metabolomics labeling experiments were performed by incubating the cells in
13C-glucose or 13C15N-glutamine-labeled culture media, as to monitor metabolic
fluxes upon induced expression of TAp63a. Induced expression of TAp63a resulted
in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. From a metabolic standpoint, expression of 
Tap63a promoted glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, which was uncoupled
from nucleotide biosynthesis, albeit prevented oxidative stress in the form of
oxidized glutathione. Double 13C-glucose and 13C15N-glutamine metabolic labeling 
confirmed that induced expression of TAp63a corresponded to a decreased flux of
pyruvate to the Krebs cycle and decreased utilization of glutamine for catabolic 
purposes in the TCA cycle. Results were not conclusive in relation to anabolic
utilization of labeled glutamine, since it is unclear to what extent the observed
minor TAp63a-dependent increases of glutamine-derived labeling in palmitate could
be tied to increased rates of reductive carboxylation and de novo synthesis of
fatty acids. Finally, bioinformatics elaborations highlighted a link between
patient survival rates and the co-expression of p63 and rate limiting enzymes of 
the pentose phosphate pathway, G6PD and PGD.

An antibody cocktail directed against p63, cytokeratin (CK)5/14, and CK7/18 is
reported to be useful in distinguishing noninvasive from invasive breast lesions 
and for the characterization of intraductal epithelial proliferations. However,
limited studies evaluate its use in clinical practice. A retrospective review of 
breast material at a university medical center identified cases that were
immunostained with the above antibody cocktail. Additional p63 immunostaining
alone was performed to further determine the utility of the antibody cocktail in 
the evaluation of invasion. Of 50 breast cases identified, the antibody cocktail 
was used to confirm or exclude invasion in 44 (88%). Twenty-two (50%) of these
had easily identifiable p63/CK5/14-positive myoepithelial cells, whereas the
remainder lacked such staining, confirming the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma.
In 27 cases with available diagnostic material for additional p63 immunostaining,
the cocktail better highlighted myoepithelial cells by staining nuclei and
cytoplasm. Easier identification of invasion was also facilitated by CK7/18
expression in invasive foci, especially those composed of single cells. Ten cases
were immunostained to help determine the nature of an intraductal proliferation. 
The cocktail demonstrated a mosaic staining pattern of both CK7/18- and
CK5/14-positive epithelial cells in 3 (30%) cases consistent with usual
hyperplasia; homogenous CK7/18 expression in the remaining cases supported the
diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia or carcinoma in situ. In summary, the
p63/CK7/18/CK5/14 cocktail stain appears to be a useful tool in diagnostic breast
pathology, in the evaluation of possible invasion, particularly in the setting of
minute foci of invasion as well as in epithelial proliferations.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have investigated the role of the p53 gene family in
reproductive processes. Each member of the gene family acts through different
mechanisms: p53 is involved in genomic stability and regulation of blastocyst
implantation; p63 acts as a regulator of the quality and maturation of oocytes;
and p73 controls the meiotic spindle. Polymorphisms in the genes of the p53
family have been associated with female infertility. One polymorphism in MDM2,
the main regulator of the p53 family, has also been associated with this
condition. Although polymorphisms in the TP53 gene have been related to recurrent
pregnancy loss (RPL), there have been no studies associating polymorphisms in p63
and p73 with RPL. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of
polymorphisms in the TP63 (rs17506395), TP73 (rs2273953, rs1801173), and MDM2
(SNP309, rs2279744) genes as risk factors for RPL.
STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted in 153 women with RPL and 143
fertile women with at least two living children and no history of pregnancy loss.
Molecular analysis was performed by TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assay. The
statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20.0 and the
chi-square test, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression to
compare the evaluated characteristics between both groups and RPL outcome.
RESULTS: The allelic and genotypic frequencies did not differ between the groups 
when analyzed separately, however, the interaction between the TP63 TT and MDM2
TT genotypes was shown to increase the risk of RPL (OR=2.19, CI 95%: 1.28-3.75,
p=0.004), even when adjusted for alcohol consumption, smoking, number of
pregnancies and ethnicity (OR=1.97, CI 95%: 1.27-3.58, p=0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genes from the p53 family proteins,
evaluated here, have an influence on the risk of RPL.

OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have confirmed association of TP63C/T 
rs710521, TERTC/T rs2736098, and SLC14A1C/T rs17674580 gene variants with
susceptibility to bladder cancer (BC) in European and White population. However, 
the risk conferred for BC for above gene variants in North Indians is unknown. We
therefore, studied the association of TP63C/T, TERTC/T, and SLC14A1C/T single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a risk of BC susceptibility in North Indian 
cohort.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In histologically confirmed 225 BC cases and 240 healthy
controls, 3 SNPs were genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. To
evaluate the SNP effects on BC susceptibility, odds ratio (OR) and CI 95% were
calculated.
RESULTS: In case of TP63C/T, the variant genotype (TT) showed significant reduced
risk for BC (P = 0.045, OR = 0.53). Combining heterozygous and variant genotypes 
also demonstrated reduced risk for BC (P< 0.001, OR = 0.54). In case of TERTC/T, 
heterozygous genotype (CT) as well as variant genotype (TT) showed significant
risk for BC susceptibility (P = 0.031, OR = 1.77 and P = 0.004, OR = 2.78,
respectively) along with T allelic level (P<0.001, OR = 4.19). Furthermore, in
case of SLC14A1C/T gene polymorphism, the variant genotype (TT) showed
significant high risk for BC susceptibility (P = 0.006; OR = 3.01) along with
variant T allelic level (P = 0.003, OR = 1.52). Interestingly, smoking was also
found to modulate risks for BC in case of TERT and SLC14A1 variant genotype (TT).
Further clinical confounding factor, namely, tumor grade/stage level of cases,
supports the genotypic data with TERT and SLC14A1 showing a risk for BC
susceptibility.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that polymorphism in TERTC/T and SLC14A1C/T
confirmed high risk for BC in North Indian population. However, TP63C/T showed
reduced risk of BC susceptibility. More replicate studies with large sample size 
and diverse ethnicity are required to validate these observations.

Ectodermal dysplasias caused by mutations in the TP63 gene comprise a group of
disorders characterized by a spectrum of ectodermal changes, orofacial clefting, 
and split hand or foot malformation. We report on a boy with a mutation located
in the DNA-binding domain of the TP63 gene with atypical phenotype. These data
provide additional evidence of the great variability seen in TP63-related
disorders and further delineation of genotype-phenotype correlations.

BACKGROUND: Split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a clinically and genetically
heterogeneous limb abnormality characterized by the absence or hypoplasia of the 
central rays of the autopod. SHFM1, which is one out of seven known SHFM loci,
maps to 7q21.2-q21.3. SHFM1 is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait
with reduced penetrance, although recessive inheritance has been described for a 
single family carrying a homozygous DLX5 missense variant. In most cases, SHFM1
results from heterozygous deletions encompassing DLX5/DLX6 genes or from
inversions and translocations separating the genes from their limb specific
enhancers. Recently, a single Chinese family with dominant SHFM1 was shown to
result from a heterozygous DLX5 missense mutation.
METHODS: In this study, we report on four male individuals from two unrelated
Polish families (one sporadic and one familial case) presenting with isolated
SHFM. We tested both probands for known molecular causes of SHFM, including TP63,
WNT10B, DLX5 mutations and copy number changes using 1.4 M array CGH.
RESULTS: Sanger sequencing of DLX5 revealed a novel heterozygous nonsense
mutation c.G115T(p.E39X) in both index patients. Segregation studies demonstrated
that the variant was present in all affected family members but also in three
apparently healthy relatives (two females and one male).
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a heterozygous DLX5 nonsense mutation
resulting in incompletely penetrant autosomal dominant isolated SHFM1. Data shown
here provides further evidence for the contribution of DLX5 point mutations to
the development of ectrodactyly and suggest the possibility of sex-related
segregation distortion with an excess of affected males.

The TP63 gene encodes a member of the p53 family of transcription factors.
Although TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene, the role of p63 in
tumorigenesis is controversial. Our group recently identified novel chromosomal
rearrangements involving TP63 in approximately 6% of peripheral T-cell lymphomas,
which correlated with a p63+/p40- immunohistochemical profile. As a subset of
lung adenocarcinomas are p63+/p40-, we undertook the current study to examine the
presence of TP63 rearrangements and correlate with p63/p40 expression.
Next-generation sequencing was used to identify genomic rearrangements of TP63 in
37 adenocarcinomas. Confirmatory fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using 
a break-apart probe to the TP63 gene region and immunohistochemistry for p63 and 
p40 were performed on adenocarcinomas with TP63 rearrangements identified by
mate-pair sequencing. Immunohistochemistry for p63 and p40 was performed on 45
additional adenocarcinomas, and FISH was performed on all adenocarcinomas with
p63 positivity. TP63 rearrangement was identified in two adenocarcinoma specimens
from a single patient. The rearrangement resulted in a complex rearrangement of
3q that fused B3GALNT1 at the 3' intron to TP63. FISH confirmed the rearrangement
in both tumors. Immunohistochemistry staining for p63 was diffuse (>80% cells+)
and p40 was negative. Of the 44 additional adenocarcinomas, 13 (30%) showed p63
expression; p40 was negative in all cases. No case showed rearrangement of TP63
by a break-apart FISH. However, extra copies of the intact TP63 locus were seen
in the p63-positive areas of all 12 cases, with copy numbers ranging from three
to seven. We have identified a novel chromosomal rearrangement involving TP63 in 
a p63+/p40- lung adenocarcinoma. Break-apart FISH testing can be used to diagnose
this finding. Immunohistochemistry for p63 was not specific for this
rearrangement, as nearly 33% of adenocarcinomas expressed p63. Additional copies 
of the intact TP63 locus were also a common finding and correlated with
immunohistochemistry positivity for p63.

In the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD), keratinocytes release large
quantities of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), causing unfavorable
inflammation along with skin damage. Nevertheless, how TSLP influences
keratinocytes themselves is still unknown. In this study, we showed that <U+0394>Np63, a
p53-homologue, predominantly expressed in keratinocytes regulated the receptor
complex of TSLP, which determines susceptibility to self-derived TSLP. Expression
of TSLP receptors in skin tissues and keratinocytes was assessed by
immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR, and in vitro studies were also
performed to examine the functional relevance of <U+0394>Np63 in the expression of TSLP 
receptors and the constituting autocrine and/or paracrine pathway of TSLP under
the condition of stimuli to innate receptors sensing cell damage. The results
showed that normal keratinocytes in the upper epidermis preferentially expressed 
TSLP receptors and conversely lacked <U+0394>Np63, which has an inhibitory effect on the
expression of TSLP receptors. Interestingly, the epidermis of AD lesions was
found to abundantly contain keratinocytes with low or undetectable levels of
<U+0394>Np63 (<U+0394>Np63(lo/-)). Moreover, in the absence of <U+0394>Np63, keratinocytes readily
presented TSLP and other cytokines by stimuli through Toll-like receptor 3
(TLR3). Together with the evidence that extrinsic TSLP itself augments TSLP
production by keratinocytes without <U+0394>Np63, the results indicate that <U+0394>Np63(lo/-) 
keratinocytes generate TSLP through a putative autocrine and/or paracrine pathway
upon TLR3 stimulation within AD lesions, since moieties of damaged cells and
pathogens stimulate TLR3.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that suppress the expression
of protein-coding genes by repressing protein translation. Although the roles
that miRs and the miR processing machinery have in regulating epithelial stem
cell biology are not fully understood, their fundamental contributions to these
processes have been demonstrated over the last few years. The p53-family member
p63 is an essential transcription factor for epidermal morphogenesis and
homeostasis. p63 functions as a determinant for keratinocyte cell fate and helps 
to regulate the balance between stemness, differentiation and senescence. An
important factor that regulates p63 function is the reciprocal interaction
between p63 and miRs. Some miRs control p63 expression, and p63 regulates the miR
expression profile in the epidermis. p63 controls miR expression at different
levels. It directly regulates the transcription of several miRs and indirectly
regulates their processing by regulating the expression of the miR processing
components Dicer and DGCR8. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings
on the miR-p63 interaction in epidermal biology, particularly focusing on the
<U+0394>Np63-dependent regulation of DGCR8 recently described in the <U+0394>Np63(-/-) mouse.
We provide a unified view of the current knowledge and discuss the apparent
discrepancies and perspective therapeutic opportunities.

Altered expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) has been observed in human
cervical cancer. However, the biological functions of many of these miRNAs are
yet to be discovered. We previously showed that miR-944 is significantly more
abundant in cervical cancer tissues than their normal counterparts. In this
study, we investigated the functions and targets of miR-944 in human cervical
cancer cells. MiR-944 is located in the intron of the tumor protein p63 (TP63)
gene, which is frequently overexpressed in cervical carcinomas. Using gain- and
loss-of-function experiments in vitro, we demonstrate that miR-944 promotes cell 
proliferation, migration and invasion, but has no effect on apoptosis, in human
cervical cancer cells. To identify the targets of miR-944, we performed
photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation
followed by deep sequencing. Among the candidate targets, we validated HECW2
(HECT domain ligase W2) and S100PBP (S100P binding protein) as direct targets of 
miR-944 using luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis. Our findings 
reveal novel functions and targets of miR-944 in human cervical cancer cells,
which may provide new insights of its role in cervical carcinogenesis.

Associating the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with genetic
predisposition is still a challenge. Here, we discuss two non-twinned sibs (girl 
and boy) diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP-ALL) and ETV6-RUNX1. BCP-ALL
clinical onset occurred 10months apart from each diagnosis. One child is alive in
complete continuous remission, whereas, the other relapsed and evolved to death
with resistance to ALL treatment. Despite the fact that BCP-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1
usually results in a very good prognosis, the sibs experienced divergent
outcomes; a remarkable difference in one child that presented a more aggressive
disease was higher leukocytosis associated with IKZF1 deletion. The familial
history of cancer and genetic susceptibility was explored. The sibs were
absolutely identical in all 17 loci of genes tested; GSTM1, GSTT1, NQO1, TP53,
and TP63 were wild-type, whereas at least one copy of the variant allele for
IKZF1, ARID5B, PTPRJ and CEBPE was present. The familial pattern of ETV6 was
tested by the 12p microsatellite analysis and demonstrated that deletions
occurred in one child but not the other, while heterozygous patterns were found
in the parents. Altogether, our data suggest that genetic predisposition aligned 
with chance haa an additive effect in BCP-ALL outcome.

INTRODUCTION: It has been estimated that the proportion of never-smokers among
females with lung cancer is 53% worldwide and 75% in Korea. We conducted a
two-stage study to identify genetic factors responsible for lung cancer
susceptibility in female never-smokers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a discovery set, 1969 potentially functional single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 1151 genes, which were related to cancer
development and progression, were evaluated using the Affymetrix custom-made
GeneChip in 181 female never-smokers with lung cancer and 179 controls. A
replication study was performed on an independent cohort of 596 cases and 1194
healthy controls.
RESULTS: Sixteen SNPs with p < 0.05 for genotype distribution in the discovery
set were enrolled in the replication study. Among 16 SNPs, three SNPs
(colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor [CSF1R] rs10079250A>G, tumor protein p63
[TP63] rs7631358G>A, and corepressor interacting with RBPJ 1 [CIR1]
rs13009079T>C) were found to be significantly associated with lung cancer in the 
same direction as the discovery set. Homology-based model for CSF1R indicated
that the rs10079250A>G leads to increased positive charge of CSF-binding region
of CSF1R, thereby increasing the chance of binding between CSF and CSF1R. In
addition, this SNP was found to increase the phosphorylation of a
mitogen-activated protein kinase, JNK.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the three SNPs, particularly CSF1R
rs10079250, may contribute to lung cancer susceptibility in never-smoking
females.

To explore the histogenesis of cuboidal and polygonal tumor cells in the
sclerosing hemangioma of lung (SHL), eighteen cases of SHL were retrospectively
studied. SPB, p40, TTF-1,EMA,CKpan, vimentin,SMA, CgA,Syn and CD34 were
immunohistochemically labeled by the EnVisionmethod. It was found that the four
main types of structure in SHL were solid,papillary, hemorrhagic and sclerotic
patterns. The tumor cells were composed mainly of two types of cells: cuboidal
tumor cells and polygonal tumor cells. The immunohistochemistry showed that p40
was expressed only in cuboidal tumor cells. TTF-1 and EMA were expressed in both 
polygonal cells and cuboidal cells. SPB was also expressed in cuboidal tumor
cells; vimentin was expressed in all polygonal tumor cells and some cuboidal
cells. The findings suggest that the p40-positive cuboidal tumor cells may be
pluripotent original respiratory epithelial cells, with multi-directional
differentiation capacity.

Histopathological subtyping of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently
important in selecting specific therapeutic agents. It can be challenging in
distinguishing poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (AC) from squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) on small biopsy samples. This study was aimed to evaluate the
utility of a panel of immunohistochemical markers consisting of <U+0394>Np63 (p40),
cytokeratins (CK) 5/6, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and napsin A (novel
aspartic proteinase of the pepsin family) in subtyping poorly differentiated
NSCLC. Forty-eight cases of NSCLC that could not be further classified by
examination of hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)-stained slides on biopsy and had
subsequent resection specimens were selected. Subtyping of the tumor was based on
the resection specimen using the World Health Organization criteria. <U+0394>Np63 was
expressed in all 16 SCCs (100%), and was negative in all ACs and LCCs. CK5/6 was 
positive in 13 of 16 SCCs (81%), and was negative in all ACs and LCCs. TTF-1 was 
positive in 20 of 25 ACs (80%) and 3 of 7 LCCs (43%), but none of 16 SCCs. Napsin
A was positive in 16 of 25 ACs (64%) and was negative in all SCCs and LCCs. Our
study shows that a panel including <U+0394>Np63, CK5/6, TTF-1, and napsin A allows
correct subclassification of 39 of 48 cases of NSCLC on biopsy and may contribute
to refine lung cancer classification in biopsy specimens, remarkably reducing the
NSCLC-NOS (not otherwise specified) diagnostic category.

Whether the Hippo pathway contributes to cell lineage transition under
pathological conditions, especially tumorigenesis, remains largely unknown. Here 
we show that YAP, the major effector of the Hippo pathway, displays a distinct
activation pattern in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC); YAP is initially activated by LKB1 loss in lung ADC, which upregulates
ZEB2 expression and represses DNp63 transcription in a default manner. During
transdifferentiation, YAP is inactivated, which in turn relieves ZEB2-mediated
default repression of DNp63 and triggers squamous differentiation reprogramming. 
Disruption of the YAP barrier for phenotypic transition significantly accelerates
squamous transdifferentiation, whereas constitutive YAP activation conversely
inhibits this transition. More importantly, ectopic DNp63 expression rescues the 
inhibitory effect of YAP on squamous transdifferentiation. These findings have
established YAP as an essential barrier for lung cancer cell fate conversion and 
provided a mechanism for regulating cancer plasticity, which might hold important
implication for YAP-targeted therapies.

Recent genomic analyses of pathologically defined tumor types identify
"within-a-tissue" disease subtypes. However, the extent to which genomic
signatures are shared across tissues is still unclear. We performed an
integrative analysis using five genome-wide platforms and one proteomic platform 
on 3,527 specimens from 12 cancer types, revealing a unified classification into 
11 major subtypes. Five subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-of-origin 
counterparts, but several distinct cancer types were found to converge into
common subtypes. Lung squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers
coalesced into one subtype typified by TP53 alterations, TP63 amplifications, and
high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder
cancers split into three pan-cancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification,
while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for
predicting clinical outcomes. All data sets are available for data-mining from a 
unified resource to support further biological discoveries and insights into
novel therapeutic strategies.

Limbal epithelial stem cell deficiency can cause blindness but may be treated by 
human limbal epithelial cell (hLE) transplantation, normally on human amniotic
membrane. Clinical outcomes using amnion can be unreliable and so we have
developed an alternative tissue equivalent (TE), RAFT (Real Architecture for 3D
Tissue), which supports hLE expansion, and stratification when airlifted. Human
limbal fibroblasts (hLF) may be incorporated into RAFT TEs, where they support
overlying hLE and improve phenotype. However, the impact of neither airlifting
nor hLF on hLE function has been investigated. hLE on RAFT TEs (±hLF and
airlifting) were wounded using heptanol and re-epithelialisation (fluorescein
diacetate staining), and percentage putative stem cell marker p63a and
proliferative marker Ki67 expression (wholemount immunohistochemistry), measured.
Airlifted, hLF- RAFT TEs were unable to close the wound and p63a expression was 7
± 0.2% after wounding. Conversely, non-airlifted, hLF- RAFT TEs closed the wound 
within 9 days and p63a expression was higher at 22 ± 5% (p < 0.01). hLE on both
hLF- and hLF+ RAFT TEs (non-airlifted) closed the wound and p63a expression was
26 ± 8% and 36 ± 3% respectively (ns). Ki67 expression by hLE increased from 1.3 
± 0.5% before wounding to 7.89 ± 2.53% post-wounding for hLF- RAFT TEs (p <
0.01), and 0.8 ± 0.08% to 17.68 ± 10.88% for hLF+ RAFT TEs (p < 0.05), suggesting
that re-epithelialisation was a result of proliferation. These data suggest that 
neither airlifting nor hLF are necessarily required to maintain a functional
epithelium on RAFT TEs, thus simplifying and shortening the production process.
This is important when working towards clinical application of regenerative
medicine products.

Although p53 has long been known as the "guardian of the genome" with a role in
tumor suppression in many tissues, the discovery of two p53 ancestral genes, p63 
and p73, more than a decade ago has triggered a considerable amount of research
into the role of these genes in skin development and diseases. In this review, we
primarily focus on mechanisms of action of p53 and p63, which are the
best-studied p53 family members in the skin. The existence of multiple isoforms
and their roles as transcriptional activators and repressors are key to their
function in multiple biological processes including the control of skin
morphogenesis, regeneration, tumorigenesis, and response to chemotherapy. Last,
we provide directions for further research on this family of genes in skin
biology and pathology.

<U+0394>Np63a enhances the oncogenic phenotype of osteosarcoma cells by inducing the
expression of GLI2.

BACKGROUND: <U+0394>Np63, a splice variant of p63, is overexpressed and exhibits
oncogenic activity in many cancers including pancreatic and breast cancer and
promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Despite its role in
tumorigenesis, mechanistic activity of <U+0394>Np63 mediated oncogenic function in
osteosarcoma is poorly understood.
METHODS: The expression levels of p63 isoforms in osteosarcoma cell lines were
identified using quantitative techniques. Expression profiling using microarray, 
siRNA mediated loss-of-function, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were
employed to identify novel <U+0394>Np63a targets in p63-null osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells
that were engineered to express <U+0394>Np63a. The phenotype of SaOS-2-<U+0394>Np63a cells was 
assessed using wound-healing, colony formation, and proliferation assays.
RESULTS: The comparative expression analyses identified <U+0394>Np63a as the predominant
p63 isoform expressed by invasive OS cell lines. Phenotypic analyses of
SaOS-2-<U+0394>Np63a cells in vitro indicate that <U+0394>Np63a imparted tumorigenic attributes
upon tumor cells. Further, we show that in osteosarcoma cells <U+0394>Np63a directly
regulated the transcription factor GLI2, which is a component of the hedgehog
signaling pathway, and that functional interactions between <U+0394>Np63a and GLI2
confer oncogenic properties upon OS cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report that GLI2 is the novel target gene of <U+0394>Np63a and
that <U+0394>Np63a-GLI2 crosstalk in osteosarcoma cells is a necessary event in
osteosarcoma progression. Defining the exact mechanisms involved in this
interaction that mediate the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma promises to identify
targets for drug therapy.

Medical University, Beijing, China.

AIM: It has been shown that glycolytic metabolism is increased in malignant
cells. Cancer cell growth is an energy-related process supported by an increased 
glucose metabolism. In addition, p63, a known homolog of p53, is expressed
predominantly in basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the expression of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) and
p63 in patients with serous ovarian tumor (benign, borderline and malignant) and 
study their close relationship with the malignant transformation of serous
ovarian tumors.
METHODS: Two hundred formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were
immunostained with rabbit anti-GLUT1 polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-p63
monoclonal antibody using the streptavidin-biotin method. The samples were as
follows: 40 normal ovarian tissues, 40 serous cystadenomas, 40 borderline serous 
cystadenomas and 80 serous cystadenocarcinomas were stained.
RESULT: Normal ovarian tissues showed completely negative staining for GLUT1 and 
p63. However, from benign serious cystadenomas, borderline cystadenomas to
cystadenocarcinomas, the expression of GLUT1 and p63 grew stronger (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05).
Moreover, the intensity staining of GLUT1 maintained a significant association
with the expression of p63 (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). In <U+03C7>²-test analysis, expression of
borderline cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas, intraperitoneal implants,
ascites, lymph node status and International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and GLUT1 expression levels have an appalling
significance (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05), while FIGO stage, intraperitoneal implants and lymph
node status except patient age and ascites have a statistical significance with
the expression of p63 levels (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings show a progressive increase in the expression of GLUT1
and p63 from the benign serous cystadenomas, borderline cystadenomas to
cystadenocarcinomas. Overexpression of GLUT1 and p63 are associated with the
histology FIGO stage and metastasis of the tumors. These data suggested that the 
expression of GLUT1 and p63 may be closely related to the malignant
transformation of serous ovarian tumors. However, the relative importance of
GLUT1 and p63 in ovarian serous tumor development and tumorigenesis remains
mostly unclear and awaits further investigation.

A subset of malignant phyllodes tumors express p63 and p40: a diagnostic pitfall 
in breast core needle biopsies.

Breast phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial neoplasms of variable grade, and
one key differential of malignant phyllodes on core biopsy is sarcomatoid
carcinoma. p63 is reported to be sensitive and specific for sarcomatoid
carcinoma, with rare expression in phyllodes in limited series. The p63 deltaNp63
isoform, p40, is postulated to be more specific for squamous differentiation but 
has not previously been evaluated in breast phyllodes or sarcomatoid carcinoma.
Tissue microarrays containing 34 unambiguous phyllodes tumors (10 benign, 10
borderline, 14 malignant), 13 sarcomatoid carcinomas, and 10 fibroadenomas were
labeled by immunohistochemistry for p63, p40, CD34, and cytokeratins AE1/AE3,
34betaE12, and CK8/18. No borderline phyllodes tumor, benign phyllodes tumor, or 
fibroadenoma labeled with p63, p40, or cytokeratin. However, p63 labeled 57%
malignant phyllodes tumors and 62% sarcomatoid carcinomas, and p40 labeled 29%
malignant phyllodes (focal) and 46% sarcomatoid carcinomas. Among established
markers, cytokeratins labeled 21% malignant phyllodes tumors (focal) and 100%
sarcomatoid carcinomas. CD34 labeled 57% malignant phyllodes tumors and no
sarcomatoid carcinomas. Focal p63, p40, and cytokeratin labeling can be seen in
malignant phyllodes tumors but not in lower-grade fibroepithelial lesions, and
immunoreactivity with these markers alone is not diagnostic of sarcomatoid
carcinoma on core needle biopsy. In the differential diagnosis of malignant
phyllodes, p40 is a more specific but less sensitive marker of sarcomatoid
carcinoma than p63. These results are consistent with the sarcoma literature in
which p63 labeling has been increasingly reported and suggest caution in
classifying malignant spindle cell tumors of the breast on core biopsy.

The development of esophageal squamous carcinomas (ESC) results from numerous
genetic alterations. Our previous study demonstrated that p63 is highly expressed
in human ESC cells and stimulates their growth; however, the mechanism by which
p63 regulates ESC cell adhesion and invasion remains unclear. In the present
study, we further elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms by which p63
regulates metastasis in ESC cells. Knockdown of p63 significantly diminished the 
invasion of ESC cell lines TE-8 and TE-12, whereas overexpression of p63
significantly increased the migration rates of BE3 and OE33 cells. The mRNA and
protein levels of vimentin, twist, SUSD2, and uPA were significantly decreased in
p63-knockdown ESC cells, while overexpression of p63 induced an increase in
vimentin, SUSD2, and uPA. In addition, knockdown of p63 in ESC cells
significantly reduced levels of ß-catenin and c-Myc, while overexpression of p63 
increased ß-catenin, but reduced p-ß-catenin level. Therefore, p63 regulates the 
migration and invasion of ESC cells through activation of the ß-catenin/c-Myc
pathway. Our results suggest that targeting p63 may constitute a potential
therapeutic strategy for ESC.

BACKGROUND: To date, no robust biomarkers have been available in clinical
practice that can provide an early diagnostic evaluation of lung cancer. The
objective of this study was to identify potential biomarkers for the early
detection of lung cancer using bronchial brushing specimens.
METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was used to investigate the expression of 35
proteins in 880 bronchial brushing specimens from both outpatients and inpatients
who had either lung cancer or benign lung lesions. An optimal panel was
identified that had high sensitivity and considerable specificity for detecting
lung cancer. Associations between protein expression and clinicopathologic
parameters were assessed.
RESULTS: Tumor protein 53 (TP53), TP63, Ki67, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6), MCM7,
uncharacterized proteins KIAA1522 and KIAA0317, and ubiquitin-protein ligase UHR1
(ICBP90) frequently presented high expression in bronchial brushing specimens
from patients who had lung cancer compared with patients who had benign lung
lesions. A 6-protein panel consisting of TP53, Ki67, MCM6, MCM7, KIAA1522, and
KIAA0317 was identified as the best combination, with sensitivity of 81.1% (309
of 381 specimens) for detecting nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 86.8% (145 
of 167 specimens) for detecting small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (specificity,
83.3%; 65 of 78 specimens). The combination of cytology and the protein panel
significantly improved the sensitivity of bronchial brushing examination for
detecting lung cancer (P<.00001), which increased from 49.1% to 81% in early
stage NSCLC (stage I and II). In combined analyses, the protein panel was
positively associated with patient sex (P=.00033), tumor type (P<.00001), tumor
location (P<.00001), and lymph node metastasis (P=.028).
CONCLUSIONS: The 6-protein panel is a potential biomarker for the early detection
of lung cancer in bronchial brushings.

The surface of the cornea consists of a unique type of non-keratinized epithelial
cells arranged in an orderly fashion, and this is essential for vision by
maintaining transparency for light transmission. Cornea epithelial cells (CECs)
undergo continuous renewal from limbal stem or progenitor cells (LSCs), and
deficiency in LSCs or corneal epithelium--which turns cornea into a
non-transparent, keratinized skin-like epithelium--causes corneal surface disease
that leads to blindness in millions of people worldwide. How LSCs are maintained 
and differentiated into corneal epithelium in healthy individuals and which key
molecular events are defective in patients have been largely unknown. Here we
report establishment of an in vitro feeder-cell-free LSC expansion and
three-dimensional corneal differentiation protocol in which we found that the
transcription factors p63 (tumour protein 63) and PAX6 (paired box protein PAX6) 
act together to specify LSCs, and WNT7A controls corneal epithelium
differentiation through PAX6. Loss of WNT7A or PAX6 induces LSCs into skin-like
epithelium, a critical defect tightly linked to common human corneal diseases.
Notably, transduction of PAX6 in skin epithelial stem cells is sufficient to
convert them to LSC-like cells, and upon transplantation onto eyes in a rabbit
corneal injury model, these reprogrammed cells are able to replenish CECs and
repair damaged corneal surface. These findings suggest a central role of the
WNT7A-PAX6 axis in corneal epithelial cell fate determination, and point to a new
strategy for treating corneal surface diseases.

Corneal epithelial homeostasis and regeneration are sustained by limbal stem
cells (LSCs), and LSC deficiency is a major cause of blindness worldwide.
Transplantation is often the only therapeutic option available to patients with
LSC deficiency. However, while transplant success depends foremost on LSC
frequency within grafts, a gene allowing for prospective LSC enrichment has not
been identified so far. Here we show that ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B,
member 5 (ABCB5) marks LSCs and is required for LSC maintenance, corneal
development and repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prospectively isolated
human or murine ABCB5-positive LSCs possess the exclusive capacity to fully
restore the cornea upon grafting to LSC-deficient mice in xenogeneic or syngeneic
transplantation models. ABCB5 is preferentially expressed on label-retaining LSCs
in mice and p63a-positive LSCs in humans. Consistent with these findings,
ABCB5-positive LSC frequency is reduced in LSC-deficient patients. Abcb5 loss of 
function in Abcb5 knockout mice causes depletion of quiescent LSCs due to
enhanced proliferation and apoptosis, and results in defective corneal
differentiation and wound healing. Our results from gene knockout studies, LSC
tracing and transplantation models, as well as phenotypic and functional analyses
of human biopsy specimens, provide converging lines of evidence that ABCB5
identifies mammalian LSCs. Identification and prospective isolation of
molecularly defined LSCs with essential functions in corneal development and
repair has important implications for the treatment of corneal disease,
particularly corneal blindness due to LSC deficiency.

Micropapillary urothelial carcinoma (MPUC) is an uncommon variant of urothelial
carcinoma (UC) with an aggressive clinical course. There have been limited
studies on the UC markers GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), p63, and p40 in MPUC.
Our study investigated the immunoreactivity of these 3 markers in MPUC compared
with conventional UC of different grades and stages. Immunohistochemistry was
performed on 62 cases of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC), 16 low-grade
urothelial carcinoma (LGUC), and 20 MPUC. p63 expression was strong and diffuse
in all LGUC, significantly decreased in high stage and HGUC, and virtually absent
in MPUC. p40 expression was decreased in HGUC and markedly decreased in MPUC
relative to LGUC. These results suggest that loss of p63 expression in a UC
appears to be associated with adverse features--including cases with
micropapillary differentiation. Decreased GATA3 expression was seen frequently in
high-grade and high-pathologic stage (=pT2) tumors but was retained in MPUC
cases. The findings of retained GATA3 expression in MPUC, which often shows a
loss of expression of other urothelial markers such as p63, may be helpful for
determining the origin of micropapillary carcinoma of unknown primary. Compared
with the traditional markers p63 and p40, GATA3 is the most sensitive marker of
conventional UC and MPUC.

TP53 belongs to a small gene family that includes, in mammals, two additional
paralogs, TP63 and TP73. The p63 and p73 proteins are structurally and
functionally similar to p53 and their activity as transcription factors is
regulated by a wide repertoire of shared and unique post-translational
modifications and interactions with regulatory cofactors. p63 and p73 have
important functions in embryonic development and differentiation but are also
involved in tumor suppression. The biology of p63 and p73 is complex since both
TP63 and TP73 genes are transcribed into a variety of different isoforms that
give rise to proteins with antagonistic properties, the TA-isoforms that act as
tumor-suppressors and DN-isoforms that behave as proto-oncogenes. The p53 family 
as a whole behaves as a signaling "network" that integrates developmental,
metabolic and stress signals to control cell metabolism, differentiation,
longevity, proliferation and death. Despite the progress of our knowledge, the
unresolved puzzle of complexity, redundancy and hierarchy in the p53 family
continues to represent a formidable challenge.

<U+2206>N-P63a and TA-P63a exhibit intrinsic differences in transactivation
specificities that depend on distinct features of DNA target sites.

TP63 is a member of the TP53 gene family that encodes for up to ten different TA 
and <U+2206>N isoforms through alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing.
Besides being a master regulator of gene expression for squamous epithelial
proliferation, differentiation and maintenance, P63, through differential
expression of its isoforms, plays important roles in tumorigenesis. All P63
isoforms share an immunoglobulin-like folded DNA binding domain responsible for
binding to sequence-specific response elements (REs), whose overall consensus
sequence is similar to that of the canonical p53 RE. Using a defined assay in
yeast, where P63 isoforms and RE sequences are the only variables, and gene
expression assays in human cell lines, we demonstrated that human TA- and <U+2206>N-P63a
proteins exhibited differences in transactivation specificity not observed with
the corresponding P73 or P53 protein isoforms. These differences 1) were
dependent on specific features of the RE sequence, 2) could be related to
intrinsic differences in their oligomeric state and cooperative DNA binding, and 
3) appeared to be conserved in evolution. Sicen genotoxic stress can change
relative ratio of TA- and <U+2206>N-P63a protein levels, the different transactivation
specificity of each P63 isoform could potentially influence cellular responses to
specific stresses.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs)
significantly change upon ionizing radiation (IR) and play a critical role in
cellular response to IR. Although several radiation responsive miRNAs and their
targets have been identified, little is known about how miRNAs expression and
biogenesis is regulated by IR-caused DNA damage response (DDR). Hence, in this
review, we summarize miRNA expression and biogenesis in cellular response to IR
and mainly elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA expression and biogenesis
from different aspects including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase,
p53/p63/p73 family and other potential factors. Furthermore, we focus on <U+0394>Np73,
which might be a potential regulator of miRNA expression and biogenesis in
cellular response to IR. miRNAs could effectively activate the IR-induced DDR and
modulate the radiation response and cellular radiosensitivity, which have an
important potential clinical application. Therefore, thoroughly understanding the
regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs expression and biogenesis in radiation response
will provide new insights for clinical cancer radiotherapy.

P63 is a p53 family member involved in multiple facets of biology, including
embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, 
senescence and aging. The p63 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms either with 
(TAp63) or without (<U+0394>Np63) the N-terminal transactivation domain. Amounting
evidence suggests that p63 can function as a tumor suppressor, yet the precise
molecular mechanisms, and particularly the specific roles of TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 in
cancer progression, are still largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that <U+0394>Np63a,
the predominant isoform expressed in epithelial cells and squamous cell
carcinomas, inhibits cell invasion. Affymetrix gene expression profiling,
combined with gain- and loss-of-function analyses and chromatin
immunoprecipitation, indicated that cluster of differentiation 82 (CD82), a
documented metastasis suppressor, is a direct transcriptional target of <U+0394>Np63a.
Expression of <U+0394>Np63a inhibited outgrowth in Matrigel and cancer cell invasion,
which was largely reversed by specific ablation of CD82. Conversely, <U+0394>Np63a
knockdown led to increased cell invasion, which was reversed by ectopic
expression of CD82. Moreover, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß)
by either pharmacological inhibitors or by RNA interference resulted in the
downregulation of <U+0394>Np63a and CD82 expression, concomitant with increased cell
invasion, independently of ß-catenin. Furthermore, decreased expression of p63
and CD82 is correlated with cancer progression. Taken together, this study
reveals that <U+0394>Np63a upregulates CD82 to inhibit cell invasion, and suggests that 
GSK3ß can regulate cell invasion by modulating the <U+0394>Np63a-CD82 axis.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
is a CD30-positive T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that morphologically resembles
ALK-positive ALCL but lacks chromosomal rearrangements of the ALK gene. The
genetic and clinical heterogeneity of ALK-negative ALCL has not been delineated. 
We performed immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization on 73
ALK-negative ALCLs and 32 ALK-positive ALCLs and evaluated the associations among
pathology, genetics, and clinical outcome. Chromosomal rearrangements of DUSP22
and TP63 were identified in 30% and 8% of ALK-negative ALCLs, respectively. These
rearrangements were mutually exclusive and were absent in ALK-positive ALCLs.
Five-year overall survival rates were 85% for ALK-positive ALCLs, 90% for
DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs, 17% for TP63-rearranged ALCLs, and 42% for cases lacking
all 3 genetic markers (P < .0001). Hazard ratios for death in these 4 groups
after adjusting for International Prognostic Index and age were 1.0 (reference
group), 0.58, 8.63, and 4.16, respectively (P = 7.10 × 10(-5)). These results
were similar when restricted to patients receiving anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, as well as to patients not receiving stem cell transplantation.
Thus, ALK-negative ALCL is a genetically heterogeneous disease with widely
disparate outcomes following standard therapy. DUSP22 and TP63 rearrangements may
serve as predictive biomarkers to help guide patient management.

BACKGROUND: The progression of low-risk del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome to acute
myeloid leukemia is increased when associated with mutations of TP53, or with
additional chromosomal abnormalities. However, to date the prognostic impact and 
molecular consequences of these rearrangements were poorly investigated. Single
additional alterations to del(5q) by balanced chromosome rearrangements were
rarely found in myelodysplasia. In particular, balanced alterations involving
TP63 and FOXP1 genes were never reported in the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report on a 79-year woman with an aggressive form of
myelodysplastic syndrome with del(5q), no TP53 mutation, and a novel complex
rearrangement of chromosome 3 in bone marrow cells. Our results revealed that the
FOXP1 and TP63 genes were both relocated along chromosome 3. Strikingly,
immunohistochemistry analysis showed altered protein levels, disclosing that this
rearrangement triggered the expression of FOXP1 and TP63 genes. FOXP1 was also
found activated in other patients with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia,
showing that it is an important, recurrent event.
CONCLUSIONS: We document an apparent role of FOXP1 and TP63, up to now poorly
documented, in the progression of MDS in our patient who is lacking mutations in 
the TP53 tumor suppressor gene normally associated with poor outcome in
myelodysplastic syndrome with 5q-. Finally, our results may suggest a possible
broader role of FOXP1 in the pathogenesis and progression of myelodysplasia and
acute myeloid leukemia.

BACKGROUND: The precise nature of how cell type specific chromatin structures at 
enhancer sites affect gene expression is largely unknown. Here we identified cell
type specific enhancers coupled with gene expression in two different types of
breast epithelial cells, HMEC (normal breast epithelial cells) and MDAMB231
(triple negative breast cancer cell line).
RESULTS: Enhancers were defined by modified neighboring histones [using chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq)] and nucleosome depletion
[using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements followed by
sequencing (FAIRE-seq)]. Histone modifications at enhancers were related to the
expression levels of nearby genes up to 750 kb away. These expression levels were
correlated with enhancer status (poised or active), defined by surrounding
histone marks. Furthermore, about fifty percent of poised and active enhancers
contained nucleosome-depleted regions. We also identified response element motifs
enriched at these enhancer sites that revealed key transcription factors (e.g.
TP63) likely involved in regulating breast epithelial enhancer-mediated gene
expression. By utilizing expression data, potential target genes of more than 600
active enhancers were identified. These genes were involved in proteolysis,
epidermis development, cell adhesion, mitosis, cell cycle, and DNA replication.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings facilitate the understanding of epigenetic regulation
specifically, such as the relationships between regulatory elements and gene
expression and generally, how breast epithelial cellular phenotypes are
determined by cell type specific enhancers.

We conducted imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project of four genome-wide
association studies of lung cancer in populations of European ancestry (11,348
cases and 15,861 controls) and genotyped an additional 10,246 cases and 38,295
controls for follow-up. We identified large-effect genome-wide associations for
squamous lung cancer with the rare variants BRCA2 p.Lys3326X (rs11571833, odds
ratio (OR) = 2.47, P = 4.74 × 10(-20)) and CHEK2 p.Ile157Thr (rs17879961, OR =
0.38, P = 1.27 × 10(-13)). We also showed an association between common variation
at 3q28 (TP63, rs13314271, OR = 1.13, P = 7.22 × 10(-10)) and lung adenocarcinoma
that had been previously reported only in Asians. These findings provide further 
evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and its biological
basis. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that imputation can identify rare 
disease-causing variants with substantive effects on cancer risk from preexisting
genome-wide association study data.

PURPOSE: To compare the morphology of cultured rabbit epithelial sheets and the
expression of stem cells with differentiated cell markers of cultivated
epithelial cells from fresh and cryopreserved limbal and oral mucosal biopsies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six New Zealand white rabbits were divided into two groups
of three, from which limbal and oral mucosal biopsies were taken. Harvested
tissues from each rabbit were brought to immediate cultivation, while another set
of tissues was cryopreserved. Cultivation was performed by the explant culture
technique using human amniotic membrane as a culture substrate, co-culturing with
3T3 fibroblasts and using the air-lifting method. Cells were cultured for three
weeks; then cultured epithelial sheets were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and
examined for expression patterns of p63, keratin 3 (K3) and connexin 43 (Cx43).
Cryopreservation was carried out using the vitrification method. Tissues were
preserved in liquid nitrogen using 25% dimethyl sulfoxide combined with 25%
propylene glycol in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 20% fetal
bovine serum. After two months, the tissues were warmed, cultured and stained
using the same processes as for fresh tissue cultures.
RESULTS: Cultivation of fresh limbal and fresh oral mucosal tissues showed
epithelial stratification, with two to five cell layers. Immunohistochemical
staining showed p63-positive cells in basal and intermediate cell layers. K3
staining was observed in cells in the suprabasal layer, while expression of Cx43 
was scattered throughout all layers of the epithelia. All culture sheets
expressed p63, K3 and Cx43 with the exception of one sheet from the oral mucosal 
culture that was p63-negative. Cultured epithelial sheets from cryopreserved
tissues showed results similar to those from fresh tissue culture.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that cells in cultivated fresh limbal and oral
mucosal tissues had similar morphology to cells in cultivated cryopreserved
limbal and oral mucosal tissues, both containing a heterogeneous population of
cells including stem cells and differentiated cells.

In response to genotoxic stress the TP53 tumour suppressor activates target gene 
expression to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the extent of
DNA damage. These canonical activities can be repressed by TP63 in normal
stratifying epithelia to maintain proliferative capacity or drive proliferation
of squamous cell carcinomas, where TP63 is frequently overexpressed/amplified.
Here we use ChIP-sequencing, integrated with microarray analysis, to define the
genome-wide interplay between TP53 and TP63 in response to genotoxic stress in
normal cells. We reveal that TP53 and TP63 bind to overlapping, but distinct
cistromes of sites through utilization of distinctive consensus motifs and that
TP53 is constitutively bound to a number of sites. We demonstrate that cisplatin 
and adriamycin elicit distinct effects on TP53 and TP63 binding events, through
which TP53 can induce or repress transcription of an extensive network of genes
by direct binding and/or modulation of TP63 activity. Collectively, this results 
in a global TP53-dependent repression of cell cycle progression, mitosis and DNA 
damage repair concomitant with activation of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
canonical target genes. Further analyses reveal that in the absence of genotoxic 
stress TP63 plays an important role in maintaining expression of DNA repair
genes, loss of which results in defective repair.

The p53-related p63 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, which are involved in
a variety of biological activities. p63 protein stability is mainly regulated by 
the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway. Several ubiquitin E3
ligases have been identified and some protein kinases as well as other kinds of
proteins are involved in regulation of p63 protein stability. These regulators
are responsive to diverse extracellular signaling, resulting in changes of the
p63 protein levels and impacting different biological processes.

INTRODUCTION: Germline variants in TP63 have been consistently associated with
several tumors, including bladder cancer, indicating the importance of TP53
pathway in cancer genetic susceptibility. However, variants in other related
genes, including TP53 rs1042522 (Arg72Pro), still present controversial results. 
We carried out an in depth assessment of associations between common germline
variants in the TP53 pathway and bladder cancer risk.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated 184 tagSNPs from 18 genes in 1,058 cases
and 1,138 controls from the Spanish Bladder Cancer/EPICURO Study. Cases were
newly-diagnosed bladder cancer patients during 1998-2001. Hospital controls were 
age-gender, and area matched to cases. SNPs were genotyped in blood DNA using
Illumina Golden Gate and TaqMan assays. Cases were subphenotyped according to
stage/grade and tumor p53 expression. We applied classical tests to assess
individual SNP associations and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator (LASSO)-penalized logistic regression analysis to assess multiple SNPs
simultaneously.
RESULTS: Based on classical analyses, SNPs in BAK1 (1), IGF1R (5), P53AIP1 (1),
PMAIP1 (2), SERINPB5 (3), TP63 (3), and TP73 (1) showed significant associations 
at p-value=0.05. However, no evidence of association, either with overall risk or
with specific disease subtypes, was observed after correction for multiple
testing (p-value=0.8). LASSO selected the SNP rs6567355 in SERPINB5 with 83% of
reproducibility. This SNP provided an OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.21, 95%CI 1.05-1.38,
p-value<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.006, and a corrected p-value<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.5 when controlling for
over-estimation.
DISCUSSION: We found no strong evidence that common variants in the TP53 pathway 
are associated with bladder cancer susceptibility. Our study suggests that it is 
unlikely that TP53 Arg72Pro is implicated in the UCB in white Europeans. SERPINB5
and TP63 variation deserve further exploration in extended studies.

BACKGROUND: Germline apoptosis-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
have been shown to contribute to the risk of developing non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). However, very few studies have looked specifically at
apoptosis-related SNPs in a racially-stratified analysis of white and
African-American women.
METHODS: We examined the risk of developing NSCLC associated with 98 germline
SNPs in 32 apoptosis-related genes among women in a population-based case-control
study from the Detroit metropolitan area. We examined 453 cases of NSCLC and 478 
control subjects. We used an unconditional logistic regression with a dominant
model, stratified by race, and adjusted for age, pack-years smoked, ever/never
smoking status, family history of lung cancer, history of COPD, BMI and
education.
RESULTS: Our logistic regression identified 3 significant apoptosis-related SNPs 
in whites (APAF-1, rs1007573; CD40 rs3765459, and CD40 rs1535045), and 7
significant SNPs (ATM, rs1801516; BAK1, rs513349; TNF, rs1800629; TP63,
rs6790167; TP63, rs7613791, TP63, rs35592567 and TP63, rs3856775) in
African-Americans. In a downstream analysis, these SNPs were further prioritized 
utilizing the False Positive Report Percentage (FPRP) methodology and backwards
elimination. In whites, APAF-1 (rs1007573), CD40 (rs3765459) and CD40 (rs1535045)
were all found to be significant by FPRP. In African-Americans, TP63 SNPs
rs6790167 and rs7613791 were found to have a significant FPRP. In parallel, a
backward elimination procedure was used on the 3 significant SNPs in whites and 7
significant SNPs in African-Americans. This procedure identified APAF-1 rs1007573
(OR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.17-2.95) and CD40 rs1535045 (OR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.40-0.84) as
significant independent predictors of risk among whites, and ATM rs1801516
(OR=24.15, 95% CI: 3.50-166.55), TNF rs1800629 (OR= 0.42, 95% CI: 0.18-0.99) and 
TP63 rs6790167 (OR: 2.85, 95% CI: 1.33-6.09) as significant, independent
predictors in African-Americans.
CONCLUSION: In whites, only SNPs APAF-1 rs1007573 and CD40 rs1535045 were
significant by both FPRP and backwards elimination, while in African-Americans,
only TP63 rs6790167 was significant by both methodologies. Thus, we have
identified three promising variants associated with increased risk of NSCLC that 
warrant additional investigation in future studies.

A panel of immunohistochemical markers may be used to differentiate between
pagetoid Bowen disease (PBD) and primary extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) in
selected cases. Although diffuse staining with cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CAM5.2,
carcinoembryonic antigen, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and gross cystic
disease fluid protein 15 generally supports diagnosis of EMPD, cases have been
reported where PBD also expressed CK7, EMA, and CAM5.2. Based on these findings, 
some authors suggested that the 2 entities may arise from the same multipotent
stem cell, capable of further differentiation toward squamous and secretory
lines. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has never been investigated by
comparing PBD and EMPD at the ultrastructural level. We performed the first
ultrastructural study of a case of PBD exhibiting common immunohistochemical
features with EMPD. The lesion displayed some ultrastructural features often
observed in Bowen disease and some that are typically found in EMPD. These
findings indicate the presence of a bidirectional differentiation--secretory and 
squamous--within the same lesion, thus supporting the hypothesis that PBD and
primary EMPD may arise from a common progenitor cell.

AIM: To develop a reference standard and potency assay for Real Architecture For 
3D Tissues (RAFT) tissue equivalents intended for use in limbal epithelial stem
cell (LESC) therapy for the cornea.
METHODS: RAFT, a cell-seeded plastic compressed collagen construct with LESCs
cultured on the surface, was manufactured with the goal of achieving GMP
compliance. RAFTs were tested for reproducibility of manufacture (reference
standard) and subsequently wounded and monitored for re-epithelialization
(potency assay).
RESULTS: RAFT tissue equivalents produced with cells from different biological
donors were capable of supporting multilayered epithelium in culture. The potency
assay demonstrated re-epithelialization following wounding, indicating the
potential efficacy of RAFT constructs.
CONCLUSION: We have presented our attempts at creating a reference standard and
potency assay for the clinical manufacture of RAFT for the treatment of LESC
deficiency. However, it remains challenging for adult stem cell therapies
(including LESC therapy) to fully meet regulatory requirements when dealing with 
a limited source of autologous cells with inherent biological variation between
donors.

The histopathologic distinction between primary adnexal carcinomas and metastatic
adenocarcinoma to the skin from sites such as the breast, lung, and others often 
presents a diagnostic dilemma. Current markers of diagnostic utility include p63 
and cytokeratin 5/6; however, their expression has been demonstrated in 11% to
22% and 27% of cutaneous metastases, respectively. Furthermore, the
immunoreactivity of p40 and GATA3 in various cutaneous adnexal carcinomas has not
been previously reported. In the present study, we compared the expression of
p40, p63, cytokeratin 5/6, and GATA3 in a total of 143 cases, including 67
primary adnexal carcinomas and 76 cutaneous metastases. p40, p63, cytokeratin
5/6, and GATA3 expression was observed in 80%, 84%, 86%, and 47% of primary
adnexal carcinoma, respectively, and in 8%, 17%, 26%, and 40% of cutaneous
metastases, respectively. <U+03C7>(2) Analysis revealed statistically significant P
values (<.0001) for p40, p63, and cytokeratin 5/6 in distinguishing primary
adnexal carcinoma from cutaneous metastases. In summary, while p63 and
cytokeratin 5/6 have similar sensitivity (84% and 86%, respectively) in detecting
primary adnexal carcinomas, p40 appeared to be the most specific marker (92%)
with the best positive predictive value (90%). Since breast and lung are the most
common sites of origin for cutaneous metastases, p40 is the best distinguishing
marker in these settings. None of the four studied markers (p40, p63, cytokeratin
5/6, and GATA3) are helpful in distinguishing between primary adnexal carcinomas 
from cutaneous metastases of salivary gland or bladder malignancies.

Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma is an uncommon but distinctive manifestation
of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma occurs in adults 
and children and can cause diagnostic problems, especially in small biopsies. Few
studies have characterized the histologic and immunophenotypic features of
pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma. t(11;19)(q21;p13) is considered
disease-defining for mucoepidermoid carcinoma; its significance in pulmonary
mucoepidermoid carcinoma warrants further study. Forty three pulmonary
mucoepidermoid carcinomas were re-reviewed and graded according to the Brandwein 
grading system for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Four cases were excluded because of 
a split opinion between pathology report and re-review. These cases were negative
for MAML2 rearrangement by FISH. TTF-1, napsin A, p40 and p63 immunostains were
scored: 0 (negative), 1 (1-25% tumor cells), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%) or 4 (>75%). 
FISH to detect MAML2 rearrangement used a MAML2-11q21 break-apart probe. Thirty
nine pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (4 low, 30 intermediate, 5 high grade)
contained mucous, epidermoid and intermediate cells and lacked keratinization and
in situ carcinoma of the overlying epithelium. All cases with available gross
description (n=22) had a central/endo- or peribronchial location. All 25 cases
tested for immunohistochemistry were positive (scores 1-4) for p63; 23 also
expressed p40. In six cases, the p63 score was higher than p40. TTF-1 and napsin 
were uniformly negative in all 25 cases. MAML2 rearrangement was identified by
FISH in each of the 24 cases tested (3 low, 19 intermediate, 2 high grade).
Clinical history was available in 29 patients (15 men) (median age, 48 years)
with follow-up in 24 (median, 8.4 years). Five patients died of unrelated causes;
one developed metastatic pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma. In conclusion,
features helpful in distinguishing pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma from other 
lung cancers include its central/endo- or peribronchial location together with
the presence of mucous cells, p63 expression, lack of keratinization and MAML2
rearrangement. TTF-1 and napsin are typically not expressed.

Beside a role in normal development/differentiation, high p63 immunoreactivity is
also frequently observed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Due to the complexity 
of the gene, the role of each p63 isotype in tumorigenesis is still confusing.
Constitutively produced or induced in inflammatory conditions, human
beta-defensins (HßDs) are cationic peptides involved in host defenses against
bacteria, viruses and fungi. Here, we investigated both the role of p63 proteins 
in the regulation of HßDs and the implication of these antimicrobial peptides in 
tumor (lymph)angiogenesis. Thus, in contrast to TAp63 isotypes, we observed that 
<U+0394>Np63 proteins (a, ß, <U+03B3>) induce HßD1, 2 and 4 expression. Similar results were
observed in cancer tissues and cell lines. We next demonstrated that
<U+0394>Np63-overexpressing SCC are associated with both a poor prognosis and a high
tumor vascularisation and lymphangiogenesis. Moreover, we showed that HßDs exert 
a chemotactic activity for (lymphatic) endothelial cells in a CCR6-dependent
manner. The ability of HßDs to enhance (lymph)angiogenesis in vivo was also
evaluated. We observed that HßDs increase the vessel number and induce a
significant increase in relative vascular area compared to negative control.
Taken together, the results of this study suggest that <U+0394>Np63-regulated HßD could 
promote tumor (lymph)angiogenesis in SCC microenvironment.

Multiple observations suggest a cell type-specific role for TP53 in mammary
epithelia. We developed an in vitro assay, in which primary mouse mammary
epithelial cells (mMECs) progressed from lumenal to basal-like phenotypes based
on expression of Krt18 or <U+0394>Np63, respectively. Such transition was markedly
delayed in Trp53(-/-) mMECs suggesting that Trp53 is required for specification
of the basal, but not lumenal cells. Evidence from human basal-like cell lines
suggests that TP53 may support the activity of <U+0394>Np63 by preventing its
translocation from nucleoplasm into nucleoli. In human lumenal cells, activation 
of TP53 by inhibiting MDM2 or BRCA1 restored the nucleoplasmic expression of
<U+0394>Np63. Trp53(-/-) mMECs eventually lost epithelial features resulting in
upregulation of MDM2 and translocation of <U+0394>Np63 into nucleoli. We propose that
TP63 may contribute to TP53-mediated oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells
and shed light on tissue- and cell type-specific biases observed for TP53-related
cancers.

INTRODUCTION: The report of cases of lung squamous cell cancers harboring
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements raises the question whether 
this histologic subtype should be also evaluated for such molecular predictive
test.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 40 lung pure squamous cell carcinomas were
analyzed for ALK gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Squamous
differentiation was validated using an immunohistochemical panel including n-p63 
(p40), cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, sex-determining region Y (SRY)-Box2 (SOX2), thyroid 
transcription factor 1, CK7, and Napsin-A.
RESULTS: Squamous differentiation was confirmed in all tumors as they stained
positive for n-p63 and CK5/6 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 and 
Napsin-A. One of 40 cases (2.5%) showed an ALK rearrangement on fluorescence in
situ hybridization analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: ALK translocation may be found in lung pure squamous cell
carcinomas. Our data suggest the opportunity to test ALK rearrangements on biopsy
samples harboring squamous cell cancer differentiation.

Squamous-cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) represents a heterogeneous
disease entity, with various etiological factors implicated in the genesis of
distinct molecular subsets of tumors, which exhibit different biological and
clinical behavior. Treatment of SCCHN is expected to change in the next decade as
targeted therapies continue to make strides. Recently, next-generation sequencing
studies conducted on ~190 SCCHN specimens shed light into the molecular
pathogenesis of the disease. These studies discovered mutations in genes involved
in the differentiation program of squamous epithelium and the Notch/p63 axis
(such as NOTCH1, TP63 and FBXW7), and validated genetic alterations derived from 
previous studies (such as mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, CCND1 and HRAS) as
driver genetic events in SCCHN neoplastic transformation. More recently,
comprehensive data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project on 306 SCCHN
specimens provided further insight into SCCHN inherent molecular complexity,
identifying novel significantly mutated genes, including FAT1, MLL2, TGFRBR2,
HLA-A, NFE2l2 and CASP8. In this article, we provide an overview of the
mutational spectrum of SCCHN, with emphasis on the clinical implementation of
this knowledge. We also discuss the potential integration of new data within the 
framework of precision cancer medicine.

p63 is a member of the p53 protein family and plays a crucial role in epithelial 
development. p63 is expressed in many types of tumors including esophageal
cancer; however, its function in cancer is controversial and its role in
esophageal cancer has not been clearly established. In the present study, we
aimed to identify the mechanisms by which p63 promotes proliferation of
esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. Four human esophageal cancer cell lines
(TE-8, TE-12, BE3 and OE33) were used in this study. We found that <U+0394>Np63 was the 
predominantly expressed p63 isoform in esophageal squamous cancer cells.
Silencing of p63 mRNA in the esopha-geal cancer cell lines TE-8 and TE-12
resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner. A colony formation assay also showed that colony formation by TE-8 and
TE-12 cells was significantly inhibited by p63 siRNA. Furthermore, p63 siRNA
significantly suppressed p-Akt and induced Akt expression in esophageal squamous 
carcinoma cell lines. On the other hand, overexpression of p63 in the esophageal 
cell lines BE3 and OE33 increased p-Akt expression. Silencing of p63 in TE-8 and 
TE-12 cell lines induced p53 and p27 expression and suppressed cyclin D1 and
cyclin E1 expression, whereas overexpression of p63 in BE3 and OE33 cell lines
resulted in decreased levels of p53 and p27 and increased levels of cyclin D1 and
cyclin E1. Taken together, our results suggest that p63 may play a pivotal role
in the progression of esophageal squamous carcinoma cells through regulation of
the cell cycle via the Akt signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: GATA3 (GATA-binding protein 3) expression in urothelial carcinoma
(UC) and mammary carcinomas has been recently reported. However, to the authors' 
knowledge, studies examining GATA3 staining of metastatic UC (MUC) in cytology
specimens are lacking. Delta Np63 (p40) has been shown to be expressed highly
selectively in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) but the literature concerning the 
expression of p40 in UC is limited and controversial. In the current study, the
authors evaluated the usefulness of GATA3 and p40 in the diagnosis of MUC in
cytology specimens.
METHODS: Thirty-two MUC cytology cases and 44 controls (22 UC cases and 22 SCC
cases) were stained for GATA3, p40, and p63 and nuclear staining intensity and
the percentage of positive cells were recorded and compared.
RESULTS: MUC cytology cases stained positive for GATA3, p40, and p63 in 78.13%,
80.65%, and 61.29% of cases, respectively, with moderate/strong staining
intensity. MUC cases had a significantly higher percentage of GATA3 positivity
compared with SCC controls (P<.001), but GATA3 positivity was not found to be
significantly different from UC controls (90.91%) (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.28). For p40 positivity, 
there was no significant difference observed between MUC cases, UC controls
(95.45%), and SCC controls (90.91%) (P=.29). p63 positivity was found to be
significantly lower in MUC cases compared with UC controls (95.45%) and SCC
controls (95.45%) (P<.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that GATA3 is useful in
confirming the diagnosis of MUC in cytology specimens and in distinguishing
between MUC and SCC. p40 is a valuable adjunct to GATA3 in the diagnosis of MUC
in cytology specimens, especially when SCC is not part of the clinical
differential diagnosis.

p63 protein is widely used to identify myoepithelial cells in breast disease.
There have been no comparative studies of the p63 antibodies which detect
different isoforms. In this study, we examine the expression profiles of p63
protein in benign proliferative diseases and malignant tumors of the breast using
pan-p63 and p40 antibodies, and analyze their diagnostic utility and clinical
implications. We selected 32 adenoses, 34 intraductal papillomas, 31 ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 257 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and 36 metaplastic
carcinomas, and created tissue microarray blocks from them. Immunohistochemical
assays for p63 protein were performed on these samples. We investigated the
expression patterns of the pan-p63 (TP63, 4A4, Dako, 1:700), p40 antibody [5-17, 
CalBiochem/EMD Biosciences, 1:2000, p40 (CB)], and p40 antibody [polyclonal,
Diagnostic BioSystems, 1:100, p40 (DB)] in various forms of breast disease. We
determined that p63 and p40 (DB) expression in myoepithelial cells was broadly
similar and showed cognate clinicopathologic features, unlike p40 (CB). p40 (CB) 
was more sensitive (99.0%) but less specific (85.8%), and p63 was less sensitive 
(93.8%) in adenosis, IP, and DCIS. In IDCs, p63 and p40 (DB) had similar
expression in cancer cells; p40 (CB) expression, however, was statistically
different. In metaplastic carcinomas, both p63 and p40 (DB) had distinct
expression profiles, according to their histologic subtypes. We conclude that p40
antibodies as well as pan-p63 antibody are specific and sensitive myoepithelial
cell markers. Interpretation of p40 positivity in cancer cells, however, should
be considered carefully, due to their relatively lower specificity.

The p53 family (p53, p63 and p73) is intimately linked with an overwhelming
number of cellular processes during normal physiological as well as pathological 
conditions including cancer. The fact that these proteins are expressed in myriad
isoforms, each with unique biochemical properties and distinct effects on
tumorigenesis, complicates their study. A case in point is Squamous Cell
Carcinoma (SCC) where p53 is often mutated and the <U+0394>Np63 isoform is
overexpressed. Given that p53 and p63 can hetero-dimerize, bind to quite similar 
DNA elements and share common co-factors, any alterations in their individual
expression levels, activity and/or mutation can severely disrupt the family
equilibrium. The burgeoning genomics data sets and new additions to the
experimental toolbox are offering crucial insights into the complex role of the
p53 family in SCC, but more mechanistic studies are needed.

PURPOSE: Prior studies have demonstrated tumor-specific alternative splicing
events in various solid tumor types. The role of alternative splicing in the
development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is
unclear. Our study queried exon-level expression to implicate splice variants in 
HNSCC tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a comparative genome-wide analysis of 44 HNSCC 
tumors and 25 uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) tissue samples at an exon
expression level. In our comparison we ranked genes based upon a novel score-the 
Maximum-Minimum Exon Score (MMES)--designed to predict the likelihood of an
alternative splicing event occurring. We validated predicted alternative splicing
events using quantitative RT-PCR on an independent cohort.
RESULTS: After MMES scoring of 17,422 genes, the top 900 genes with the highest
scores underwent additional manual inspection of expression patterns in a
graphical analysis. The genes LAMA3, DST, VEGFC, SDHA, RASIP1, and TP63 were
selected for further validation studies because of a high frequency of
alternative splicing suggested in our graphical analysis, and literature review
showing their biological relevance and known splicing patterns. We confirmed TP63
as having dominant expression of the short DeltaNp63 isoform in HNSCC tumor
samples, consistent with prior reports. Two of the six genes (LAMA3 and DST)
validated by quantitative RT-PCR for tumor-specific alternative splicing events
(Student's t test, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Alternative splicing events of oncologically relevant proteins occur 
in HNSCC. The number of genes expressing tumor-specific splice variants needs
further elucidation, as does the functional significance of selective isoform
expression.

Lung development is determined by the coordinated expression of several key
genes. Previously, we and others have shown the importance of the sex determining
region Y-box 2 (Sox2) gene in lung development. Transgenic expression of Sox2
during lung development resulted in cystic airways, and here we show that
modulating the timing of ectopic Sox2 expression in the branching regions of the 
developing lung results in variable cystic lesions resembling the spectrum of the
human congenital disorder congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM). Sox2
dominantly differentiated naive epithelial cells into the proximal lineage
irrespective of the presence of Fgf10. Sox2 directly induced the expression of
Trp63, the master switch toward the basal cell lineage and induced the expression
of Gata6, a factor involved in the emergence of bronchoalveolar stem cells. We
showed that SOX2 and TRP63 are coexpressed in the lungs of human patients with
type II CCAM. The combination of premature differentiation toward the proximal
cell lineage and the induction of proliferation resulted in the cyst-like
structures. Thus, we show that Sox2 is directly responsible for the emergence of 
two lung progenitor cells: basal cells by regulating the master gene Trp63 and
bronchoalveolar stem cells by regulating Gata6.

Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a rare
monogenetic disorder that is characterized by severe abnormalities in
ectoderm-derived tissues, such as skin and its appendages. A major cause of
morbidity among affected infants is severe and chronic skin erosions. Currently, 
supportive care is the only available treatment option for AEC patients.
Mutations in TP63, a gene that encodes key regulators of epidermal development,
are the genetic cause of AEC. However, it is currently not clear how mutations in
TP63 lead to the various defects seen in the patients' skin. In this review, we
will discuss current knowledge of the AEC disease mechanism obtained by studying 
patient tissue and genetically engineered mouse models designed to mimic aspects 
of the disorder. We will then focus on new approaches to model AEC, including the
use of patient cells and stem cell technology to replicate the disease in a human
tissue culture model. The latter approach will advance our understanding of the
disease and will allow for the development of new in vitro systems to identify
drugs for the treatment of skin erosions in AEC patients. Further, the use of
stem cell technology, in particular induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), will
enable researchers to develop new therapeutic approaches to treat the disease

Most p53 mutations in human cancers are missense mutations resulting in a
full-length mutant p53 protein. Besides losing tumor suppressor activity, some
hotspot p53 mutants gain oncogenic functions. This effect is mediated in part,
through gene expression changes due to inhibition of p63 and p73 by mutant p53 at
their target gene promoters. Here, we report that the tumor suppressor microRNA
let-7i is downregulated by mutant p53 in multiple cell lines expressing
endogenous mutant p53. In breast cancer patients, significantly decreased let-7i 
levels were associated with missense mutations in p53. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and promoter luciferase assays established let-7i as a
transcriptional target of mutant p53 through p63. Introduction of let-7i to
mutant p53 cells significantly inhibited migration, invasion and metastasis by
repressing a network of oncogenes including E2F5, LIN28B, MYC and NRAS. Our
findings demonstrate that repression of let-7i expression by mutant p53 has a key
role in enhancing migration, invasion and metastasis.

OBJECTIVE: Biopsy confirmed that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) may
naturally regress or progress. Currently, the risk assessment for CIN progression
to cervical cancer is still not satisfactory in clinical practice. We
investigated copy number and protein expression of TP63 and MYC and explored the 
possibility to use them as progression biomarkers.
METHODS: Copy numbers of TP63 and MYC, as well as human papilloma virus (HPV)
integration status, were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 39
patients with CIN and 66 patients with cervical cancer. Corresponding protein
expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Receiver operating
characteristic curves were used to measure the diagnostic test performance for
the detection of cervical cancer from CIN. Sensitivity and specificity values of 
biomarkers were calculated.
RESULTS: The average copy number and expression of TP63 and MYC, as well as the
HPV integration rate, increased in the progression of CIN to cervical cancer.
Receiver operating characteristic analysis for detection of cervical cancer
resulted in area under the curve (AUC) values of TP63 copy number (AUC, 0.96; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.00), MYC copy number (AUC, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.85-0.96), TP63 expression (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85), and HPV-16
integration (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). MYC expression was not able to
statistically distinguish cancer from CIN (P = 0.393). The combinations increased
the specificity slightly but not sensitivity. Among them, TP63 amplification
showed the best diagnostic performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Amplification and overexpression of TP63 and MYC, and HPV
integration rate, are associated with the transition of CIN to cervical cancer.
Future studies on these biomarkers will help to assess the risk of CIN
progression.

p63 is a transcriptional factor belonging to p53 family of genes. Beside the role
in cancer, partially shared with p53 and the other member p73, p63 also plays
exclusive roles in development and homeostasis of ectodermal/epidermal-related
organs. Here we show that p63 transcriptionally controls the expression of the
matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13). p63 binds a p53-like responsive element in
the human promoter of MMP13, thus promoting the activation of its transcription. 
The catalytic activity of MMP13 is required in high invasion capacity of
metastatic cancer cells, however, although p63 and MMP13 expression correlates in
cancer patients, their co-expression does not predict cancer patient survival.
Our results demonstrate that p63 directly controls MMP13 expression.

Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2), a calcium signal
transducer, is universally expressed in stratified squamous epithelia of many
organs, including skin, esophagus and cervix. Although TACSTD2, was reported to
be overexpressed in many epithelial tumors, which has increased interest in using
it as a molecular target for cancer therapy, the role of TACSTD2 in
carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is largely unclear and
controversial. To explore the role of TACSTD2, temporal-spatial expression of
TACSTD2 was analyzed in both normal and SCC tissues. Our data demonstrate that
Tacstd2 expression and membrane localization are tightly associated with
stratified epithelial homeostasis, while loss of TACSTD2 was identified in poorly
differentiated SCC tissues collected from cervix, esophagus, head and neck.
Gradual loss of TACSTD2 was correlated with stepwise progression of SCC.
Consistent with these in vivo observations, our data show that inhibition of
Tacstd2 expression significantly inhibited chemotherapeutic reagent-induced
apoptosis, and TACSTD2 regulated apoptotic gene expression through P63 containing
the transactivation domain (TAp63). These findings indicated that loss of TACSTD2
could promote SCC progression and treatment resistance through attenuating
chemotherapeutic reagent-induced apoptosis through TAp63, and TACSTD2 could be
used as a marker for pathological grading of SCC.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy
worldwide, and patient outcomes using current treatments remain poor. Tumor
development is etiologically associated with tobacco or alcohol use and/or human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-positive HNSCCs, which frequently harbor
wild-type p53, carry a more favorable prognosis and are a biologically distinct
subgroup when compared with their HPV-negative counterparts. HPV E7 induces
expression of the human DEK gene, both in vitro and in vivo. In keratinocytes,
DEK overexpression is sufficient for causing oncogenic phenotypes in the absence 
of E7. Conversely, DEK loss results in cell death in HPV-positive cervical cancer
cells at least in part through p53 activation, and Dek knockout mice are
relatively resistant to the development of chemically induced skin papillomas.
Despite the established oncogenic role of DEK in HPV-associated cervical cancer
cell lines and keratinocytes, a functional role of DEK has not yet been explored 
in HNSCC. Using an established transgenic mouse model of HPV16 E7-induced HNSCC, 
we demonstrate that Dek is required for optimal proliferation of E7-transgenic
epidermal cells and for the growth of HNSCC tumors. Importantly, these studies
also demonstrate that DEK protein is universally upregulated in both HPV-positive
and -negative human HNSCC tumors relative to adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore,
DEK knockdown inhibited the proliferation of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC
cells, establishing a functional role for DEK in human disease. Mechanistic
studies reveal that attenuated HNSCC cell growth in response to DEK loss was
associated with reduced expression of the oncogenic p53 family member, <U+0394>Np63.
Exogenous <U+0394>Np63 expression rescued the proliferative defect in the absence of
DEK, thereby establishing a functional DEK-<U+0394>Np63 oncogenic pathway that promotes 
HNSCC. Taken together, our data demonstrate that DEK stimulates HNSCC cellular
growth and identify <U+0394>Np63 as a novel DEK effector.

p63 is an important regulator of epithelial development expressed in different
variants containing (TA) or lacking (<U+0394>N) the N-terminal transactivation domain.
The different isoforms regulate stem-cell renewal and differentiation as well as 
cell senescence. Several studies indicate that p63 isoforms also play a role in
cancer development; however, very little is known about the role played by p63 in
regulating the cancer stem phenotype. Here we investigate the cellular signals
regulated by TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 in a model of epithelial cancer stem cells. To this 
end, we used colon cancer stem cells, overexpressing either TAp63 or <U+0394>Np63
isoforms, to carry out a proteomic study by chemical-labeling approach coupled to
network analysis. Our results indicate that p63 is implicated in a wide range of 
biological processes, including metabolism. This was further investigated by a
targeted strategy at both protein and metabolite levels. The overall data show
that TAp63 overexpressing cells are more glycolytic-active than <U+0394>Np63 cells,
indicating that the two isoforms may regulate the key steps of glycolysis in an
opposite manner. The mass-spectrometry proteomics data of the study have been
deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (
http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org ) via the PRIDE partner repository
with data set identifiers PXD000769 and PXD000768.

BACKGROUND: TAp63 is a tumour-suppressor protein that is often underexpressed in 
various types of cancer. It has been shown to activate gene transcription
depending on the transcription domain and to be closely related with metastasis. 
In this study, we demonstrate that TAp63 suppresses metastasis in colon cancer
cells through microRNA-133b.
METHODS: We evaluated the correlation of TAp63 and miR-133b with HT-29 and SW-620
cells and investigated the roles of TAp63 in the expression of RhoA, E-cadherin
and vimentin. We further investigated the roles of TAp63-mediated invasion and
migration of colon cancer cells.
RESULTS: TAp63 expression is downregulated in colon cancer, and microRNA-133b is 
a transcriptional target of TAp63. Furthermore, microRNA-133b is essential for
the inhibitory effects of TAp63 on RhoA, E-cadherin and vimentin. Moreover, TAp63
inhibits cell migration and invasion through microRNA-133b. Correspondingly, the 
inhibitory effect of TAp63 on RhoA, E-cadherin, vimentin, migration and invasion 
can be blocked by the microRNA-133b inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: TAp63 and microRNA-133b were able to suppress the metastasis of
colon cancer. Both TAp63 and microRNA-133b may be potential biomarkers for
diagnosis in colon cancer metastasis and may provide unique therapeutic targets
for this common malignancy.

The transcription factor SOX2 is an essential regulator of pluripotent stem cells
and promotes development and maintenance of squamous epithelia. We previously
reported that SOX2 is an oncogene and subject to highly recurrent genomic
amplification in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Here, we have further
characterized the function of SOX2 in SCC. Using ChIP-seq analysis, we compared
SOX2-regulated gene profiles in multiple SCC cell lines to ES cell profiles and
determined that SOX2 binds to distinct genomic loci in SCCs. In SCCs, SOX2
preferentially interacts with the transcription factor p63, as opposed to the
transcription factor OCT4, which is the preferred SOX2 binding partner in ES
cells. SOX2 and p63 exhibited overlapping genomic occupancy at a large number of 
loci in SCCs; however, coordinate binding of SOX2 and p63 was absent in ES cells.
We further demonstrated that SOX2 and p63 jointly regulate gene expression,
including the oncogene ETV4, which was essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell
survival. Together, these findings demonstrate that the action of SOX2 in SCC
differs substantially from its role in pluripotency. The identification of the
SCC-associated interaction between SOX2 and p63 will enable deeper
characterization the downstream targets of this interaction in SCC and normal
squamous epithelial physiology.

PURPOSE: This article aims to report a case of known ectrodactyly ectodermal
dysplasia in a young male patient who subsequently was found to have a retinal
tear and localized retinal detachment.
CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a 22-year-old white male patient with a
history of ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia. Our patient initially presented
with an acute exacerbation of bilateral, red, irritated eyes. No recent changes
in vision were reported. The patient's ocular surface disease was consistent with
ectrodermal dysplasia syndrome. However, a dilated fundus examination revealed an
asymptomatic retinal tear with a surrounding localized retinal detachment.
CONCLUSIONS: In this case, the patient presented with longstanding ocular surface
disease known to be associated with this patient's inherited ectoderm disorder.
In addition, this patient revealed a retinal tear, raising the possibility that
patients with inherited congenital ectodermal dysplasia could be at risk for
damaged structures originating from the neural ectoderm. In this heterogeneous
disease, we are contributing to the existing literature a case of ectodermal
dysplasia syndrome with obvious ectodermal complications that also had retinal
findings leading us to speculate question if neural ectoderm could also be
involved in this inherited disease.

S100A2 is a BRCA1/p63 coregulated tumour suppressor gene with roles in the
regulation of mutant p53 stability.

Here, we show for the first time that the familial breast/ovarian cancer
susceptibility gene, BRCA1, along with interacting <U+0394>Np63 proteins,
transcriptionally upregulate the putative tumour suppressor protein, S100A2. Both
BRCA1 and <U+0394>Np63 proteins are required for S100A2 expression. BRCA1 requires <U+0394>Np63
proteins for recruitment to the S100A2 proximal promoter region, while exogenous 
expression of individual <U+0394>Np63 proteins cannot activate S100A2 transcription in
the absence of a functional BRCA1. Consequently, mutation of the <U+0394>Np63/p53
response element within the S100A2 promoter completely abrogates the ability of
BRCA1 to upregulate S100A2. S100A2 shows growth control features in a range of
cell models. Transient or stable exogenous S100A2 expression inhibits the growth 
of BRCA1 mutant and basal-like breast cancer cell lines, while short interfering 
RNA (siRNA) knockdown of S100A2 in non-tumorigenic cells results in enhanced
proliferation. S100A2 modulates binding of mutant p53 to HSP90, which is required
for efficient folding of mutant p53 proteins, by competing for binding to
HSP70/HSP90 organising protein (HOP). HOP is a cochaperone that is required for
the efficient transfer of proteins from HSP70 to HSP90. Loss of S100A2 leads to
an HSP90-dependent stabilisation of mutant p53 with a concomitant loss of p63.
Accordingly, S100A2-deficient cells are more sensitive to the HSP-90 inhibitor,
17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, potentially representing a novel
therapeutic strategy for S100A2- and BRCA1-deficient cancers. Taken together,
these data demonstrate the importance of S100A2 downstream of the BRCA1/<U+0394>Np63
signalling axis in modulating transcriptional responses and enforcing growth
control mechanisms through destabilisation of mutant p53.

Mutant p53 proteins (mutp53) often acquire oncogenic activities, conferring drug 
resistance and/or promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. Although it has
been well established that such a gain of function is mainly achieved through
interaction with transcriptional regulators, thereby modulating cancer-associated
gene expression, how the mutp53 function is regulated remains elusive. Here we
report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) bound common mutp53 (e.g.
R175H and R273H) and, subsequently, suppressed their oncogenic activities. ATF3
repressed mutp53-induced NFKB2 expression and sensitized R175H-expressing cancer 
cells to cisplatin and etoposide treatments. Moreover, ATF3 appeared to suppress 
R175H- and R273H-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion as a consequence of 
preventing the transcription factor p63 from inactivation by mutp53. Accordingly,
ATF3 promoted the expression of the metastasis suppressor SHARP1 in
mutp53-expressing cells. An ATF3 mutant devoid of the mutp53-binding domain
failed to disrupt the mutp53-p63 binding and, thus, lost the activity to suppress
mutp53-mediated migration, suggesting that ATF3 binds to mutp53 to suppress its
oncogenic function. In line with these results, we found that down-regulation of 
ATF3 expression correlated with lymph node metastasis in TP53-mutated human lung 
cancer. We conclude that ATF3 can suppress mutp53 oncogenic function, thereby
contributing to tumor suppression in TP53-mutated cancer.

Therapeutic interventions based on metabolic inhibitor-based therapies are
expected to be less prone to acquired resistance. However, there has not been any
study assessing the possibility that the targeting of the tumor cell metabolism
may result in unforeseeable resistance. We recently established a pre-clinical
model of estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were chronically
adapted to grow (> 10 months) in the presence of graded, millimolar
concentrations of the anti-diabetic biguanide metformin, an AMPK agonist/mTOR
inhibitor that has been evaluated in multiple in vitro and in vivo cancer studies
and is now being tested in clinical trials. To assess what impact the phenomenon 
of resistance might have on the metformin-like "dirty" drugs that are able to
simultaneously hit several metabolic pathways, we employed the ingenuity pathway 
analysis (IPA) software to functionally interpret the data from Agilent
whole-human genome arrays in the context of biological processes, networks, and
pathways. Our findings establish, for the first time, that a "global" targeting
of metabolic reprogramming using metformin certainly imposes a great selective
pressure for the emergence of new breast cancer cellular states. Intriguingly,
acquired resistance to metformin appears to trigger a transcriptome reprogramming
toward a metastatic stem-like profile, as many genes encoding the components of
the degradome (KLK11, CTSF, FREM1, BACE-2, CASP, TMPRSS4, MMP16, HTRA1), cancer
cell migration and invasion factors (TP63, WISP2, GAS3, DKK1, BCAR3, PABPC1,
MUC1, SPARCL1, SEMA3B, SEMA6A), stem cell markers (DCLK1, FAK), and key
pro-metastatic lipases (MAGL and Cpla2) were included in the signature. Because
this convergent activation of pathways underlying tumor microenvironment
interactions occurred in low-proliferative cancer cells exhibiting a notable
downregulation of the G 2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulators that maintain genome
stability (CCNB1, CCNB2, CDC20, CDC25C, AURKA, AURKB, BUB1, CENP-A, CENP-M) and
pro-autophagic features (i.e., TRAIL upregulation and BCL-2 downregulation), it
appears that the unique mechanism of acquired resistance to metformin has
opposing roles in growth and metastatic dissemination. While refractoriness to
metformin limits breast cancer cell growth, likely due to aberrant
mitotic/cytokinetic machinery and accelerated autophagy, it notably increases the
potential of metastatic dissemination by amplifying the number of pro-migratory
and stemness inputs via the activation of a significant number of proteases and
EMT regulators. Future studies should elucidate whether our findings using
supra-physiological concentrations of metformin mechanistically mimic the
ultimate processes that could paradoxically occur in a polyploid,
senescent-autophagic scenario triggered by the chronic metabolic stresses that
occur during cancer development and after treatment with cancer drugs.

The upper airways are lined with a pseudostratified bronchial epithelium that
forms a barrier against unwanted substances in breathing air. The transcription
factor p63, which is important for stratification of skin epithelium, has been
shown to be expressed in basal cells of the lungs and its <U+0394>N isoform is
recognized as a key player in squamous cell lung cancer. However, the role of p63
in formation and maintenance of bronchial epithelia is largely unknown. The
objective of the current study was to determine the expression pattern of the <U+0394>N 
and TA isoforms of p63 and the role of p63 in the development and maintenance of 
pseudostratified lung epithelium in situ and in culture. We used a human
bronchial epithelial cell line with basal cell characteristics (VA10) to model
bronchial epithelium in an air-liquid interface culture (ALI) and performed a
lentiviral-based silencing of p63 to characterize the functional and phenotypic
consequences of p63 loss. We demonstrate that <U+0394>Np63 is the major isoform in the
human lung and its expression was exclusively found in the basal cells lining the
basement membrane of the bronchial epithelium. Knockdown of p63 affected
proliferation and migration of VA10 cells and facilitated cellular senescence.
Expression of p63 is critical for epithelial repair as demonstrated by wound
healing assays. Importantly, generation of pseudostratified VA10 epithelium in
the ALI setup depended on p63 expression and goblet cell differentiation, which
can be induced by IL-13 stimulation, was abolished by the p63 knockdown. After
knockdown of p63 in primary bronchial epithelial cells they did not proliferate
and showed marked senescence. We conclude that these results strongly implicate
p63 in the formation and maintenance of differentiated pseudostratified bronchial
epithelium.

BACKGROUND: Our previous study found unique adenosquamous carcinomas (ADSQs)
containing a mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC)-like component and a characteristic
p63 staining pattern. This study focused on these unique ADSQs.
METHODS: Thirty ADSQ cases were studied histologically and by
immunohistochemistry for TTF-1 and p63. Of these 30 ADSQs, eight were selected as
unique ADSQs. The clinicopathological characteristics of these ADSQs were further
studied, and the gene rearrangement of mammalian mastermind-like 2 (MAML2) was
investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for differentiation
from pulmonary MEC.
RESULTS: The clinicopathological characteristics between the eight ADSQs and the 
other ADSQ cases showed no statistically significant differences, except for
serum CEA level. Histologically, the eight ADSQs contained varying degrees of the
MEC-like component, which consisted of solid nests with mucin-filled cysts or a
cribriform-like structure. Immunohistochemically, p63-positive nuclei
characteristically encircled the tumor nests, although TTF-1 was completely
negative. All unique ADSQs not only had a variable degree of squamous cell
carcinoma component in addition to the MEC-like component, but also contained a
small tubular adenocarcinoma component in three tumors. FISH analysis revealed no
MAML2 gene rearrangement in the eight ADSQs.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the 30 ADSQs investigated in this study, eight contained a
MEC-like component with a characteristic p63 basilar staining pattern similar to 
that of bronchial basal cells. These unique ADSQs shared clinical characteristics
with ordinary ADSQs, but clinicopathologically differed from pulmonary ordinary
MEC. Therefore, these unique ADSQs may be either a novel ADSQ subtype originating
from bronchial epithelium or variant-type MEC.

How the TP53 family proteins TP63 and TP73 contribute to tumorigenesis:
regulators and effectors.

In mammals, the p53 family comprises two additional members, p63 and p73
(hereafter referred to as TP53, TP63, and TP73, respectively). The usage of two
alternative promoters produces protein variants either with (transactivating [TA]
isoforms) or without (<U+0394>N isoforms) the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD).
In general, the TA proteins exert TP53-like tumor-suppressive activities through 
their ability to activate a common set of target genes. The <U+0394>N proteins can act
as dominant-negative inhibitors of the transcriptionally active family members.
Additionally, they possess intrinsic-specific biological activities due to the
presence of alternative TADs, and as a result of engaging a different set of
regulators. This review summarizes the current understanding of upstream
regulators and downstream effectors of the TP53 family proteins, with particular 
emphasis on those that are relevant for their role in tumorigenesis. Furthermore,
we highlight the existence of networks and cross-talks among the TP53 family
members, their modulators, as well as the transcriptional targets.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs, 19-25 nucleotides in length
involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression of great majority 
of the human protein coding genes. Different aspects of cellular activities like 
cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by miRNAs through
their interaction with particular RNA species. In many tumors up or
down-regulation of different miRNAs has been reported. Human miR-17-92 gene
cluster is located on 13q31.3, rooming several miRNAs including miR-17-5p,
miR-17-3p, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-92a. Amplification or overexpression 
of this cluster has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia and several other cancer types. Here, we performed inhibition of miR-92a
in an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line (HL-60) using locked nucleic
acid (LNA) antagomir. In different time points after LNA-anti-miR92a
transfection, MTT assay and annexin/propidium iodide staining were performed.
These assessments indicate that miR-92a inhibition can extensively decrease the
viability of these cells which is mainly due to induction of apoptosis. Western
blot analysis of p63 protein also revealed that miR-92a inhibition resulted in
p63 expression, hence activation of cellular pathways which are normally
controlled by p63 protein are retrieved. These findings could open up a path to
the miRNAs based therapeutic approach for treatment of APL.

BACKGROUND: Several genome-wide association studies on lung cancer (LC) have
reported similar findings of a new susceptibility locus, 3q28. After that, a
number of studies reported that the rs10937405, and rs4488809 polymorphism in
chromosome 3q28 has been implicated in LC risk. However, the studies have yielded
contradictory results.
METHODS: PubMed, ISI web of science, EMBASE and the Chinese National Knowledge
Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to identify relevant
studies. Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A meta-analysis was
performed to examine the association between rs10937405, rs4488809 polymorphism
at 3q28 and susceptibility to LC. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also tested.
RESULTS: A total of 9 studies including 35,961 LC cases and 57,790 controls were 
involved in this meta-analysis. An overall random-effects per-allele OR of1.19
(95% CI: 1.14-1.25; P<10(-5)) and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13-1.25; P<10(-5)) was found
for the rs10937405 and rs4488809 polymorphism respectively. Similar results were 
also observed using dominant or recessive genetic model. After stratified by
ethnicity, significant associations were found among East Asians (per-allele
OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.22, 95% CI: 1.17-1.27; P<10(-5)); whereas no significant associations were
found among Caucasians for rs10937405. In the sub-group analysis by sample size, 
significantly increased risks were found for these polymorphisms in all genetic
models. When analyzed according to histological type, the effects of rs10937405, 
and rs4488809 at 3q28 on the risk of lung cancer were significant mostly for lung
adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that rs10937405-G allele and rs4488809-G
allele might be risk-conferring factors for the development of lung cancer,
especially for East Asian populations.

BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus infection is associated with genesis and
malignant potential of cervical cancer. E6 and E7 oncogens are known to bind to
p53 and retinoblastoma gene products, abrogating their functions as tumor
suppressors, leading to an abnormal cell cycle machinery. Roles of the p53
homolog p63 have also been postulated, E6 expression leading to TAp63b
degradation allowing anchorage independent growth. Molecular studies correlated
with clinicopathological factors are important to determine prognosis and
treatment strategies, but results have been controversial and need to be
clarified.
AIM: To investigate expression of p53 and p63 in cervical squamous cell
carcinomas in correlation with age, FIGO staging, morphology, and cancer cell
proliferation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of p53 and p63 immunohistochemical staining in 
a total of 56 paraffin-embedded tissues of cervical squamous cell carcinomas from
Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Indonesia, was evaluated for correlation with
clinicopathological parameters. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the
percentage of p53 and p63 expression with patient age, FIGO staging and
morphology and to compare mean p53 and p63 expression. The Spearman correlation
test was applied to correlate p53 and p63 expression with that of Ki-67. A
p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: There were significant associations between p53 expression with age
(p=0.019) and FIGO staging (p=0.026), but not with with morphology or Ki-67
expression. There were no links between p63 expression and age, morphology, FIGO 
staging or Ki-67.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that p53 has a prognostic value in cervical
squamous cell carcinomas given the relation with FIGO staging.

Desmosomes are intercellular junctions that provide tissues with structural
stability. These junctions might also act as signaling centers that transmit
environmental clues to the cell, thereby affecting cell differentiation,
migration, and proliferation. The importance of desmosomes is underscored by
devastating skin and heart diseases caused by mutations in desmosomal genes.
Recent observations suggest that abnormal desmosomal protein expression might
indirectly contribute to skin disorders previously not linked to these proteins. 
For example, it has been postulated that reduced desmosomal protein expression
occurs in patients affected by Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft
lip/palate syndrome (AEC), a skin fragility disorder caused by mutations in the
transcription factor TP63. Currently, it is not clear how these changes in
desmosomal gene expression contribute to AEC. We will discuss new approaches that
combine in vitro and in vivo models to elucidate the role of desmosomal gene
deregulation in human skin diseases such as AEC.

Human cell transformation is a key step for oncogenic development, which involves
multiple pathways; however, the mechanism remains unclear. To test our hypothesis
whether cell oncogenic transformation shares some mechanisms with the process of 
reprogramming non-stem cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), we studied
the relationship among the key factors for promoting or inhibiting iPSC in
radiation-transformed human epithelial cell lines derived from different tissues 
(lung, breast and colon). We unexpectedly found that p63 and OCT4 were highly
expressed (accompanied by low expressed p53 and miR-34a) in all transformed cell 
lines examined when compared with their non-transformed counterparts. We further 
elucidated the relationship of these factors: the 3p strand of miR-34a directly
targeted OCT4 by binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of OCT4 and,
OCT4, in turn, stimulated p63 but inhibited p53 expression by binding to a
specific region of the p63 or p53 promoter. Moreover, we revealed that the
effects of OCT4 on promoting cell oncogenic transformation were by affecting p63 
and p53. These results support that a positive loop exists in human cells: OCT4
upregulation as a consequence of inhibition of miR-34a, promotes p63 but
suppresses p53 expression, which further stimulates OCT4 upregulation by
downregulating miR-34a. This functional loop contributes significantly to cell
transformation and, most likely, also to the iPSC process.

The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and the miRNA processing machinery in the
regulation of stem cell biology are not well understood. Here, we show that the
p53 family member and p63 isoform, <U+0394>Np63, is a transcriptional activator of a
cofactor critical for miRNA processing (DGCR8). This regulation gives rise to a
unique miRNA signature resulting in reprogramming cells to multipotency.
Strikingly, <U+0394>Np63(-/-) epidermal cells display profound defects in terminal
differentiation and express a subset of markers and miRNAs present in embryonic
stem cells and fibroblasts induced to pluripotency using Yamanaka factors.
Moreover, <U+0394>Np63(-/-) epidermal cells transduced with an inducible DGCR8 plasmid
can differentiate into multiple cell fates in vitro and in vivo. We found that
human primary keratinocytes depleted of <U+0394>Np63 or DGCR8 can be reprogrammed in 6 d
and express a unique miRNA and gene expression signature that is similar but not 
identical to human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our data reveal a role for
<U+0394>Np63 in the transcriptional regulation of DGCR8 to reprogram adult somatic cells
into multipotent stem cells.

DNA variation in Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) causes Van der Woude
syndrome (VWS), the most common syndromic form of cleft lip and palate (CLP).
However, an etiologic variant in IRF6 has been found in only 70% of VWS families.
To test whether DNA variants in regulatory elements cause VWS, we sequenced three
conserved elements near IRF6 in 70 VWS families that lack an etiologic mutation
within IRF6 exons. A rare mutation (350dupA) was found in a conserved IRF6
enhancer element (MCS9.7) in a Brazilian family. The 350dupA mutation abrogated
the binding of p63 and E47 transcription factors to cis-overlapping motifs, and
significantly disrupted enhancer activity in human cell cultures. Moreover, using
a transgenic assay in mice, the 350dupA mutation disrupted the activation of
MCS9.7 enhancer element and led to failure of lacZ expression in all head and
neck pharyngeal arches. Interestingly, disruption of the p63 Motif1 and/or E47
binding sites by nucleotide substitution did not fully recapitulate the effect of
the 350dupA mutation. Rather, we recognized that the 350dupA created a CAAAGT
motif, a binding site for Lef1 protein. We showed that Lef1 binds to the mutated 
site and that overexpression of Lef1/ß-Catenin chimeric protein repressed
MCS9.7-350dupA enhancer activity. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that
350dupA variant is an etiologic mutation in VWS patients and disrupts enhancer
activity by a loss- and gain-of-function mechanism, and thus support the
rationale for additional screening for regulatory mutations in patients with CLP.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) is a variant of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
characterized by a prominent and sometimes exclusive spindle cell component.
Distinction from a sarcoma or reactive stroma can be problematic, particularly in
cases in which the conventional component is not obvious. The value of
immunohistochemistry is limited because of the loss of cytokeratin expression in 
a sizable percentage of cases. Staining for p63 can enhance detection of
epithelial differentiation, but its usefulness is offset by expression in various
soft tissue proliferations. Staining for p40--a squamous-specific isoform of
p63--could potentially improve diagnostic accuracy. Immunohistochemistry for
pancytokeratin, p63, and p40 was performed on 37 head and neck SCs, 201 soft
tissue neoplasms, and 40 reactive stromal proliferations. The SCs were also
stained for p16 in the event that some of the tumors were human papillomavirus
(HPV) related. HPV in situ hybridization was performed on p16-positive cases.
Twenty-three of 37 (62%) SCs were positive for pancytokeratin, 23 of 37 (62%)
were positive for p63, and 20 of 37 (54%) were positive for p40. Compared with
p63, p40 staining was less likely to be observed in soft tissue tumors (5% vs.
30%) and reactive stromal proliferations (0% vs. 30%). HPV16 was detected in 3 of
10 (30%) SCs of the oropharynx but in none of the nonoropharyngeal SCs. p40
staining does not improve the sensitivity for diagnosing SC, but it does diminish
the risk of misdiagnosing a sarcoma or reactive stroma as SC. The presence of a
sarcomatoid variant of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer points to HPV testing as 
a useful diagnostic tool for atypical spindle cell proliferations of the
oropharynx.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common human cancer
with a frequency increasing worldwide. The risk of developing cSCC has been
strongly associated with chronic sun exposure, especially in light skin people.
The aim of this viewpoint is to discuss the contribution of the tumor suppressor 
p53 and its homologues p63 and p73 in the formation and progression of cSCC.
Mutations in the p53 gene are early and frequent events in skin carcinogenesis
mainly as a consequence of UV light exposure, often followed by loss of function 
of the second allele. Although rarely mutated in cancer, p63 and p73 play key
roles in human cancers, with their truncated isoforms lacking the N-terminal
transactivating domain (<U+2206>N) being often upregulated as compared to normal
tissues. <U+2206>Np63 is abundantly expressed in cSCC, and it is likely to favour tumor 
initiation and progression. The function of p73 in cSCC is more enigmatic and
awaits further studies. Interestingly, an intimate interplay exists between both 
p53 and p63, and the Notch signalling pathway, often inactivated in cSCC. Here,
we summarize our current knowledge about the biological activities of p53 family 
members in cSCC and propose that integration of their signalling with Notch is
key to cSCC formation and progression.

Msx1 and Msx2 were revealed to be candidate genes for some craniofacial
deformities, such as cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) and
craniosynostosis. Many other genes were demonstrated to have a cross-talk with
MSX genes in causing these defects. However, there is no systematic evaluation
for these MSX gene-related factors. In this study, we performed systematic
bioinformatic analysis for MSX genes by combining using GeneDecks, DAVID, and
STRING database, and the results showed that there were numerous genes related to
MSX genes, such as Irf6, TP63, Dlx2, Dlx5, Pax3, Pax9, Bmp4, Tgf-beta2, and
Tgf-beta3 that have been demonstrated to be involved in CL/P, and Fgfr2, Fgfr1,
Fgfr3, and Twist1 that were involved in craniosynostosis. Many of these genes
could be enriched into different gene groups involved in different signaling
ways, different craniofacial deformities, and different biological process. These
findings could make us analyze the function of MSX gens in a gene network. In
addition, our findings showed that Sumo, a novel gene whose polymorphisms were
demonstrated to be associated with nonsyndromic CL/P by genome-wide association
study, has protein-protein interaction with MSX1, which may offer us an
alternative method to perform bioinformatic analysis for genes found by
genome-wide association study and can make us predict the disrupted protein
function due to the mutation in a gene DNA sequence. These findings may guide us 
to perform further functional studies in the future.

Recent studies have demonstrated that deregulated microRNA (miR) expression is
implicated in the development of human cancers. In the aberrant miR expression,
miR-301 is upregulated in cancers, such as pancreatic, colorectal and oral
carcinoma. Based on this evidence, we investigated the contribution of miR-301 to
pancreatic carcinoma and the novel target genes of miR-301 in pancreatic
carcinoma. In this study, we analyzed the effects of enforced and inhibited
expression of miR-301b expression in the Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines. MiR-301b
expression levels were associated with cell invasiveness in both cell lines.
Additional experiments indicated that miR-301b influences invasiveness through
CDH1. Moreover microRNA target search algorithms and experimental strategies
suggested that miR-301b suppressed TP63 expression as a novel target of miR-301b.
Remarkably, miR-301b was also found to be associated with NF-<U+03BA>B activity in both 
cell lines. In summary, overexpressed miR-301b may suppress TP63 expression and
contributes to promote cell invasiveness and to enhance gemcitabine resistance in
pancreatic carcinoma cells. Thus, miR-301b may have potential as a novel
therapeutic target for cancer treatment due to its stimulatory effects on cell
invasiveness.

Non-coding microRNAs are involved in multiple regulatory mechanisms underlying
response of cancer cells to stress leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and
autophagy. Many molecular layers are implicated in such cellular response
including epigenetic regulation of transcription, RNA processing, metabolism,
signaling. The molecular interrelationship between tumor protein (TP)-p53 family 
members and specific microRNAs is a key functional network supporting tumor cell 
response to chemotherapy and potentially playing a decisive role in
chemoresistance of human epithelial cancers. TP63 was shown to modulate the
expression of numerous microRNAs involved in regulation of epithelial cell
proliferation, differentiation, senescence, "stemness" and skin maintenance,
epithelial/ mesenchymal transition, and tumorigenesis in several types of
epithelial cancers (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate
carcinoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, and breast tumors), as well as in
chemoresistance of cancer cells. TP63/microRNA network was shown to be involved
in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, metabolism and epigenetic
transcriptional regulation, thereby providing the groundwork for novel
chemotherapeutic venues.

The tumor protein (TP) p63/microRNAs functional network may play a key role in
supporting the response of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) to chemotherapy. We
show that the cisplatin exposure of SCC-11 cells led to upregulation of miR-297, 
miR-92b-3p, and miR-485-5p through a phosphorylated <U+0394>Np63a-dependent mechanism
that subsequently modulated the expression of the protein targets implicated in
DNA methylation (DNMT3A), histone deacetylation (HDAC9), and demethylation
(KDM4C). Further studies showed that mimics for miR-297, miR-92b-3p, or
miR-485-5p, along with siRNA against and inhibitors of DNMT3A, HDAC9, and KDM4C
modulated the expression of DAPK1, SMARCA2, and MDM2 genes assessed by the
quantitative PCR, promoter luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays. Finally, the above-mentioned treatments affecting epigenetic enzymes also
modulated the response of SCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, rendering the
resistant SCC cells more sensitive to cisplatin exposure, thereby providing the
groundwork for novel chemotherapeutic venues in treating patients with SCC.

BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of TP63 have been suggested to influence
susceptibility to lung adenocarcinoma development in East Asian populations. This
study aimed to investigate the relationship between common polymorphisms in the
TP63 gene and the risk of lung adenocarcinoma, as well as interactions of the
polymorphisms with environmental risk factors in Chinese non-smoking females.
METHODS: A case-control study of 260 cases and 318 controls was conducted. Data
concerning demographic and risk factors were obtained for each subject. The
genetic polymorphisms were determined by Taqman real-time PCR and statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS software.
RESULTS: For 10937405, carriers of the CT genotype or at least one T allele
(CT/TT) had lower risks of lung adenocarcinoma compared with the homozygous wild 
CC genotype in Chinese nonsmoking females (adjusted ORs were 0.68 and 0.69,
95%CIs were 0.48-0.97 and 0.50-0.97, P values were 0.033 and 0.030,
respectively). Allele comparison showed that the T allele of rs10937405 was
associated with a decreased risk of lung adenocarcinoma with an OR of 0.78
(95%CI=0.60-1.01, P=0.059). Our results showed that exposure to cooking oil fumes
was associated with increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese nonsmoking
females (adjusted OR=1.58, 95%CI=1.11-2.25, P=0.011). However, we did not observe
a significant interaction of cooking oil fumes and TP63 polymorphisms.
CONCLUSION: TP63 polymorphism might be a genetic susceptibility factor for lung
adenocarcinoma in Chinese non-smoking females, but no significant interaction was
found with cooking oil fume exposure.

p63, a p53 family member, plays pivotal roles in epidermal development, aging,
and tumorigenesis. Thus, understanding how p63 expression is controlled has
biological and clinical importance. RBM24 is an RNA-binding protein and shares a 
high sequence similarity with RBM38, a critical regulator of p63. In this study, 
we investigated whether RBM24 is capable of regulating p63 expression. Indeed, we
found that ectopic expression of RBM24 decreased, whereas knockdown of RBM24
increased, the levels of p63 transcript and protein. To explore the underlying
mechanism, we found that RBM24 was able to bind to multiple regions in the p63 3'
untranslated region and, subsequently, destabilize p63 transcript. Furthermore,
we showed that the 3' untranslated region in p63 transcript and the RNA-binding
domain in RBM24 were required for RBM24 to bind p63 transcript and consequently, 
inhibit p63 expression. Taken together, our data provide evidence that RBM24 is a
novel regulator of p63 via mRNA stability.IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggests that
p63 is regulated by RBM24 via mRNA stability, which gives an insight into
understanding how posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to p63
expression.

Hospital, Columbus, Ohio 43205.

Under conditions of DNA damage, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) is inhibited, preventing cell cycle progression and conserving cellular 
energy by suppressing translation. We show that suppression of mTORC1 signaling
to 4E-BP1 requires the coordinated activity of two tumor suppressors, p53 and
p63. In contrast, suppression of S6K1 and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation by
DNA damage is Akt-dependent. We find that loss of either p53, required for the
induction of Sestrin 1/2, or p63, required for the induction of REDD1 and
activation of the tuberous sclerosis complex, prevents the DNA damage-induced
suppression of mTORC1 signaling. These data indicate that the negative regulation
of cap-dependent translation by mTORC1 inhibition subsequent to DNA damage is
abrogated in most human cancers.

Carcinomas typically invade as a cohesive multicellular unit, a process termed
collective invasion. It remains unclear how different subpopulations of cancer
cells contribute to this process. We developed three-dimensional (3D) organoid
assays to identify the most invasive cancer cells in primary breast tumors.
Collective invasion was led by specialized cancer cells that were defined by
their expression of basal epithelial genes, such as cytokeratin-14 (K14) and p63.
Furthermore, K14+ cells led collective invasion in the major human breast cancer 
subtypes. Importantly, luminal cancer cells were observed to convert
phenotypically to invasive leaders following induction of basal epithelial genes.
Although only a minority of cells within luminal tumors expressed basal
epithelial genes, knockdown of either K14 or p63 was sufficient to block
collective invasion. Our data reveal that heterotypic interactions between
epithelial subpopulations are critical to collective invasion. We suggest that
targeting the basal invasive program could limit metastatic progression.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between the epithelial expression of
hMLH1, MDM2, and p63 in lower lip carcinogenesis, comparing the immunostaining of
these proteins in cases of actinic cheilitis (AC) and lower lip squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC).
STUDY DESIGN: Forty cases of AC and 40 cases of SCC were studied, both lesions
were of lower lip. Histological sections of 3 µm were submitted to
immunoperoxidase method, and 1000 cells were counted for immunohistochemical
analysis of lesions. The results were analyzed quantitatively, and expression was
compared by the Mann-Whitney, Student t-test, or one-way ANOVA, adopting a level 
of significance of 5%.
RESULTS: A higher percentage of epithelial cells expressing hMLH1 was observed in
cases of AC without dysplasia or mild dysplasia (721.23 ± 88.116), whereas fewer 
positive cells were observed in lower lip SSCs (255.03 ± 199.47) when compared to
the AC group (P < 0.001). Immunoexpression of MDM2 was higher in SCCs of the
lower lip compared with AC (P = 0.019). For p63 protein, the expression was
higher in AC than in SCC (P = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: The present results showed changes in the immunoexpression of hMLH1, 
MDM2, and p63 in epithelial cells from premalignant and malignant lip disease,
supporting the hypothesis that these alterations are related to the process of
lower lip carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: p63, homologous to p53, has been investigated to be involved in
various aspects of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Recently, we have
identified a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17506395 (T>G) in 
p63 which was associated with female reproduction and ovarian cancer development.
The present study aimed to evaluate the association of rs17506395 genotypes with 
breast cancer susceptibility, clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TaqMan assay was used to genotype the rs17506395
polymorphism. The expression of p63 mRNA was determined by quantitative
reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Unconditional logistic regression and
univariate Cox hazard regression analyses were performed to evaluate the
association of rs17506395 with breast cancer susceptibility and prognosis
respectively.
RESULTS: First, we found that breast tumors with TT genotype exhibited higher
level of p63 mRNA compared with other genotypes in breast cancer tissues,
indicating that rs17506395 may be a functional single nucleotide polymorphism in 
breast cancer. Further investigation revealed that the presence of TT genotype
was statistically correlated with increased risk for breast cancer, compared with
genotypes containing the G allele (GG and GT). Moreover, a significant
association between rs17506395 polymorphism and age at diagnosis and status of
hormone receptor was observed. Consistently, prognostic analysis showed that
patients carrying TT genotype represent unfavorable survival, suggesting that TT 
genotype may be a biomarker for poor prognosis in breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rs17506395 polymorphism can function as a risk 
factor and prognostic indicator for breast cancer, whereas precise mechanism
underlying the function of this polymorphism needs further investigation.

No TAP63 promoter mutation is detected in bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex
patients.

Darling T(1), Mahfuz I, White SJ, Cheng W.

Author information:

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC) is thought to
have a genetic component in its pathogenesis. Previously we found that p63(-/-)
mice show increased ventral apoptosis and develop a BEEC phenotype.
Down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic <U+0394>NP63 and an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic
TAP63 isoforms have been demonstrated in BEEC patient bladder tissues. We have
previously shown that insertion/deletion polymorphisms of the <U+0394>Np63 promoter are 
associated with an increased risk of BEEC. In this study, we specifically
examined the TAP63 promoter to see if any sequence changes might lead to
up-regulation of TAP63 and exaggerated apoptosis in BEEC patients.
METHODS: i) Bioinformatic analysis of the TAP63 promoter was performed to
identify putative regulatory regions. ii) High-resolution Melt and Sanger
sequencing was used to screen targeted regions in 112 BEEC patient DNA samples
for potential sequence variants. iii) Sequence variation was analysed for
significance against normal population frequency data.
RESULTS: i) We identified multiple epigenetic markers of transcriptional
regulation within highly conserved areas of the TAP63 promoter sequence. ii) Of
the 112 buccal swab DNA samples, adequate and successful screening ranged between
48 and 67 for each region. iii) No novel sequence variation or mutation was
uncovered. iv) Two known SNPs were identified. However, allele frequency analysis
was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Our data do not associate genetic variation within the TAP63 promoter
region with an increased risk of BEEC. Our data so far suggests that only <U+0394>NP63
promoter aberration is involved in BEEC pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a leading cause of cancer deaths,
represents a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, mostly comprising squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma (AC) and large-cell carcinoma (LCC). The
objectives of this study were to utilize integrated genomic data including
copy-number alteration, mRNA, microRNA expression and candidate-gene full
sequencing data to characterize the molecular distinctions between AC and SCC.
METHODS: Comparative genomic hybridization followed by mutational analysis, gene 
expression and miRNA microarray profiling were performed on 123 paired tumor and 
non-tumor tissue samples from patients with NSCLC.
RESULTS: At DNA, mRNA and miRNA levels we could identify molecular markers that
discriminated significantly between the various histopathological entities of
NSCLC. We identified 34 genomic clusters using aCGH data; several genes exhibited
a different profile of aberrations between AC and SCC, including PIK3CA, SOX2,
THPO, TP63, PDGFB genes. Gene expression profiling analysis identified SPP1,
CTHRC1 and GREM1 as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of the cancer, and
SPINK1 and BMP7 to distinguish between AC and SCC in small biopsies or in blood
samples. Using integrated genomics approach we found in recurrently altered
regions a list of three potential driver genes, MRPS22, NDRG1 and RNF7, which
were consistently over-expressed in amplified regions, had wide-spread
correlation with an average of ~800 genes throughout the genome and highly
associated with histological types. Using a network enrichment analysis, the
targets of these potential drivers were seen to be involved in DNA replication,
cell cycle, mismatch repair, p53 signalling pathway and other lung cancer related
signalling pathways, and many immunological pathways. Furthermore, we also
identified one potential driver miRNA hsa-miR-944.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated molecular characterization of AC and SCC helped identify 
clinically relevant markers and potential drivers, which are recurrent and stable
changes at DNA level that have functional implications at RNA level and have
strong association with histological subtypes.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco and alcohol consumption are risk factors for head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recently, whole-exome sequencing clarified that 
smoking increased TP53 and other mutations in HNSCC; however, the effects of
alcohol consumption on these genetic alterations remain unknown. We explored the 
association between alcohol consumption and somatic copy-number alterations
(SCNAs) across the whole genome in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCCs,
and compared with the effects of smoking on genetic alterations.
METHODS: SCNA and TP53 mutations in tumor samples were examined by
high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization microarray 180K and by direct
sequencing, respectively, and statistically analyzed for associations with
alcohol consumption and smoking during the 20 years preceding diagnosis of HNSCC.
Probes with a corrected p-value (=q-value) less than 0.05 and fold change greater
than 1.2 or less than -1.2 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 248 patients with HNSCC were enrolled. In the HPV-negative
patients (n=221), heavy alcohol consumption was significantly associated with
SCNAs of oncogenes/oncosuppressors that were previously reported to occur
frequently in HNSCCs: CDKN2A (q=0.005), FHIT (q=0.005), 11q13 region including
CCND1, FADD and CTTN (q=0.005), ERBB2 (HER2) (q=0.009), 3q25-qter including
CCNL1, TP63, DCUN1D1 and PIK3CA (q=0.014), and CSMD1 (q=0.019). But, TP53
mutations were not affected. In contrast, smoking was associated with increased
risk of TP53 mutations, but did not induce any significant SCNAs of
oncogenes/oncosuppressors.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both alcohol consumption and smoking had
distinct effects on genetic alterations in HNSCCs. Heavy alcohol consumption may 
trigger previously known and unknown SCNAs, but may not induce TP53 mutation. In 
contrast, smoking may induce TP53 mutation, but may not trigger any SCNAs.

<U+0394>Np63 is known to be critical in skin development and cancer; however, how it
triggers proliferation and inflammation in vivo remains to be elucidated. Here,
we find that induced <U+0394>Np63 expression in skin of transgenic mice (TG) results in 
a hyperproliferative epidermis coupled with inflammatory infiltrates. In situ,
infiltrating cells include CD45(+) leukocytes, CD19(+) B lymphocytes, CD3(+) T
lymphocytes, CD4(+) T helper, CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) Treg, Ly6B(+) neutrophils,
S-100(+) dendritic cells, and macrophages bearing CD11b(+), F4/80(+), CD68(+),
and CD206(+) M2 type markers. Transcriptional profiling of TG skin revealed
increased gene expression involved in inflammation and immune responses,
including Th2/M2 cytokines and chemokines. These genes were co-regulated by <U+0394>Np63
and NF-<U+03BA>B RelA or cRel, and enhanced by TNF-a. Elevated cRel, RelA, and IKKs were
observed in TG mouse skin and human squamous carcinomas with <U+0394>Np63
overexpression. Thus, our findings unveil a missing link connecting overexpressed
<U+0394>Np63 with aberrant NF-<U+03BA>B activation, pro-inflammatory and type 2 cytokines and
chemokines, and host infiltrates during skin inflammation and hyperplasia. Our
findings provide a missing link between <U+0394>Np63 overexpression and NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated
inflammation, of potential relevance to the pathogenesis of squamous carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: The tumor suppressor p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor 
that regulates an extensive network of coding genes, long non-coding RNAs and
microRNAs, that establish intricate gene regulatory circuits influencing many
cellular responses beyond the prototypical control of cell cycle, apoptosis and
DNA repair.
METHODS: Using bioinformatic approaches, we identified an additional group of
candidate microRNAs (miRs) under direct p53 transcriptional control. To validate 
p53 family-mediated responsiveness of the newly predicted target miRs we first
evaluated the potential for wild type p53, p63ß and p73ß to transactivate from
p53 response elements (REs) mapped in the miR promoters, using an established
yeast-based assay.
RESULTS: The REs found in miR-10b, -23b, -106a, -151a, -191, -198, -202, -221,
-320, -1204, -1206 promoters were responsive to p53 and 8 of them were also
responsive to p63ß or p73ß. The potential for germline p53 mutations to drive
transactivation at selected miR-associated REs was also examined. Chromatin
Immuno-Precipitation (ChIP) assays conducted in doxorubicin-treated MCF7 cells
and HCT116 p53+/+ revealed moderate induction of p53 occupancy at the miR-202,
-1204, -1206, -10b RE-containing sites, while weak occupancy was observed for the
miR-23b-associated RE only in MCF7 cells. RT-qPCR analyses cells showed modest
doxorubicin- and/or Nutlin-dependent induction of the levels of mature miR-10b,
-23b, -151a in HCT116 p53+/+ and MCF7 cells. The long noncoding RNA PVT1
comprising miR-1204 and -1206 was weakly induced only in HCT116 p53+/+ cells, but
the mature miRs were not detected. miR-202 expression was not influenced by
p53-activating stimuli in our cell systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals additional miRs, particularly miR-10b and
miR-151a, that could be directly regulated by the p53-family of transcription
factors and contribute to the tuning of p53-induced responses.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma found in children
and young adults. It is characterized by the expression of a number of skeletal
muscle-specific proteins, including MyoD and muscle a-actin. However, unlike
normal myoblasts, RMS cells differentiate poorly both in vivo and in culture. As 
microRNAs are known to regulate tumorigenesis, intensive efforts have been made
to identify microRNAs that are involved in RMS development. In this work, we
found that miR-203 was frequently down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation in 
both RMS cell lines and RMS biopsies and could be reactivated by
DNA-demethylating agents. Re-expression of miR-203 in RMS cells inhibited their
migration and proliferation and promoted terminal myogenic differentiation.
Mechanistically, miR-203 exerts its tumor-suppressive effect by directly
targeting p63 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor in RMS cells, which
promotes myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the Notch and the
JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathways, respectively. Our work reveals that miR-203 functions 
as a tumor suppressor in RMS development.

Tumor markers Ki67, TP53, and TP63 are common labels in the diagnosis of bladder 
cancer (BCa) around the world. The combination of those biomarkers may have
advantages in predicting BCa prognosis and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC) postoperative recurrence. We investigated the immunohistochemical
profiles of 313 bladder cancer samples classified under the WHO/ISUP (2004)
grading scale and the UICC-TNM (2002) classification. Then we investigated their 
predictive value in the tumor recurrence of 270 NMIBC patients after TURBT.
Expression of Ki67 correlates with grade, stage, tumor size, and tumor numbers.
Semiquantitative evaluation of TP53 correlates with grade and invasive
conditions. The positive expression rate of TP63 correlated with tumor grade and 
stage. The combined effect of TP53 and Ki67 revealed a predictive value in NMIBC 
recurrence. However, the positive TP63 expression did not show any protective
effect in NMIBC recurrence. The expression of TP53 and Ki67 could be used to
predict the risk of NMIBC recurrence postoperatively.

Maspin, a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors, has been shown to
inhibit tumor growth and suppress metastasis in several malignancies, including
lung cancer. Previous studies have reported that p63 and p53 control maspin
expression by transactivating the promoter. The present study analyzed
immunohistochemical studies to determine the expression and coexpression patterns
of maspin, p63 and p53 in non-small cell lung carcinoma, specifically squamous
cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The results showed that 83/86 cases (96.5%) of
squamous cell carcinoma and 82/161 cases (50.9%) of adenocarcinoma included in
this study were positive for maspin. There were 79/86 cases (91.9%) of squamous
cell carcinoma and 16/161 cases (9.9%) of adenocarcinoma with positive expression
for p63. In addition, 77/86 cases (89.5%) of squamous cell carcinoma and 99/161
cases (61.5%) of adenocarcinoma were positive for p53. Maspin, p63 and p53
expression were each significantly higher in squamous cell carcinoma than
adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas more highly coexpress maspin and p63, as
well as maspin and p53, when compared with adenocarcinomas. The high frequency of
coexpression of maspin and p63, as well as maspin and p53, in squamous cell
carcinoma, suggests that p63 and p53 may be involved in the pathway to control
maspin expression. Therapeutic targeting on maspin, p63 and p53 molecules might
be beneficial in the management of patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the 
lung in the future.

The control and processing of microRNAs (miRs) is critical in the regulation of
all cellular responses. Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in the
expression of certain miRs, or an overall decrease in miR processing through the 
partial depletion of Dicer, can promote enhanced metastatic potential. We show
here that Dicer depletion can promote the invasive behavior of cells that is
reflected in enhanced recycling and activation of the growth factor receptors Met
and EGF receptor. These responses are also seen in response to the expression of 
tumor-derived mutant p53s, and we show that mutant p53 can down-regulate Dicer
expression through both direct inhibition of the TAp63-mediated transcriptional
activation of Dicer and a TAp63-independent control of Dicer protein expression. 
Our results delineate a clear relationship between mutant p53, TAp63, and Dicer
that might contribute to the metastatic function of mutant p53 but,
interestingly, also reveal TAp63-independent functions of mutant p53 in
controlling Dicer activity.

Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), representing variable degree of median
clefts of hands and feet, is a genetically heterogeneous group of limb
malformations with seven loci mapped on different human chromosomes. However,
only 3 genes (TP63, WNT10B, DLX5) for the seven loci have been identified. The
study, presented here, described three consanguineous Pakistani families
segregating SHFM in autosomal recessive manner. Linkage in the families was
searched by genotyping microsatellite markers and mutation screening of candidate
gene was performed by Sanger DNA sequencing. Clinical features of affected
members of these families exhibited SHFM phenotype with involvement of hands and 
feet. Genotyping using microsatellite markers mapped the families to WNT10B gene 
at SHFM6 on chromosome 12q13.11-q13. Subsequently, sequence analysis of WNT10B
gene revealed a novel 4-bp deletion mutation (c.1165_1168delAAGT) in one family
and 7-bp duplication (c.300_306dupAGGGCGG) in two other families. Structure-based
analysis showed a significant conformational shift in the active binding site of 
mutated WNT10B (p.Lys388Glufs*36), influencing binding with Fzd8. The mutations
identified in the WNT10B gene extend the body of evidence implicating it in the
pathogenesis of SHFM.

PURPOSE: Evaluation of the value of thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1) and P63 
in subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer in cytologic material.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study including 40 cases of primary
lung lesions who underwent image guided FNAC from pulmonary nodules. The final
histopathologic diagnosis was the gold standard. Cell blocks were stained with
anti-TTF-1, and P63. Nuclear immunoreactivity for both markers was considered
specific. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, of
the cytologic diagnosis and of the two markers, as well as the accuracy of the
combined markers were calculated.
RESULTS: Cytomorphology achieved a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 91%, PPV 
of 91%, and NPV of 83.3%, for the diagnosis of AC, and 91% sensitivity, 83.3%
specificity, 83.3% PPV, and 91% NPV, for the diagnosis of SCC. The concordance
between cytologic and histopathologic diagnoses of AC and SCC was 87%. TTF-1
achieved 87.5% sensitivity, 94.7% specificity, 95.5% PPV, and 85.7% NPV for AC,
while P63 achieved 94.7% sensitivity, 95.8% specificity, 94.7% PPV, and 95.8% NPV
for SCC. TTF-1 enhanced the sensitivity of cytomorphology for AC from 83.3% to
87.5%, and specificity from 91% to 94.7%. Similarly P63 enhanced the sensitivity 
for SCC from 91% to 94.7%, and specificity from 83.3% to 95.8%.
CONCLUSION: TTF-1 achieved moderate sensitivity, and high specificity in the
diagnosis of AC, while P63 was highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of
SCC. Immunocytochemistry raised the sensitivity and specificity of FNAC in
diagnosing AC and SCC using TTF-1 and P63, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown
therapeutic potential in acute lung injury. Recently, placenta-derived human
mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) have shown similarities with bone marrow-derived
MSCs in terms of regenerative capabilities and immunogenicity. This study
investigates the hypothesis that treatment with PMSCs reduces the development of 
bronchiolitis obliterans in a murine heterotopic tracheal transplant model.
METHODS: A murine heterotopic tracheal transplant model was used to study the
continuum from acute to chronic rejection. In the treatment groups, PMSCs or
PMSC-conditioned medium (PMSCCM) were injected either locally or intratracheally 
into the allograft. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or blank medium was injected 
in the control groups. Tracheal luminal obliteration was assessed on sections
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Infiltration of inflammatory and immune cells
and epithelial progenitor cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry and
densitometric analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with injection of PBS, local injection of PMSCs significantly
reduced luminal obliteration at 28 days after transplantation (P = .015).
Intratracheal injection of PMSCs showed similar results to local injection of
PMSCs compared with injection of PBS and blank medium (P = .022). Tracheas
treated with PMSC/PMSCCM showed protection against the loss of epithelium on day 
14, with an increase in P63+CK14+ epithelial progenitor cells and Foxp3+
regulatory T cells. In addition, injection of PMSCs and PMSCCM significantly
reduced the number of neutrophils and CD3+ T cells on day 14.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that treatment with PMSCs is protective
against the development of bronchiolitis obliterans in an heterotopic tracheal
transplant model. These results indicate that PMSCs could provide a novel
therapeutic option to reduce chronic rejection after lung transplant.

miR-155 is an oncogenic microRNA which is upregulated in many solid cancers. The 
targets of miR-155 are well established , with over 100 confirmed mRNA targets.
However, the regulation of miR-155 and the basis of its upregulation in cancer is
not well understood. We have previously shown that miR-155 is regulated by p63,
and here we investigate the role of the major p63 isoforms TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 in
this regulation. When the TAp63 isoform was knocked down, or exogenously
overexpressed, miR-155 levels were elevated in response to TAp63 knockdown or
reduced in response to TAp63 overexpression. The <U+0394>Np63 isoform is shown to
directly bind to the p63 response element on the miR-155 host gene, and this
binding is enriched when TAp63 is knocked down. This could indicate that TAp63
prevents <U+0394>Np63 from binding to the miR-155 host gene. The knockdown of TAp63, and
the subsequent elevation of miR-155, enhances migration and tumour growth similar
to that seen when directly overexpressing miR-155. The migratory phenotype is
abrogated when miR-155 is inhibited, indicating that miR-155 is responsible for
the phenotypic effect of TAp63 knockdown.

Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of human limbal
stem/progenitor cells (LSCs). To examine the possible function of Frizzled (Fz)
receptors in LSCs, the expression of 10 Fz receptors was profiled in the limbus
and cornea. Only Fz7 had preferential expression in the basal limbal epithelium
which contains the LSCs. The expression of Fz7 was colocalized with the putative 
LSC markers including p63a, N-cadherin and keratin (K) 14, and was minimum in
cells expressing the corneal maturation marker K12. The expression of Fz7 was
higher in the enriched LSCs population and decreased in cultured LSCs when there 
was a loss of progenitor phenotype. When the Fz7 was knocked down (Fz(KD)) using 
shRNA in primary LSCs, the expression of putative LSC markers ABCG2, <U+0394>Np63a, and 
K14 was decreased significantly. The colony forming efficiency of the Fz7(KD)
LSCs was significantly decreased in the subsequent passage 1 and 2 compared to
the control. Our finding suggests that Wnt signaling is one of the factors of LSC
niche, and Fz7 helps to maintain the undifferentiated state of LSCs.

The therapeutic options now available for pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma
(SQCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) are very different. The increasing demand to make
a diagnosis on minimal tissue, ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) are need to be highly sensitive and specific. The IHC marker p40 (<U+0394>Np63) is
a truncated isoform of p63 that is a promising IHC marker for SQCC. In this
study, we have compared the specificity of p40(<U+0394>Np63) IHC with p63 and
cytokeratin 5 (CK5) on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cell blocks (CB). Thirty
cases of pulmonary SQCC and 30 cases of pulmonary ADC with CB were selected. IHC 
for p40(<U+0394>Np63), p63, and CK5 were performed on all paraffin-embedded CB serial
sections. All cases (n = 30) of SQCC stained positive for p40(<U+0394>Np63). All cases
of bronchopulmonary ADC were negative for both p40(<U+0394>Np63) and CK5. Six cases
(20%) of bronchopulmonary ADC demonstrated nuclear staining for p63 in at least
10% of malignant cells. Our data support p40(<U+0394>Np63) to be more sensitive and
specific and possess a greater positive and negative predictive value for SQCC in
comparison to p63. This study also documents that p40(<U+0394>Np63) does not stain ADC, 
which p63 does in 20% of the cases. We also found that p40(<U+0394>Np63) shows a greater
sensitivity and negative predictive value when compared to CK5. In paucicellular 
CB the increased indices p40(<U+0394>Np63) provides may be extremely helpful in

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death and disease burden in many
countries. Understanding of the biological pathways involved in lung cancer
aetiology is required to identify key biomolecules that could be of significant
clinical value, either as predictive, prognostic or diagnostic markers, or as
targets for the development of novel therapies to treat this disease, in addition
to smoking avoidance strategies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
enabled significant progress in the past 5 years in investigating genetic
susceptibility to lung cancer. Large scale, multi-cohort GWAS of mainly
Caucasian, smoking, populations have identified strong associations for lung
cancer mapped to chromosomal regions 15q [nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR) subunits: CHRNA3, CHRNA5], 5p (TERT-CLPTM1L locus) and 6p (BAT3-MSH5).
Some studies in Asian populations of smokers have found similar risk loci,
whereas GWAS in never smoking Asian females have identified associations in other
chromosomal regions, e.g., 3q (TP63), that are distinct from smoking-related lung
cancer risk loci. GWAS of smoking behaviour have identified risk loci for smoking
quantity at 15q (similar genes to lung cancer susceptibility: CHRNA3, CHRNA5) and
19q (CYP2A6). Other genes have been mapped for smoking initiation and smoking
cessation. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a known risk
factor for lung cancer, GWAS in large cohorts have also found CHRNA3 and CHRNA5
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping at 15q as risk loci, as well as
other regions at 4q31 (HHIP), 4q24 (FAM13A) and 5q (HTR4). The overlap in risk
loci between lung cancer, smoking behaviour and COPD may be due to the effects of
nicotine addiction; however, more work needs to be undertaken to explore the
potential direct effects of nicotine and its metabolites in gene-environment
interaction in these phenotypes. Goals of future genetic susceptibility studies
of lung cancer should focus on refining the strongest risk loci in a wide range
of populations with lung cancer, and integrating other clinical and biomarker
information, in order to achieve the aim of personalised therapy for lung cancer.

Split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a congenital limb defect affecting
predominantly the central rays of the autopod and occurs either as an isolated
trait or part of a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. SHFM is usually
sporadic, familial forms are uncommon. The condition is clinically and
genetically heterogeneous and shows mostly autosomal dominant inheritance with
variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. To date, seven chromosomal loci
associated with isolated SHFM have been described, i.e., SHFM1 to 6 and
SHFM/SHFLD. The autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is typical for SHFM1,
SHFM3, SHFM4, SHFM5. Autosomal recessive and X-linked inheritance is very
uncommon and have been noted only in a few families. Most of the known SHFM loci 
are associated with chromosomal rearrangements that involve small deletions or
duplications of the human genome. In addition, three genes, i.e., TP63, WNT10B,
and DLX5 are known to carry point mutations in patients affected by SHFM. In this
review, we focus on the known molecular basis of isolated SHFM. We provide
clinical and molecular information about each type of abnormality as well as
discuss the underlying pathways and mechanism that contribute to their
development. Recent progress in the understanding of SHFM pathogenesis currently 
allows for the identification of causative genetic changes in about 50 % of the
patients affected by this condition. Therefore, we propose a diagnostic
flow-chart helpful in the planning of molecular genetic tests aimed at
identifying disease causing mutation. Finally, we address the issue of genetic
counseling, which can be extremely difficult and challenging especially in
sporadic SHFM cases.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is an accumulative disorder marked by
deficient apoptosis. The TP53 homolog TAp63 promotes apoptosis and
chemosensitivity in solid tumours and its deregulation may contribute to CLL cell
survival. We found that TAp63a was the most prevalent TP63 isoform in CLL.
Compared to healthy B cells, TAp63 mRNA was repressed in 55·7% of CLL samples.
TP63 promoter methylation was high in CLL and inversely correlated with TP63
protein expression in B-cell lymphoma cell lines. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
TP63 resulted in partial protection from spontaneous apoptosis accompanied by
reductions in PMAIP1 (NOXA), BBC3 (PUMA), and BAX mRNA in CLL cells and increased
proliferation of Raji lymphoma cells. TAp63 mRNA levels were higher in CLL with
unmutated IGHV. B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement led to repression of TP63 mRNA
expression in malignant B cells, while pharmacological inhibition of BCR
signalling prevented TP63 downregulation. MIR21, known to target TAp63,
correlated inversely with TAp63 expression in CLL, and BCR-mediated
downregulation of TP63 was accompanied by MIR21 upregulation in most CLL samples.
Our data illustrate the pro-apoptotic function of TP63, provide insights into the
mechanisms of BCR-targeting agents, and establish a rationale for designing novel
approaches to induce TP63 in CLL and B-cell lymphoma.

OBJECTIVE: Specific subclassification of pulmonary non-small cell carcinoma
(NSCCA) is clinically necessary, and the aim of this study is to examine the
utilization of p40 (<U+0394>Np63) in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for lung NSCCA.
STUDY DESIGN: Database files of the Washington University Medical Center were
searched. Patients who underwent endobronchial ultrasound and CT FNA of a primary
lung neoplasia were selected and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. A
panel of markers was utilized, including p40, p63, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, thyroid 
transcription factor, and napsin.
RESULTS: One hundred patients were identified and comprised 38 squamous cell
carcinomas (SCCA), 46 adenocarcinomas (AdCA), and 16 NSCCA. For SCCA, p40 was
positive in 34/38 cases (89%) and negative in 4/38 cases (11%); p63 was positive 
in 33/38 cases (87%) and negative in 5/38 cases (13%); CK5/6 was positive in
38/38 cases. For AdCA cases, p40 was negative, p63 was positive in 2 cases (5%)
and CK5/6 was negative in 43/46 cases (92%).
CONCLUSION: For NSCCA, p40 had 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to
p63 with 86% sensitivity and 96% specificity and CK5/6 with 100% sensitivity and 
96% specificity. In the evaluation of FNA biopsy for pulmonary NSCCA, p40 is a
useful IHC marker for neoplastic subclassification, with better specificity in
comparison to p63.

Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors that seriously threaten
human health. Current evidence suggests that heredity contributes to the
progression of lung cancer. To investigate and validate potential genetic
associations with the risk of lung cancer, we conducted a case-control study
including 309 cases and 310 controls from Xi'an City, which is located in
northwest China, and genotyped six SNPs in five genes, which are related to
metabolic process. Overall, our results show that the SNP rs10937405 was
associated with a decreased occurrence of lung cancer (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.72; 95%
CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.56-0.92; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009). In the genetic models analysis, we found that
genotype "CT" of rs10937405 in TP63 was associated with a decreased lung cancer
risk (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.99; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.031); the genotype "TT" of rs10937405
showed a decreased lung cancer risk in the co-dominant model (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.53; 95% CI, 
0.30-0.95; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.031). The genotype "CT-TT" of rs10937405 also showed a decreased
lung cancer risk in the dominant model (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.92; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.014) 
and the log-additive model (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.92; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0085). The
genotype "CC-CT" of rs10937405 confers a higher risk of lung cancer for males
than females. Our results, combined with those from previous studies, suggest
that genetic variation in TP63 may influence lung cancer susceptibility in the
Han population.

Differential diagnosis of collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) from invasive upper
tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) can be challenging. PAX8 and p63 are 2 markers 
often used in this setting. GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) is a marker of
urothelial differentiation. We investigated GATA3 expression in CDC and UTUC and 
its use in this differential. Eighteen CDC and 25 UTUC cases were used to build 2
tissue microarrays. GATA3, p63, and PAX8 nuclear expression was evaluated using
standard immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity and percentage of positive
cells were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive values of the markers and their combination were also evaluated. We
found GATA3 positivity in 22 (88%) of 25 UTUCs and 1 (6%) of 18 CDCs. The median 
GATA3 extent of expression was higher in UTUC than in CDC (74% versus 0%, P =
.00). We found p63 positivity in 23 (92%) of 25 UTUCs and 2 (11%) of 18 CDCs.
PAX8 was positive in 3 (12%) of 25 UTUCs and all (100%) CDCs. GATA3 sensitivity
and specificity for UTUC were 88% and 94%, respectively. p63 sensitivity and
specificity for UTUC were 92% and 89%, respectively. The p63+/PAX8- profile
showed higher sensitivity for UTUC than did the GATA3+/PAX8- profile (80% versus 
76%). Both showed a specificity of 100% for UTUC. GATA3+ or p63+/PAX8-
sensitivity and specificity for UTUC were 84% and 100%, respectively.
Immunohistochemical expression of GATA3 was higher in UTUC, suggesting a
potential role for distinguishing UTUC from CDC. Adding this marker to the
combination panel of p63 and PAX8 might improve its performance in the diagnosis 
of epithelial neoplasms involving the renal sinus.

Cisplatin-induced and ATM-phosphorylated (p)-<U+0394>Np63a regulates the expression of
epidermal differentiation and skin barrier regulators (AQP3, CASP14, ALOX12B, and
CLDN1) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells by dual transcriptional and
post-transcriptional mechanisms. We found that p-<U+0394>Np63a bound to target gene
promoters, and regulated the activity of the tested promoters in vitro. P-<U+0394>Np63a 
was shown to upregulate miR-185-5p and downregulate let7-5p, which subsequently
modulated AQP3, CASP14, ALOX12B and CLDN1 through their respective
3'-untranslated regions. The introduction of miR-185-5p into resistant SCC-11M
cells, which are unable to phosphorylate <U+0394>Np63a, render these cells more
sensitive to cisplatin treatment. Further studies of the AQP3, CASP14, ALOX12B,
and CLDN1 contributions to chemoresistance may assist in developing novel
microRNA-based therapies for human SCC.

The current standard method to culture human limbal stem/progenitor cells (LSCs) 
in vitro is to culture limbal epithelial cells directly on a layer of murine 3T3 
feeder cells (standard method). The direct contact between human cells and murine
feeder cells poses the potential risk of incomplete removal of feeder cells after
culture and cross-contamination in clinical applications. We present here a novel
three-dimensional (3D) sandwich method in which LSCs and feeder cells were
separately cultured on opposite sides of a porous membrane. Limbal epithelial
cells in the form of single-cell suspensions, cell clusters, and tissue explants 
were subjected to standard culture or to a 3D sandwich culture method. The 3D
sandwich method consistently yielded LSCs derived from cell clusters and tissue
explants. The expanded LSCs exhibited a small, compact, cuboidal stem-cell
morphology and stem cell phenotypes comparable to those of LSCs derived from the 
standard culture method. Limbal epithelial cell clusters cultured with the
sandwich method had a significantly higher proliferation rate than did those
cultured with the standard method. The 3D sandwich method did not favor the
propagation of single LSCs. In summary, the 3D sandwich method permits complete
separation between cultured cells and feeder cells, while providing an even and
maximal proximity between them. This alternative method permits culturing of LSCs
without the risk of feeder cell contamination.

A compromised Fanconi Anemia (FA) signaling pathway, often resulting from an
inactivated FANCD2, was recently recognized to contribute to the development of
non-FA human tumors. However, it is largely unknown as to how an impaired FA
pathway or an inactivated FANCD2 promotes tumorigenesis. Here we unexpectedly
found that <U+0394>Np63 mRNA was expressed at high levels in human cancer cells carrying
an impaired FA pathway compared to the corresponding control cells carrying an
intact FA pathway. This observation was recapitulated upon conditionally managing
the status of FANCD2 monoubiquitination /activation in 293T cells. Importantly,
<U+0394>Np63 elevation upon FANCD2 inactivation was confirmed in human fibroblasts
derived from FA patients. Moreover, we have identified a 189 bp DNA fragment
downstream of the <U+0394>Np63 promoter (P2) that can mediate the upregulation of <U+0394>Np63 
by an inactivated FANCD2, and determined that elevated <U+0394>Np63 is high enough to
promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. In vivo, the elevation of FAVL,
a tumor promotion factor that inhibits FANCD2 activation, was found to be
positively associated with <U+0394>Np63 expression in human cancer tissues.
Collectively, these results document a novel role of an inactivated FANCD2 in
upregulating <U+0394>Np63, advancing our understanding of how an impaired FA pathway
contributes to the pathogenesis of human cancer.

California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.

p63, a transcription factor and p53 family protein, plays a crucial role in tumor
suppression and development of various epithelial tissues. While p63 expression
is controlled mostly by post-translational modifications, recent studies indicate
that transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations are essential for proper
p63 expression. Here, we investigated the regulation of p63 expression by poly
(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1, also known as hnRNP-E1 and aCP1). We found that
knockdown of PCBP1 decreases the level of p63 transcript and protein. We also
found that PCBP1 regulates the stability of p63 mRNA via binding to p63 3'UTR.
Additionally, we found that a CU-rich element (CUE) in p63 3'UTR is bound by and 
responsive to PCBP1. Together, we conclude that PCBP1 regulates p63 expression
via mRNA stability.

The development of the mature epidermis requires a coordinated sequence of
signaling events and transcriptional changes to specify surface ectodermal
progenitor cells to the keratinocyte lineage. The initial events that specify
epidermal keratinocytes from ectodermal progenitor cells are not well understood.
Here, we use both developing mouse embryos and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
to explore the mechanisms that direct keratinocyte fate from ectodermal
progenitor cells. We show that both hESCs and murine embryos express p63 before
keratin 14. Furthermore, we find that Notch signaling is activated before p63
expression in ectodermal progenitor cells. Inhibition of Notch signaling
pharmacologically or genetically reveals a negative regulatory role for Notch
signaling in p63 expression during ectodermal specification in hESCs or mouse
embryos, respectively. Taken together, these data reveal a role for Notch
signaling in the molecular control of ectodermal progenitor cell specification to
the epidermal keratinocyte lineage.

Cutaneous meningioma: a potential diagnostic pitfall in p63 positive cutaneous
neoplasms.

Cutaneous meningiomas are divided into three groups. Type I lesions present at
birth and are derived from ectopic arachnoid cells. Type II lesions usually
present in adults and are derived from arachnoid cells surrounding nerve bundles.
Type III lesions are due to direct extension or metastasis from dural-based
neoplasms. Dural-based meningiomas are known to express p63. The aim of our study
is to examine the expression of p63 in type II and type III meningioma. Two cases
of cutaneous meningioma (type II and type III) were evaluated for the expression 
of p63, EMA, CK 5/6, S100 and CD31. The cells of interest were spindled to
epithelioid and arranged in a whorling pattern. Immunohistochemical staining
showed expression of EMA and p63 in both cases, while stains for CK 5/6, S100 and
CD31 were negative. Among cutaneous tumors, p63 is considered a marker of
epithelial derivation, as it is positive in epidermal and adnexal neoplasms. It
is important to be aware of p63 expression in the context of cutaneous meningioma
to avoid misinterpretation as an epithelial tumor. On the basis of our small
study, it is unlikely that p63 expression would be helpful in distinguishing
between type II and type III meningioma, as both may be p63-positive.

TP73 is a member of the TP53 family, whose deregulated expression has been
reported in a wide variety of cancers and linked to patients' outcome. The fact
that TP73 encodes a complex number of isoforms (TAp73 and <U+0394>TAp73) with opposing
functions and the cross-talk with other members of the family (TP53 and TP63)
make it difficult to determine its clinical relevance. Here, we review the
molecular mechanisms driving TAp73 and <U+0394>TAp73 expression and how these variants
inhibit or promote carcinogenesis. We also highlight the intricate interplay
between TP53 family members. In addition, we comment on current pharmacological
approaches targeting the TP73 pathway and those affecting the TAp73/<U+0394>TAp73 ratio.
Finally, we discuss the current data available in the literature that provide
evidence on the role of TP73 variants in predicting prognosis. To date, most of
the studies that evaluate the status levels of TP73 isoforms have been based on
limited-size series. Despite this limitation, these publications highlight the
correlation between high levels of the oncogenic forms and failure to respond to 
chemotherapy and/or shorter survival. Finally, we emphasize the need for studies 
to evaluate the significance of combining the deregulation of various members of 
the TP53 family in order to define patient outcome or their responsiveness to
specific therapies.

BACKGROUND: New epithelial cells are generated through the proliferation and
differentiation of resident progenitor cells in the nasal cavity. In several
upper airway diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis,
self-renewing progenitor cells may be functionally defective, or compromised in
their ability, to regenerate cells that maintain normal mucociliary clearance.
Herein, we describe our early work to define and characterize a rare population
of human nasal epithelial putative progenitors.
METHODS: Single-cell suspensions of human ethmoid sinus tissues were prepared
following endoscopic sinus surgery. Cell surface antibodies were analyzed as
candidate markers for detecting progenitor cells. A panel of antibodies,
including epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, epithelial cells), CD45
(hematopoietic cells), nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR/CD271), intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1/CD54), and integrin-a6 (ITGA6/CD49f) were used to
resolve epithelial progenitor candidates by high-dimensional flow cytometry and
the gating technique of fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls.
RESULTS: A rare population of approximately 0.06% of total ethmoid cells was
discriminated as EpCAM(-) CD45(-) NGFR(+) ICAM1(+) by surface markers. Use of
ITGA6 was excluded based on FMO control analysis. This lineage-negative
population was purified to 99% homogeneity by cell sorting and analyzed by
immunofluorescence microscopy. Sorted cells were subsequently confirmed to
uniformly express the transcription factor p63. Upon in vitro culture,
lineage-negative clonal cells were confirmed to spontaneously differentiate into 
epithelial lineage-positive cells.
CONCLUSION: Using the NGFR and ICAM1 cellular coordinates, we have identified a
promising population of native human nasal epithelial progenitor cells that
require more formal investigation for their role in upper airway regeneration.

The TP63 gene gives rise to protein isoforms with different properties and
functions due to the presence (TAp63) or absence (<U+0394>Np63) of an N-terminal
p53-like transactivation domain. Immunohistochemistry for p63 has clinical value 
for certain tumour types, but investigations have been hampered by a lack of well
characterized antibodies and the inability to discriminate between these
N-terminal isoforms with opposite functional properties. We have extensively
characterized a series of monoclonal antibodies to recombinant human TAp63 and
two commercial p63 monoclonals by Western blot, immunostaining and phage display 
epitope mapping. Twenty-eight of 29 (96.6 %) novel monoclonals that recognized
all p63 isoforms showed substantial cross-reactivity with p73, as did the
commercial antibody, 4A4. One novel clone, PANp63-6.1, showed slight
cross-reaction with p73 by Western blotting but not immunohistochemistry and the 
SFI-6 monoclonal did not cross-react with p73 or p53. Phage display revealed that
the PANp63-6.1 epitope has one amino acid difference between p63 and p73, the 4A4
epitope is identical in both, whereas the SFI-6 epitope is unique to p63,
accounting for these findings. We also produced and characterized a
TAp63-specific clone that does not recognize p53 or p73, and we prepared
polyclonal sera specific for <U+0394>Np63 isoforms. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated
that TAp63 is expressed in a variety of epithelial and other cell types during
development, often in a converse pattern to <U+0394>Np63, but has a very limited
expression in normal adult tissues and is independent of <U+0394>Np63. TAp63 was
expressed in 17.6 % of squamous cancers of cervix that expressed p63, unlike
normal cervix where TAp63 was not expressed. TAp63 did not associate with
proliferative index, but cervical carcinomas with TAp63 expression showed
improved survival. These data highlight the need for rigorous antibody
characterization and indicate that p63-isoform identification may improve the
clinical value of p63 expression analyses.

Many tumours harbour mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene that result in
the expression of a mutant p53 protein. This mutant p53 protein has, in most
cases, lost wild-type transcriptional activity and can also acquire novel
functions in promoting invasion and metastasis. One of the mechanisms underlying 
these novel functions involves the ability of the mutant p53 to interfere with
other transcription factors, including the p53 family protein TAp63. To
investigate whether simultaneous depletion of both p53 and TAp63 can recapitulate
the effect of mutant p53 expression in vivo, we used a mouse model of pancreatic 
cancer in which the expression of mutant p53 resulted in the rapid appearance of 
primary tumours and metastases. As shown previously, loss of one allele of
wild-type (WT) p53 accelerated tumour development. A change of one WT p53 allele 
into mutant p53 did not further accelerate tumour development, but did promote
the formation of metastasis. By contrast, loss of TAp63 did not significantly
accelerate tumour development or metastasis. However, simultaneous depletion of
p53 and TAp63 led to both rapid tumour development and metastatic potential,
although the incidence of metastases remained lower than that seen in mutant
p53-expressing tumours. TAp63/p53-null cells derived from these mice also showed 
an enhanced ability to scatter and invade in tissue culture as was observed in
mutant p53 cells. These data suggest that depletion of TAp63 in a p53-null tumour
can promote metastasis and recapitulate-to some extent-the consequences of mutant
p53 expression.

Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition in the esophagus, with a
rising incidence rate among Caucasians, and an established risk factor for the
subsequent progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In contrast to the
stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus, BE is
characterized by columnar epithelium that to some extent resembles the mucosa of 
the lower intestinal tract. The mechanism of intestinalization of the esophagus
is still uncertain. For many years, it was postulated that either abnormal
differentiation of resident progenitor cells in the esophagus, or
transdifferentiation of mature esophageal keratinocytes provoked by
reflux-induced genetic alterations, resulted in the BE phenotype. However, more
recent studies suggest that indigenous progenitor cells at the gastro-esophageal 
junction might, under unfavorable conditions such as TP63 loss or an activated
inflammatory response, migrate to the esophagus and initiate columnar cell
differentiation. In this review, we discuss the competing theories of the origins
of BE, as well as the role of developmental signaling pathways such as Notch,
Hedgehog, and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling that have been implicated in the molecular 
pathogenesis of BE and EAC. Additionally, we provide an overview of the
mutational landscapes of BE and EAC, derived from the results of recently
published next generation sequencing (NGS) studies. Future research should
elucidate whether NGS on endoscopic mucosal biopsies can help in identifying BE
patients at highest risk for EAC development, and whether some of the prevalent
mutations are "actionable", leading to improvements in current therapeutic
strategies for BE and EAC.

Here, we show for the first time, that the familial breast/ovarian cancer
susceptibility gene BRCA1 activates the Notch pathway in breast cells by
transcriptional upregulation of Notch ligands and receptors in both normal and
cancer cells. We demonstrate through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that
BRCA1 is localized to a conserved intronic enhancer region within the Notch
ligand Jagged-1 (JAG1) gene, an event requiring <U+0394>Np63. We propose that this
BRCA1/<U+0394>Np63-mediated induction of JAG1 may be important the regulation of breast 
stem/precursor cells, as knockdown of all three proteins resulted in increased
tumoursphere growth and increased activity of stem cell markers such as Aldehyde 
Dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1). Knockdown of Notch1 and JAG1 phenocopied BRCA1 knockdown
resulting in the loss of Estrogen Receptor-a (ER-a) expression and other luminal 
markers. A Notch mimetic peptide could activate an ER-a promoter reporter in a
BRCA1-dependent manner, whereas Notch inhibition using a <U+03B3>-secretase inhibitor
reversed this process. We demonstrate that inhibition of Notch signalling
resulted in decreased sensitivity to the anti-estrogen drug Tamoxifen but
increased expression of markers associated with basal-like breast cancer.
Together, these findings suggest that BRCA1 transcriptional upregulation of Notch
signalling is a key event in the normal differentiation process in breast tissue.

The tumor suppressor p53 was previously shown to markedly up-regulate the
expression of the PRODH gene, encoding the proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) enzyme, 
which catalyzes the first step in proline degradation. Also PRODH2, which
degrades 4-hydroxy-L-proline, a product of protein (e.g. collagen) catabolism,
was recently described as a p53 target. Here, we confirmed p53-dependent
induction of endogenous PRODH in response to genotoxic damage in cell lines of
different histological origin. We established that over-expression of TAp73ß or
TAp63ß is sufficient to induce PRODH expression in p53-null cells and that PRODH 
expression parallels the modulation of endogenous p73 by genotoxic drugs in
several cell lines. The p53, p63, and p73-dependent transcriptional activation
was linked to specific intronic response elements (REs), among those predicted by
bioinformatics tools and experimentally validated by a yeast-based
transactivation assay. p53 occupancy measurements were validated in HCT116 and
MCF7 human cell lines. Conversely, PRODH2 was not responsive to p63 nor p73 and, 
at best, could be considered a weak p53 target. In fact, minimal levels of PRODH2
transcript induction by genotoxic stress was observed exclusively in one of four 
p53 wild-type cell lines tested. Consistently, all predicted p53 REs in PRODH2
were poor matches to the p53 RE consensus and showed very weak responsiveness,
only to p53, in the functional assay. Taken together, our results highlight that 
PRODH, but not PRODH2, expression is under the control of p53 family members,
specifically p53 and p73. This supports a deeper link between proteins of the
p53-family and metabolic pathways, as PRODH modulates the balance of proline and 
glutamate levels and those of their derivative alpha-keto-glutarate (a-KG) under 
normal and pathological (tumor) conditions.

The airway epithelium in asthma displays altered repair and incomplete barrier
formation. Basal cells are the progenitor cells of the airway epithelium, and can
repopulate other cell types after injury. We previously reported increased
numbers of basal cells expressing the transcription factor p63 in the airway
epithelium of patients with asthma. Here we sought to determine the molecular
consequences of p63 expression in basal human airway epithelial cells during
wound repair. Because at least six isoforms of p63 exist (N-terminally truncated 
[<U+0394>N] versus transcriptional activation promoter variants and a, ß, or <U+03B3> 3' splice
variants), the expression of all isoforms was investigated in primary human
airway epithelial cells (pHAECs). We modulated p63 expression, using small
interfering RNA (siRNA) and adenoviral constructs to determine the effects of p63
on 21 candidate target genes by RT-PCR, and on repair using a scratch wound
assay. We found that basal pHAECs from asthmatic and nonasthmatic donors
predominantly expressed the N-terminally truncated p63a variant (<U+0394>Np63a) isoform,
with no disease-specific differences in expression. The knockdown of <U+0394>Np63, using
specific siRNA, decreased the expression of 11 out of 21 genes associated with
epithelial repair and differentiation, including ß-catenin, epidermal growth
factor receptor, and Jagged1. The loss of <U+0394>Np63 significantly inhibited wound
closure (which was associated with the decreased expression of ß-catenin and
Jagged1), reduced epithelial proliferation as measured by Ki-67 staining, and
increased E-cadherin expression, potentially preventing cytokinesis. In
conclusion, <U+0394>Np63a is the major isoform expressed in basal pHAECs, and is
essential for epithelial wound repair. The role of <U+0394>Np63a in epithelial barrier
integrity requires further study to understand its role in health and disease.

Corneal epithelial regeneration through ex vivo expansion of limbal stem cells
(LSCs) on 3T3-J2 fibroblasts has revealed some limitations mainly due to the
corneal microenvironment not being properly replicated, thus affecting long term 
results. Insights into the feeder cells that are used to expand LSCs and the
mechanisms underlying the effects of human feeder cells have yet to be fully
elucidated. We recently developed a standardized methodology to expand human
Tenon's fibroblasts (TFs). Here we aimed to investigate whether TFs can be
employed as feeder cells for LSCs, characterizing the phenotype of the
co-cultures and assessing what human soluble factors are secreted. The hypothesis
that TFs could be employed as alternative human feeder layer has not been
explored yet. LSCs were isolated from superior limbus biopsies, co-cultured on
TFs, 3T3-J2 or dermal fibroblasts (DFs), then analyzed by immunofluorescence
(p63a), colony-forming efficiency (CFE) assay and qPCR for a panel of putative
stem cell and epithelial corneal differentiation markers (KRT3). Co-cultures
supernatants were screened for a set of soluble factors. Results showed that the 
percentage of p63a(+)LSCs co-cultured onto TFs was significantly higher than
those on DFs (p = 0.032) and 3T3-J2 (p = 0.047). Interestingly, LSCs co-cultures 
on TFs exhibited both significantly higher CFE and mRNA expression levels of
<U+0394>Np63a than on 3T3-J2 and DFs (p < 0.0001), showing also significantly greater
levels of soluble factors (IL-6, HGF, b-FGF, G-CSF, TGF-ß3) than LSCs on DFs.
Therefore, TFs could represent an alternative feeder layer to both 3T3-J2 and
DFs, potentially providing a suitable microenvironment for LSCs culture.

The tumor protein p63/microRNA functional network appears to play a decisive role
in chemoresistance of human epithelial cancers. The cisplatin- and
phosphorylated-<U+0394>Np63a-dependent microRNAs, whose expression was varied in
sensitive and resistant squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC, which were derived
from larynx and tongue tumors), were shown to modulate the expression of multiple
members of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy pathways. The specific
microRNAs were further shown to modulate the resistant phenotype of SCC cells in 
vitro, thereby providing groundwork for novel chemotherapeutic venues for head
and neck cancer.

AIMS: Immature squamous metaplasia of the pancreatic duct (ISMPD) can be
difficult to differentiate from an intraductal carcinoma of the pancreas (ICP),
and little is known about the pathological nature of ISMPD. The aim of this study
was to analyse 20 ISMPD and 10 ICP tissue samples.
METHODS AND RESULTS: ISMPD shares some characteristics with ICP. Seven of 20
ISMPD samples were covered by a layer of pancreatic duct epithelium, whereas this
was not seen in the ICP samples. Immunohistochemistry of ISMPD revealed
positivity for p63 (100%), cytokeratin 5/6 (95%), cytokeratin 7 (95%),
cytokeratin 20 (10%), and MUC-1 (95%), and the samples were negative for p53,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and bcl-2. In contrast, ICP was positive for p63 
(40%), p53 (10%), cytokeratin 7 (90%), cytokeratin 20 (20%), CEA (30%), and MUC-1
(80%), and negative for cytokeratin 5/6. However, in 84% (16) of the ISMPD
samples, cytokeratin 7 was expressed only by an epithelial layer at the apical
surface; this expression pattern was not found in any of the 10 ICP samples. The 
mean Ki67 labelling index was 1.0% in ISMPD and 18.5% in ICP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin
5/6 and Ki67 constitutes the best combination for differentiating ISMPD from ICP.

Spheroid models have led to an increased understanding of differentiation, tissue
organization and homeostasis. In the present study, we have observed that under a
serum-free medium, human dental pulp cells (DPCs) spontaneously formed spheroids,
and could survive over 15 weeks. To characterize these spheroids, we investigated
their dynamics, microenvironment, cell distribution, molecular profiles, and
neuronal/osteogenic potential. Cell tracking assay showed that cells inside the
spheroids have very slow cycling. Although the spheroids had hypoxia
microenvironments, there were not any massive cell die-offs even after long-term 
cultivation. Whole mount immunofluorescence staining and histological analysis
showed a distribution of stem cells in the central/intermediate zones of
spheroids. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of stemness markers 
NANOG, TP63, and CD44 in the spheroids were much higher than within the monolayer
cultures. Gene expression levels of neural markers CDH2, NFM, TUBB3, and CD24 in 
the spheroids were much higher than the monolayer DPCs and increased in a culture
time-dependent manner. Without any neural induction, spheroid-derived cells
spontaneously converted into neuron-like cells with positive staining of neural
markers HuC/D and P75 under the serum-free medium for about 2 weeks. When the
spheroids were transferred into osteogenic medium, they rapidly differentiated
into osteo/odontogenic cells, especially the central original cells. Compared to 
the monolayer DPCs, mineralization in spheroids were significantly increased.
This spheroid model offers a study tool to explore the molecular bases of stem
cell homeostasis and tissue organization, and can be wildly used for nerve tissue
and bone regeneration.

Science and Research, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.

AIM: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) may be preceded by potentially malignant
disorders such as leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis (OSF). p63 in concert
with p53 regulates cell proliferation and differentiation and may have a role in 
potentially malignant and malignant lesions of the oral cavity. The aim of the
study was to evaluate and compare the expression of p53 and p63 proteins in OSCC,
leukoplakia, and OSF by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
METHODS: Tissue sections of OSCC (n = 20), leukoplakia (n = 20), OSF (n = 20) and
normal oral mucosa (n = 10) were stained with p53 and p63 antibodies by IHC. Mean
labeling index (LI) among the study groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis
test.
RESULTS: The mean LI of p53 for OSCC, leukoplakia, OSF, and normal mucosa were
56.9 ± 21.3, 37.6 ± 12.6, 34.6 ± 8.7 and 15.1 ± 9, while mean LI of p63 were
56.8 ± 19.6, 42.3 ± 10.5, 32.8 ± 12.1, and 26.4 ± 9.4. The mean LI of p53 and p63
were significantly higher in OSCC, leukoplakia and OSF compared to normal mucosa 
(P < 0.01; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The significant increase in expression of p53 and p63 proteins in
OSCC, leukoplakia, and OSF suggests their role as surrogate markers of malignant 
transformation.

Human Ectrodactyly, Ectodermal dysplasia, Clefting (EEC) syndrome is an autosomal
dominant developmental disorder defined by limb deformities, skin defects, and
craniofacial clefting. Although associated with heterozygous missense mutations
in TP63, the genetic basis underlying the variable expressivity and incomplete
penetrance of EEC is unknown. Here, we show that mice heterozygous for an allele 
encoding the Trp63 p.Arg318His mutation, which corresponds to the human TP63
p.Arg279His mutation found in patients with EEC, have features of human EEC.
Using an allelic series, we discovered that whereas clefting and skin defects are
caused by loss of Trp63 function, limb anomalies are due to gain- and/or
dominant-negative effects of Trp63. Furthermore, we identify TAp63 as a strong
modifier of EEC-associated phenotypes with regard to both penetrance and
expressivity.

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with aberrant diffuse expression of p63 (p63-PCa) is a
recently described variant of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was
to investigate the clinical and pathologic features of p63-PCa at radical
prostatectomy (RP). We reviewed 21 cases of p63-PCa diagnosed on needle biopsy at
subsequent RP. Immunohistochemical analysis for PIN4 and Ki-67 was performed in
all RP cases. p63-PCa showed a distinctive morphology consisting of atrophic,
poorly formed glands, with multilayered and often spindled nuclei. Gleason
grading was 3+3=6 in 28.5%, 3+5=8 in 38%, 3+4=7 in 14.3%, and 4+3=7, 5+3=8, and
5+4=9 in 9.5%. Usual-type acinar carcinoma coexisted in 85.7% with only p63-PCa
present in the remaining cases. The usual-type carcinoma was Gleason grade 3+2=5 
in 4.7%, 3+3=6 in 57%, 3+4=7 in 19%, and 4+3=7 in 4.3%. Overall, p63-PCa
represented 65% of the total cancer volume (median 80%). The tumor was
organ-confined in 16 cases (76.2%). In the remaining 5 cases, 2 had p63-PCa
extending to the margin in areas of intraprostatic incisions, 2 had usual-type
acinar adenocarcinoma extending to the margin and extraprostatic tissue,
respectively, and 1 had p63-PCa with an unusual cribriform morphology involving
the bladder neck. Ki-67 was low, <5% in all cases of p63-PCa, with similar
expression in the coexisting acinar-type carcinoma. In summary, it is recommended
that these tumors not be assigned a Gleason score and their favorable findings at
RP be noted.

PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to identify the mutation gene of a Chinese
family with anorectal malformation (ARM) associated with split hand-foot
malformation and to determine the spatiotemporal expression of the mutated gene
during hindgut and anorectum development in human embryos.
METHOD: A Chinese family with intrafamilial clinically variable manifestation was
analyzed and primers were designed for exons 3-14 of P63, DLX5, DLX6, DAC, and
HOXD13 as candidate genes and direct sequence analysis of the exons was
performed. Immunohistochemical study of mutated gene in the hindgut and anorectum
of human embryos of 4th-10th weeks was performed.
RESULT: Affected individuals were found to have an Arg227Gln P63 gene mutation.
From the 4th-10th weeks of gestation of the human embryo, the P63-positive cells 
were mainly located on the epithelium of the apical urorectal septum, hindgut,
and cloacal membrane. After the anorectum ruptured during the 8th week, the P63
remained strongly immunoreactive on the epithelium of the anal canal and urethra,
but the mucous membrane of the rectum exhibited no reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The mutation identified strongly suggests a causal relationship
between the ARM phenotype and P63. The expression of P63 was persistently active 
during the dynamic and incessant septation of the cloaca and hindgut, suggesting 
that P63 may play a pivotal role in the morphogenesis of the hindgut and
anorectum.

Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) cells play a pivotal role during root
formation of the tooth and are able to form cementum-like tissue. The aim of the 
present study was to establish a HERS cell line for molecular and biochemical
studies using a selective digestion method. Selective digestion was performed by 
the application of trypsin-EDTA for 2 min, which led to the detachment of
fibroblast-like-cells, with the rounded cells attached to the culture plate. The 
HERS cells displayed a typical cuboidal/squamous-shaped appearance.
Characterization of the HERS cells using immunofluorescence staining and flow
cytometry analysis showed that these cells expressed pan-cytokeratin, E-cadherin,
and p63 as epithelial markers. Moreover, RT-PCR confirmed that these cells
expressed epithelial-related genes, such as cytokeratin 14, E-cadherin, and
<U+0394>Np63. Additionally, HERS cells showed low expression of CD44 and CD105 with
absence of CD34 and amelogenin expressions. In conclusion, HERS cells have been
successfully isolated using a selective digestion method, thus enabling future
studies on the roles of these cells in the formation of cementum-like tissue in
vitro.

p63 is a p53 family transcription factor, which besides unique roles in
epithelial development, shares tumor suppressive activity with its homolog p53.
The p63 gene has different transcriptional start sites, which generate two
N-terminal isoforms (transactivation domain (TA)p63 and amino terminal truncated 
protein(<U+0394>N)p63); in addition alternative splicing at the 5'-end give rise to at
least five C-terminal isoforms. This complexity of gene structure has probably
fostered the debate and controversy on p63 function in cancer, with
TP63-harboring two distinctive promoters, codifying for the TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63
isoforms, and having discrete functions. However, <U+0394>Np63 also drives expression of
target genes that have a relevant role in cancer and metastasis. In this study,
we identified a novel p63 transcriptional target, caspase-1. Caspase-1 is
proinflammatory caspase, which functions in tumor suppression. We show that both 
p63 isoforms promote caspase-1 expression by physical binding to its promoter.
Consistent with our in vitro findings, we also identified a direct correlation
between p63 and caspase-1 expression in human cancer data sets. In addition,
survival estimation analysis demonstrated that functional interaction between p63
and caspase-1 represents a predictor of positive survival outcome in human
cancers. Overall, our data report a novel p63 target gene involved in tumor
suppression, and the clinical analysis underlines the biological relevance of
this finding and suggests a further clinically predictive biomarker.

15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase-derived 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 inhibits

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent lipid mediator that plays a key role in
inflammation and carcinogenesis. NAD(+)-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of
PGE2, which leads to PGE2 biotransformation. In this study, we showed that the
15-PGDH-derived 15-keto-PGE2 is an endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-<U+03B3> (PPAR-<U+03B3>) ligand that causes PPAR-<U+03B3> dissociation from Smad2/3, allowing
Smad2/3 association with the TGF-ß receptor I and Smad anchor for receptor
activation and subsequent Smad2/3 phosphorylation and transcription activation in
human cholangiocarcinoma cells. The 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-induced Smad2/3
phosphorylation resulted in the formation of the pSmad2/3-TAP63-p53 ternary
complex and their binding to the TAP63 promoter, inducing TAP63
autotranscription. The role of TAP63 in 15-PGDH/15-keto-PGE2-induced inhibition
of tumor growth was further supported by the observation that knockdown of TAP63 
prevented 15-PGDH-induced inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, colony
formation, and migration. These findings disclose a novel 15-PGDH-mediated
15-keto-PGE2 signaling cascade that interacts with PPAR-<U+03B3>, Smad2/3, and TAP63.

Deregulation of the hedgehog (HH) pathway results in overexpression of the GLI
target BCL2 and is an initiating event in specific tumor types including basal
cell carcinoma of the skin. Regulation of the HH pathway during keratinocyte
differentiation is not well understood. We measured HH pathway activity in
response to differentiation stimuli in keratinocytes. An upregulation of
suppressor of fused (SUFU), a negative regulator of the HH pathway, lowered HH
pathway activity and was accompanied by loss of BCL2 expression associated with
keratinocyte differentiation. We used in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate 
that <U+0394>Np63a, a crucial regulator of epidermal development, activates SUFU
transcription in keratinocytes. Increasing SUFU protein levels inhibited
GLI-mediated gene activation in suprabasal keratinocytes and promoted
differentiation. Loss of SUFU expression caused deregulation of keratinocyte
differentiation and BCL2 overexpression. Using in vivo murine models, we also
provide evidence of GLI-mediated regulation of the TP63 pathway. p63 expression
appears essential to establish an optimally functioning HH pathway. These
observations present a regulatory mechanism by which SUFU acts as an interacting 
node between the HH and TP63 pathways to mediate differentiation and maintain
epidermal homeostasis. Disruption of this regulatory node can be an important
contributor to multistep carcinogenesis.

AIMS: p63 is one of the standard markers for basal cells of the prostate gland.
Recently, it has been suggested that the p63 isoform p40 might be more specific
as a basal cell marker. In this study we compare the staining characteristics of 
p63 and p40 in normal and malignant prostate tissues.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A prostatectomy cohort (n = 640) in tissue microarray format
was evaluated for p63 (clone 4A4) and for p40 (rabbit polyclonal)
immunoreactivity in malignant and normal tissues. Immunoreactivity of basal and
secretory cells was evaluated in a semiquantitative manner and compared
case-wise. In normal tissues, p40 showed highly similar immunoreactivity compared
to p63. The staining patterns were absolutely identical in 88% of cases.
Additional cytoplasmic p40 staining in tumour cells occurred in 59.6% of cancer
cases. Differences were seen in nuclear staining of carcinomas: 1.4% of
carcinomas were p63-positive, whereas 0.6% were p40-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: In most cases, p40 stains prostatic basal cells as reliably as p63, 
with only minor differences. Aberrant staining of tumour cells is seen more
rarely than with p63 (clone 4A4), establishing its higher specificity. However,
additional cytoplasmic immunoreactivity narrows its eligibility for antibody
cocktails (e.g. with alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase).

Several lines of evidence suggest that specific transcriptional events are
involved in cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation processes; however,
their deregulation by proto-oncogenes are involved in the development of leukemia
and tumors. One such proto-oncogene is ecotropic viral integration site I which
can differentially effect cell cycle progression and proliferation, in cell types
of different origin. Our data for the first time shows that ecotropic viral
integration site I binds to <U+0394>Np63 promoter element directly and down regulates
its expression. Down regulation of <U+0394>Np63 induces the expression of p21 in HT-29
cells and also in colon carcinoma cells that do not express p53 including patient
samples expressing low level of p53, that eventually delay cell cycle progression
at G0/G1 phase. Concomitant silencing of ecotropic viral integration site I from 
the cells or introduction of <U+0394>Np63 to the cells significantly rescued this
phenotype, indicating the growth defect induced by <U+0394>Np63 deficiency to be, at
least in part, attributable to ecotropic viral integration site I function. The
mutual regulation between ecotropic viral integration site I and <U+0394>Np63 may
constitute a novel axis which might affect the downstream pathways in cells that 
do not express functional p53.

Tumor suppressor genes associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer
(review).

Ovarian cancer is a fatal gynecological cancer and a major cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide. The main limitation to a successful treatment
for ovarian cancer is the development of drug resistance to combined
chemotherapy. Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are wild-type alleles of genes which 
play regulatory roles in diverse cellular activities, and whose loss of function 
contributes to the development of cancer. It has been demonstrated that TSGs
contribute to drug resistance in several types of solid tumors. However, an
overview of the contribution of TSGs to drug resistance in ovarian cancer has not
previously been reported. In this study, 15 TSGs responding to drug resistance in
ovarian cancer were reviewed to determine the relationship of TSGs with ovarian
cancer drug resistance. Furthermore, gene/protein-interaction and bio-association
analysis were performed to demonstrate the associations of these TSGs and to mine
the potential drug resistance-related genes in ovarian cancer. We observed that
the 15 TSGs had close interactions with each other, suggesting that they may
contribute to drug resistance in ovarian cancer as a group. Five
pathways/processes consisting of DNA damage, apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA binding
and methylation may be the key ways with which TSGs participate in the regulation
of drug resistance. In addition, ubiquitin C (UBC) and six additional TSGs
including the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), death associated protein
kinase gene (DAPK), pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 (PLAGL1), retinoblastoma
susceptibility gene (RB1), a gene encoding an apoptosis-associated speck-like
protein (PYCARD/ASC) and tumor protein 63 (TP63), which had close interactions
with the 15 TSGs, are potential drug resistance-related genes in ovarian cancer.

The transcription factor p63 is central for epithelial homeostasis and
development. In our model of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human 
prostate cells, p63 was one of the most down-regulated transcription factors
during EMT. We therefore investigated the role of p63 in EMT. Over-expression of 
the predominant epithelial isoform <U+0394>Np63a in mesenchymal type cells of the model 
led to gain of several epithelial characteristics without resulting in a complete
mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). This was corroborated by a reciprocal
effect when p63 was knocked down in epithelial EP156T cells. Global gene
expression analyses showed that <U+0394>Np63a induced gene modules involved in both
cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular-matrix junctions in mesenchymal type
cells. Genome-wide analysis of p63 binding sites using ChIP-seq analyses
confirmed binding of p63 to regulatory areas of genes associated with cell
adhesion in prostate epithelial cells. DH1 and ZEB1 are two elemental factors in 
the control of EMT. Over-expression and knock-down of these factors,
respectively, were not sufficient alone or in combination with <U+0394>Np63a to reverse 
completely the mesenchymal phenotype. The partial reversion of epithelial to
mesenchymal transition might reflect the ability of <U+0394>Np63a, as a key co-ordinator
of several epithelial gene expression modules, to reduce epithelial to
mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). The utility of <U+0394>Np63a expression and the potential 
of reduced EMP in order to counteract metastasis warrant further investigation.

Chronic stress is a risk factor for several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as
depression and psychosis. In response to stress glucocorticoids (GCs) are
secreted that bind to mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors,
ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the transcription of gene
networks in the brain necessary for coping with stress, recovery, and adaptation.
Chronic stress particularly affects the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the
hippocampus, causing several functional and morphological changes with
consequences for learning and memory, which are likely adaptive but at the same
time make DG neurons more vulnerable to subsequent challenges. The aim of this
study was to investigate the transcriptional response of DG neurons to a GC
challenge in male rats previously exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS). An
intriguing finding of the current study was that having a history of CRS had
profound consequences for the subsequent response to acute GC challenge,
differentially affecting the expression of several hundreds of genes in the DG
compared with challenged nonstressed control animals. This enduring effect of
previous stress exposure suggests that epigenetic processes may be involved. In
line with this, CRS indeed affected the expression of several genes involved in
chromatin structure and epigenetic processes, including Asf1, Ash1l, Hist1h3f,
and Tp63. The data presented here indicate that CRS alters the transcriptional
response to a subsequent GC injection. We propose that this altered
transcriptional potential forms part of the molecular mechanism underlying the
enhanced vulnerability for stress-related disorders like depression caused by
chronic stress.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the pathological and clinical meaning of p63 in
extranodal nasal type NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL).
METHODS: We detected p63 and p53 expression using immunohistochemistry staining
in 84 cases of NKTCL from Southern of China, an area with a well known high
incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is closely associated with
Epstein-Barr virus infection. Moreover, we analysed the relationship between p63 
and p53 expression and the clinicopathological features of NKTCL.
RESULTS: Our results first showed that p63 expression was found in 14.3% (12/84) 
of NKTCL compared with 6.6% (2/30) in reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of
nasopharynx. p63 Expression rate in NKTCL was significantly higher than that in
reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of nasopharynx (p=0.016). NKTCL patients with p63
positivity had poorer 5-year overall survival rate (29.2%) than that (49.9%) of
p63 negativity. p53 expression was found in 33.3% (28/84) of NKTCL. Our data
showed that p53 expression was significantly associated with tumour stage
(p=0.016) and international prognostic index (p=0.026) in patients with NKTCL.
Cox regression test showed that p53 expression rate and international prognostic 
index score were statistically independent prognostic factors for NKTCL patients 
(p=0.002 and p=0.016, respectively). Our results suggest that p63 and p53 might
play a role in pathogenesis of NKTCL.

A male child with clinical features consistent with EEC/EECUT plus syndrome
(ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting, urinary tract abnormalities, and
thymic abnormalities) including mild ectodermal abnormalities, ectrodactyly of
hands and feet, cleft palate, bilateral hydronephrosis, and T cell lymphopenia is
reported. He was noted to have T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis
below the cutoff for normal on newborn screening and T cell lymphopenia on
further immunologic evaluation. A novel, presumably pathogenic de novo 3<U+2009>bp
deletion in exon 7 of TP63 (c.970_972delATT; NCBI Reference Sequence NM_003722.4)
was identified. This observation provides supporting evidence for the association
between TP63 mutations and EECUT plus syndrome. Clinicians caring for infants
presenting with EEC spectrum disorders in the newborn period should also consider
the possibility of T cell lymphopenia.

Sparse hair, dysplastic nails and hypohidrosis were subsequently noted. With
exception of speech related issues, her development was normal. A clinical
diagnosis of ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate or Hay-Wells
syndrome resulted in TP63 sequence analysis. TP63 sequence and
deletion/duplication analysis of all coding exons had a normal result, as did
chromosome and SNP array analysis. Diagnostic exome analysis revealed a
heterozygous nonsense mutation in KRT83 categorized as deleterious and associated
with monilethrix. In addition, a homozygous missense variant of unknown clinical 
significance was reported in RIPK4. Using research based exome analysis, RIPK4
had just a few months prior been identified as pathogenic for Bartsocas-Papas
syndrome. While the clinical diagnostic report implied the KRT83 mutation as a
more likely cause for the patient's phenotype, clinical correlation, literature
review and use of computerized mutation analysis programs allowed us to identify 
the homozygous RIPK4 (c.488G > A; p.Gly163Asp) mutation as the underlying
pathogenic change. Consequently, we expand the phenotype of Bartsocas-Papas
syndrome to an attenuated presentation resembling Hay-Wells syndrome, lacking
lethality and pterygia. In contrast to the autosomal dominant Hay-Wells syndrome,
Bartsocas-Papas syndrome is autosomal recessive, implying a 25% recurrence risk.

BACKGROUND: p63 proteins are important in formation of the oral mucosa. Normal
oral mucosa shows a balance between the six protein isoforms, whereas an
imbalance between them is seen in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). There is
controversy over the clinical impact of p63 in SCC, which may relate to different
expression in different areas. In addition, p63 isoforms can act as p53-like
molecules (TAp63) or can inhibit p53 functions (<U+0394>Np63) and expression of these
isoforms varies in different tumours. Here, we chose to concentrate on the most
common intra-oral sub-site, SCC of the mobile tongue.
METHODS: Total p63, <U+0394>Np63 and TAp63 were analysed separately using
immunohistochemistry. The percentage of cells and intensity of expression of
different isoforms of p63 was evaluated using a quick score method and correlated
with clinical data in a group of 87 patients with tongue SCC.
RESULTS: All tumours expressed p63 in at least 60% of the cells when using two
different antibodies detecting all 6 isoforms. p63 expression correlated
significantly with 2-year survival (P = 0.018), with fewer patients surviving 2
years if their tumours expressed p63 with strong intensity in at least 80% of the
cells (quick score 18). Looking at 5-year survival, this was even more
emphasized. <U+0394>Np63 was expressed in all tumours, whereas expression of TAp63 was
seen only in 59/87 patients, usually at very low levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present data, we recommend using expression of p63 as
an additional factor contributing prognostic information in analysis of SCC in
the tongue.

OBJECTIVE: To study the regulation of P63 on expression of MASPIN in ovarian
cancer by observe MASPIN promoter activity changes before and after transient
transfection of constructed P63 and MASPIN reporter gene plasmids.
METHODS: The MASPIN reporter plasmid, fused with luciferase reporter gene, was
constructed and transfected into SKOV3 cells together with P63 (TAP63, ANP63)
express plasmid transiently. The MASPIN promoter activity was determined in both 
the transfected cells and controlled ones by Luciferase Assays and the
transcription of MASPIN mRNA of them was evaluated with semi quantitative RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The MASPIN reporter plasmid was successfully constructed and transiently
transfected into SKOV3 cells together with P63 (TAP63, ANP63) expression plasmid.
The data showed among the tested P63 splice variants, TAP63 remarkably activated 
MASPIN promoter transactivation (P < 0.05). No significant difference in the
activity level of MASPIN promoter was detected in the SKOV3-vector and
SKOV3-ANP63 cells (P > 0.05). The level of MASPIN mRNA expression was notably
enhanced in SKOV3-TAP63 cell after transient transfected with TAP63 express
plasmid (P < 0.05), but no significant difference among the SKOV3, SKOV3-vector
and SKOV3-ANP63 cell (P > 0.05) was detected.
CONCLUSION: TAP63 can activate the transcription activity of MASPIN promoter, as 
well as regulate the expression of MASPIN. Put all together, these results
suggested that MASPIN is a new molecular target of P63.

distinction from basaloid squamous cell carcinoma.

Basal cell carcinoma of the anal region is rare and morphologically difficult to 
distinguish from basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, particularly on biopsies. This
distinction has therapeutic and prognostic implications. We reviewed
morphological features of 9 basal cell carcinomas and 15 basaloid squamous cell
carcinomas from the anal region diagnosed during 1993-2011 and determined the
utility of Ber-EP4, BCL2, TP63, CK5/6, CDKN2A, and SOX2 as diagnostic tools.
Immunostains were scored in a semi-quantitative manner (1+-1-10%, 2+-11-50%,
3+->50%). All basal cell carcinomas were located in the perianal region, while
all basaloid squamous cell carcinomas originated in the anal canal/anorectum.
Nodular subtype of basal cell carcinoma was the most common subtype. Retraction
artifact was the only significant distinguishing histological feature of basal
cell carcinoma compared with basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (88% vs 26%;
P=0.04). Atypical mitoses were more common in basaloid squamous cell carcinomas
(71% vs 11%; P=0.05). An in situ component was only present in basaloid squamous 
cell carcinomas, and was noted in 6/15 cases. Basal cell carcinomas had 2-3+
Ber-EP4 (basal cell carcinoma 100% vs basaloid squamous cell carcinoma 40%;
P<0.001) and BCL2 immunoreactivity (basal cell carcinomas 100% vs basaloid
squamous cell carcinoma 33%; P<0.001). Diffuse CDKN2A and SOX2 expression was
seen only in basaloid squamous cell carcinomas (basal cell carcinoma 0% vs
basaloid squamous cell carcinoma 93%; P<0.001). There was no difference in TP63
and CK5/6 expression. Perianal location, retraction artifact, and lack of
atypical mitoses are histological features that help distinguish basal cell
carcinoma from basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. An in situ component, when
present, supports the diagnosis of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Immunostains
are extremely helpful as diffuse Ber-EP4 and BCL2 expression is a feature of
basal cell carcinoma and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is typified by diffuse 
CDKN2A and SOX2 expression.

Previously, we reported that I<U+03BA>B kinase-ß(IKKß) phosphorylates and stabilizes
TAp63<U+03B3>. However, the effect of this phosphorylation on TAp63<U+03B3> transcriptional
activity remains unclear. In this study, we showed that overexpression of IKKß,
but not its kinase dead mutant and IKKa, can surprisingly inhibit TAp63<U+03B3>
transcriptional activity as measured by luciferase assays and real-time PCR
analyses of p63 target genes. This inhibition was impaired by ACHP, an IKKß
inhibitor, and enhanced by TNFa that activates IKKß. Consistently, IKKß inhibited
the binding between TAp63<U+03B3> and p300, a co-activator of TAp63<U+03B3>, and consequently
counteracted the positive effect of p300 on TAp63<U+03B3> transcriptional activity.
Through phosphorylation site prediction and mass spectrometry, we identified that
Ser-4 and Ser-12 of p63 are IKKß-targeting residues. As expected, IKKß fails to
suppress the transcriptional activity of the S4A/S12A double mutant p63. These
results indicate that IKKß can suppress TAp63<U+03B3> activity by interfering with the
interaction between TAp63<U+03B3> and p300.

<U+0394>Np63a represses nuclear translocation of PTEN by inhibition of NEDD4-1 in
keratinocytes.

<U+0394>Np63a maintains the proliferative potential of keratinocytes by inhibiting the
transcription and nuclear localization of the tumor suppressor PTEN as shown
earlier by our laboratory. The goal of this study was to define the mechanisms by
which <U+0394>Np63a mediates the nuclear exclusion of PTEN. We demonstrate here that
<U+0394>Np63a reduces the ubiquitination of PTEN, a key signaling event in the nuclear
translocation of PTEN. The decrease in ubiquitinated PTEN correlated with the
ability of <U+0394>Np63a to bind to neuronal precursor developmentally down regulated 4 
(NEDD4) promoter and transcriptionally repress the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1.
Knockdown of NEDD4-1 in cultured keratinocytes was sufficient to attenuate the
increase in nuclear PTEN observed upon silencing of <U+0394>Np63a. In vivo examination
of normal skin demonstrated that <U+0394>Np63a and NEDD4-1 were both expressed in the
basal layer of the epidermis and this correlated with nuclear exclusion of PTEN. 
Altogether, these studies suggest that <U+0394>Np63a-mediated suppression of nuclear
PTEN in basal layer keratinocytes occurs through repression of NEDD4-1.

Lower urinary tract and/or kidney malformations are collectively the most common 
cause of end-stage renal disease in children, and they are also likely to account
for a major subset of young adults requiring renal replacement therapy. Advances 
have been made regarding the discovery of the genetic causes of human kidney
malformations. Indeed, testing for mutations of key nephrogenesis genes is now
feasible for patients seen in nephrology clinics. Unfortunately, less is known
about defined genetic bases of human lower urinary tract anomalies. The focus of 
this review is the genetic bases of congenital structural and functional
disorders of the urinary bladder. Three are highlighted. First, prune belly
syndrome, where mutations of CHRM3, encoding an acetylcholine receptor, HNF1B,
encoding a transcription factor, and ACTA2, encoding a cytoskeletal protein, have
been reported. Second, the urofacial syndrome, where mutations of LRIG2 and
HPSE2, encoding proteins localised in nerves invading the fetal bladder, have
been defined. Finally, we review emerging evidence that bladder exstrophy may
have genetic bases, including variants in the TP63 promoter. These genetic
discoveries provide a new perspective on a group of otherwise poorly understood
diseases.

Identification of p63+ keratinocyte progenitor cells in circulation and their
matrix-directed differentiation to epithelial cells.

Nair RP, Krishnan LK.

INTRODUCTION: In the event of chronic diabetes or burn wounds, accomplishing skin
regeneration is a major concern. Autologous skin grafting is the most effective
remedy, but the tissue harvest may create more nonhealing wounds. Currently
available skin substitutes have a limited clinical outcome because of immune
reactions arising from the xenobiotic scaffold or allogenous cells. Autologous
stem cells that can be collected without an additional injury may be a viable
option for skin-tissue engineering. Presence of a low number of keratinocyte
progenitor cells (KPCs) within the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC)
population has been indicated. Identification, isolation, expansion, and
differentiation of KPCs is necessary before they are considered for skin
regeneration, which is the focus of this study.
METHODS: Culture of isolated human PBMNCs on a cell-specific matrix was carried
out to induce differentiation of KPCs. Flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction were done for epithelial stem cell marker p63 and
lineage markers cytokeratin 5 and cytokeratin 14, to track differentiation.
Proliferation was confirmed by quantifying the proliferating cell nuclear
antigen-expressing cells. Immunostaining with epithelial cell markers, involucrin
and filaggrin, was carried out to establish terminal differentiation. Microscopic
analysis confirmed growth and survival of KPCs on the dermal fibroblast monolayer
and on a transplantable fibrin sheet.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that KPCs are p63(+) and CD34-. The specifically
designed composition of the extracellular matrix was found to support selective
adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of p63(+) KPCs. The PBMNC culture
for 12 days under controlled conditions resulted in a homogenous population that 
expressed cytokeratins, and >90% of the cells were found to proliferate.
Subculture for 5 days resulted in expression of filaggrin and involucrin,
suggesting terminal differentiation. Transfer of matrix-selected KPCs to a dermal
fibroblast monolayer or fibrin supported cell proliferation and showed typical
hexagonal morphology of keratinocytes within 15 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating KPCs were identified with p63, which differentiated into
keratinocytes with expression of the cytokeratins, involucrin and filaggrin.
Components of the specifically designed matrix favored KPC attachment, directed
differentiation, and may turn out to be a potential vehicle for cell
transplantation.

The transcription factor p63 is critical for many biological processes, including
development and maintenance of epidermal tissues and tumorigenesis. Here, we
report that the TAp63 isoforms regulate cell metabolism through the induction of 
the mitochondrial glutaminase 2 (GLS2) gene both in primary cells and tumor cell 
lines. By ChIP analysis and luciferase assay, we confirmed that TAp63 binds
directly to the p53/p63 consensus DNA binding sequence within the GLS2 promoter
region. Given the critical role of p63 in epidermal differentiation, we have
investigated the regulation of GLS2 expression during this process. GLS2 and
TAp63 expression increases during the in vitro differentiation of primary human
keratinocytes, and depletion of GLS2 inhibits skin differentiation both at
molecular and cellular levels. We found that GLS2 and TAp63 expression are
concomitantly induced in cancer cells exposed to oxidative stresses.
siRNA-mediated depletion of GLS2 sensitizes cells to ROS-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that the TAp63/GLS2 axis can be functionally important as a cellular
antioxidant pathway in the absence of p53. Accordingly, we found that GLS2 is
upregulated in colon adenocarcinoma. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that
GLS2 is a bona fide TAp63 target gene, and that the TAp63-dependent regulation of
GLS2 is important for both physiological and pathological processes.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SQCCL) remains a leading cause of
cancer-related death. Unlike non-smoker adenocarcinoma of the lung, where highly 
efficient tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available for treating mutant EGFR or
ALK-rearranged, no targetable biomarkers are available for SQCCL. The frequent
and focal amplification of FGFR1 has generated great expectations in offering new
therapeutical options in case of 16-22% of SQCCL patients. Broad 3q chromosome
amplification is widely recognized as the most common chromosomal aberration
found in SQCCL, where PIK3CA, SOX2, ACK1, PRKCI, TP63, PLD1, ECT2, and others
genes are located. Although SOX2 has been postulated as a key regulator of basal 
stem cells transformation and tumor progression, it seems to confer a good
prognosis in SQCCL. It is known that each patient might carry a different length 
of 3q chromosome amplicon. Thus, we suggest that the number and the biological
importance of the genes spanned along each patient's 3q amplicon might help to
explain inter-individual outcome variations of the disease and its potential
predictive value, especially when relevant oncogenes such as those mentioned
above are implicated. Currently, there is no clinical predictive data available
from clinical trials. In this review, we have focused on the potential role of
FGFR1 in SQCCL prognosis. Additionally, we have explored recently available
public data on the comprehensive genomic characterization of SQCCL, in relation
to the protein-coding genes that have a strong gene copy number - mRNA
correlation in 3q chromosome, that were previously described as potential driver 
oncogenes or its modifiers in SQCCL.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) is a
complex disease associated with both genetic and environmental factors. One
strategy for identifying of possible NSCL/P genetic causes is to evaluate
polymorphic variants in genes involved in the craniofacial development.
DESIGN: We carried out a case-control analysis of 13 single nucleotide
polymorphisms in 9 genes related to craniofacial development, including TBX1,
PVRL1, MID1, RUNX2, TP63, TGFß3, MSX1, MYH9 and JAG2, in 367 patients with NSCL/P
and 413 unaffected controls from Brazil to determine their association with
NSCL/P.
RESULTS: Four out of 13 polymorphisms (rs28649236 and rs4819522 of TBX1,
rs7940667 of PVRL1 and rs1057744 of JAG2) were presented in our population.
Comparisons of allele and genotype frequencies revealed that the G variant allele
and the AG/GG genotypes of TBX1 rs28649236 occurred in a frequency significantly 
higher in controls than in the NSCL/P group (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25-0.67;
p=0.0002). The frequencies of rs4819522, rs7940667 and rs1057744 minor alleles
and genotypes were similar between control and NSCL/P group, without significant 
differences. No significant associations among cleft types and polymorphisms were
observed.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests for the first time evidences to an association of 
the G allele of TBX1 rs28649236 polymorphism and NSCL/P.

BACKGROUND: The contribution of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors Snail
and Slug to invasion and metastasis has strengthened the evidence for the
importance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinoma progression.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has described the
immunohistochemical staining of the EMT-related proteins Snail/Slug in skin
tumors and the correlation between Snail/Slug and tumor suppressor p53/p63.
METHODS: We performed immunohistological staining of Snail, Slug, E-cadherin, p53
and p63 in 20 archived specimens each of seborrheic keratosis (SK), actinic
keratosis (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS), and 53 specimens of
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Fifteen normal skin (NS) specimens
served as controls.
RESULTS: Significant negative correlations were observed between Snail and
E-cadherin expression and between Slug and E-cadherin expression (Snail: R(2) =
0.5432, p < 0.01; Slug: R(2) = 0.4666, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The staining intensities of Snail and Slug are associated with
decreased E-cadherin staining in SCC and this may promote EMT. However, the
staining intensities of p53 and p63 are not significantly correlated with the
loss of E-cadherin.

To analyse the relationship of the immunohistochemical p63 expression with
tumoral extent, histologic grade, lymph node involvement and clinical stage in
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), a series of 81 patients with primary
LSCC treated by primary surgery was retrospectively evaluated.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks from surgical samples. Clinicopathologic data were correlated with the p63
staining results. Differences in p63 immunoreactivity between the different
groups were compared using both parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Statistical significance was set at p less
than 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical
package. We found a statistically significant association between p63 protein
expression and increase of tumor extension (T1 vs T3), of histological grading,
of level of lymph node involvement (N0 vs N1 and N2), and clinical stage (I vs
IV). Our findings suggest that abnormal expression of p63 may be involved in the 
early phases of laryngeal tumorigenesis and this oncoprotein might become a
useful predictor of clinical outcome.

<U+0394>Np63 (henceforth simply p40) is a squamous/basal-type biomarker corresponding to
nontransactivating (non-TA) isoforms of p63 gene. Its prospective relevance as
driver biomarker in lung cancer has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In all,
72 adenocarcinomas (ADs), 27 squamous cell carcinomas (SQCs), 13 pleomorphic
carcinomas (PLCs), 10 small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs), 5 large-cell
neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs), 5 adenosquamous carcinomas (ADSQCs), 3
large-cell carcinomas with basaloid features (B-LCC), 2 carcinoids, 2
carcinosarcomas (CS), 2 salivary-gland type tumors (SGTTs) of the lung, and 5
pleural malignant epithelioid mesotheliomas (MEMs) were prospectively diagnosed
by morphology and verified by immunohistochemistry for p40, p63, and thyroid
transcription factor 1 (TTF1). Histological scores (HS) were devised by
multiplying the percentage of immunoreactive cells (0 to 100%) by immunostaining 
intensity (low = 1 vs strong = 2, according to internal controls). There was a
nonrandom distribution of p40 across the diverse tumor groups and cell
differentiation lineages, with p40-HS > 100 closely paralleling squamous or
myoepithelial carcinomas (SQC, B-LCC, SQC-containing PLC, ADSQC with predominant 
SQC, SGTT), and p40-HS = 10 pinpointing AD, AD-containing PLC, or CS and
neuroendocrine (NE) tumors. At variance, p63-HS was significantly higher than p40
in AD (P < .0001) and NE tumors (P = .0156), with positive predictive value being
83% and 95% and overall accuracy being 95% and 99%, respectively. Also, TTF1 was 
shared by gland-differentiated and NE tumors. MEM cases were always negative for 
all biomarkers. The HS-guided assessment of p40 allowed an effective orientation 
among thoracic malignancies at the level of individual tumor patients thereby
contributing to prospectively realize a driver, holistic approach to cancer
characterization.

TP63 germ-line mutations are responsible for a group of human ectodermal
dysplasia syndromes, underlining the key role of P63 in the development of
ectoderm-derived tissues. Here, we report the identification of two TP63 alleles,
G134V (p.Gly173Val) and insR155 (p.Thr193_Tyr194insArg), associated to ADULT and 
EEC syndromes, respectively. These alleles, along with previously identified
G134D (p.Gly173Asp) and R204W (p.Arg243Trp), were functionally characterized in
yeast, studied in a mammalian cell line and modeled based on the crystal
structure of the P63 DNA-binding domain. Although the p.Arg243Trp mutant showed
both complete loss of transactivation function and ability to interfere over
wild-type P63, the impact of p.Gly173Asp, p.Gly173Val, and p.Thr193_Tyr194insArg 
varied depending on the response element (RE) tested. Interestingly, p.Gly173Asp 
and p.Gly173Val mutants were characterized by a severe defect in transactivation 
along with interfering ability on two DN-P63a-specific REs derived from genes
closely related to the clinical manifestations of the TP63-associated syndromes, 
namely PERP and COL18A1. The modeling of the mutations supported the distinct
functional effect of each mutant. The present results highlight the importance of
integrating different functional endpoints that take in account the features of
P63 proteins' target sequences to examine the impact of TP63 mutations and the
associated clinical variability.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a frequently fatal heterogeneous
disease. Beyond the role of human papilloma virus (HPV), no validated molecular
characterization of the disease has been established. Using an integrated genomic
analysis and validation methodology we confirm four molecular classes of HNSCC
(basal, mesenchymal, atypical, and classical) consistent with signatures
established for squamous carcinoma of the lung, including deregulation of the
KEAP1/NFE2L2 oxidative stress pathway, differential utilization of the lineage
markers SOX2 and TP63, and preference for the oncogenes PIK3CA and EGFR. For
potential clinical use the signatures are complimentary to classification by HPV 
infection status as well as the putative high risk marker CCND1 copy number gain.
A molecular etiology for the subtypes is suggested by statistically significant
chromosomal gains and losses and differential cell of origin expression patterns.
Model systems representative of each of the four subtypes are also presented.

MiR203 mediates subversion of stem cell properties during mammary epithelial
differentiation via repression of <U+0394>NP63a and promotes mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition.

During reproductive life, the mammary epithelium undergoes consecutive cycles of 
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Doing so relies on the retained
proliferative capacity, prolonged lifespan and developmental potency of mammary
stem cells (MaSCs). <U+0394>Np63a, the predominant TP63 isoform in mammary epithelia, is
robustly expressed in MaSCs and is required for preservation of self-renewing
capacity in diverse epithelial structures. However, the mechanism(s) underlying
subversion of this activity during forfeiture of self-renewing capacity are
poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) govern critical cellular functions
including stem cell maintenance, development, cell cycle regulation and
differentiation by disrupting translation of target mRNAs. Data presented here
indicate that expression of miR203, a miRNA that targets <U+0394>Np63a and <U+0394>Np63ß is
activated during luminal epithelial differentiation and that this pattern is
observed in the murine mammary hierarchy. In addition, we present evidence that
the transcription factor Zeb1 represses miR203 expression, thus enhancing <U+0394>Np63a 
protein levels. Furthermore, ectopic miR203 suppresses <U+0394>Np63a expression,
proliferation and colony formation. The anti-clonogenic effects mediated by
miR203 require suppression of <U+0394>Np63a. In addition, ectopic miR203 promotes
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and disrupts activities associated with
epithelial stem cells. These studies support a model in which induction of miR203
mediates forfeiture of self-renewing capacity via suppression of <U+0394>Np63a and may
also have anti-tumorigenic activity through its reduction of EMT and cancer stem 
cell populations.

The role of apoptosis in melanoma pathogenesis and chemoresistance is poorly
characterized. Mutations in TP53 occur infrequently, yet the TP53 apoptotic
pathway is often abrogated. This may result from alterations in TP53 family
members, including the TP53 homologue TP63. Here we demonstrate that TP63 has an 
antiapoptotic role in melanoma and is responsible for mediating chemoresistance. 
Although p63 was not expressed in primary melanocytes, up-regulation of p63 mRNA 
and protein was observed in melanoma cell lines and clinical samples, providing
the first evidence of significant p63 expression in this lineage. Upon genotoxic 
stress, endogenous p63 isoforms were stabilized in both nuclear and mitochondrial
subcellular compartments. Our data provide evidence of a physiological
interaction between p63 with p53 whereby translocation of p63 to the mitochondria
occurred through a codependent process with p53, whereas accumulation of p53 in
the nucleus was prevented by p63. Using RNA interference technology, both
isoforms of p63 (TA and <U+0394>Np63) were demonstrated to confer chemoresistance,
revealing a novel oncogenic role for p63 in melanoma cells. Furthermore,
expression of p63 in both primary and metastatic melanoma clinical samples
significantly correlated with melanoma-specific deaths in these patients.
Ultimately, these observations provide a possible explanation for abrogation of
the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway in melanoma, implicating novel approaches
aimed at sensitizing melanoma to therapeutic agents.

Histological subclassification of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has growing 
therapeutic impact. In advanced cancer stages tissue specimens are usually
bioptically collected. These small samples are of extraordinary value since
molecular analyses are gaining importance for targeted therapies. We therefore
studied the feasibility, diagnostic accuracy, economic and prognostic effects of 
a tissue sparing simultaneous multi-antibody assay for subclassification of
NSCLC. Of 265 NSCLC patients tissue multi arrays (TMA) were constructed to
simulate biopsy samples. TMAs were stained by a simultaneous bi-color
multi-antibody assay consisting of TTF1, Vimentin, p63 and neuroendocrine markers
(CD56, chromogranin A, synaptophysin). Classification was based mainly on the
current proposal of the IASLC with a hierarchical decision tree for
subclassification into adenocarcinoma (LAC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), large
cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and NSCLC not otherwise specified.
Investigation of tumor heterogeneity showed an explicit lower variation for
immunohistochemical analyses compared to conventional classification.
Furthermore, survival analysis of our combined immunohistochemical classification
revealed distinct separation of each entity's survival curve. This was
statistically significant for therapeutically important subgroups (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.045). As
morphological and molecular cancer testing is emerging, our multi-antibody assay 
in combination with standardized classification delivers accurate and reliable
separation of histomorphological diagnoses. Additionally, it permits clinically
relevant subtyping of NSCLC including LCNEC. Our multi-antibody assay may
therefore be of special value, especially in diagnosing small biopsies. It futher
delivers substantial prognostic information with therapeutic consequences.
Integration of immunohistochemical subtyping including investigation of
neuroendocrine differentiation into standard histopathological classification of 
NSCLC must, therefore, be considered.

Various combinations of limb anomalies, ectodermal dysplasias and orofacial
clefts characterize heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor gene p63. 
The causative gene is crucial during embryonic ontogenesis, mostly in the
development of limbs and other ectodermal derived tissues. The pattern of
mutations in six different p63-related syndromes (EEC syndrome, AEC syndrome,
ADULT syndrome, LMS syndrome, RHS syndrome, SHFM syndrome) shows
genotype-phenotype correlations. The most frequent p63 mutation syndrome is the
EEC syndrome, characterized by ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft
lip/palate. Ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by ectrodactyly often
associated with syndactyly, sparse hair, dry skin, hypo-anodontia, dysplastic
nails and alterations in sebaceous glands, mammary glands and nipples. The third 
hallmark of the EEC syndrome is orofacial clefting, in particular lip and palate.
p63 mutations also cause the other five inherited syndromes: symptoms are
overlapping, but each of these diseases has its own characteristic phenotypic
features: for instance AEC syndrome (ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft
lip/palate) has as distinctive feature ankyloblepharon, while mammary glands and 
nipples hypoplasia are frequent findings in LMS syndrome and in ADULT syndrome
(acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome). The latter can be distinguished
from other p63 syndromes by the absence of orofacial clefting and by prominent
ectodermal signs. The narrowest genotype-phenotype correlation is in the EEC and 
AEC syndromes. All EEC missense mutations are clustered in the DNA binding domain
and do not bind to DNA; in contrast, all missens mutations reported in AEC
syndrome are localized in the a-motif domain, and it has been demonstrated that
they disrupt interaction with other proteins. LMS and ADULT syndrome have their
own unique mutated amino-acid residues. Only two amino-acid residues are known to
be mutated amongst ADULT syndrome: asparagines 6 and arginine 298. Although R298 
is in the DNA binding domain, it is functionally different from the EEC
mutations, because its substitution by glutamine does not lead to a loss of DNA
binding, but to a gain of transactivation activity of the <U+2206>Np63<U+03B3> isoform. In this
paper we discuss the consistent phenotypic features associated with these gain of
function mutations.

All p53 family members are expressed in several isoforms through alternative
promoters and alternative splicing. However, the significance of these isoforms
is not yet well understood in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In this study, we
investigated the expression of p53, p63, p73 and their isoforms at the mRNA and
protein levels in CCA. The overexpression of <U+2206>133p53 was observed in the CCA cell
lines and clinical specimens. Moreover, the high expression of <U+2206>133p53/TAp53
correlated with short overall survival (p<0.001). Defective p53, including mutant
and <U+2206>Np53, was associated with poor prognosis (p<0.024). Multivariate analysis
demonstrated that <U+2206>133p53/TAp53 and mutant p53 protein may be used as independent
prognostic factors for CCA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use
of <U+2206>133p53/TAp53 as a potential biomarker in CCA.

PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of three culture media for growth,
proliferation, differentiation, and viability of ex vivo cultured limbal
epithelial progenitor cells.
METHODS: Limbal epithelial progenitor cell cultures were established from ten
human corneal rims and grew on plastic wells in three culture media: supplemental
hormonal epithelial medium (SHEM), keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM), and
Epilife. The performance of culturing limbal epithelial progenitor cells in each 
medium was evaluated according to the following parameters: growth area of
epithelial migration; immunocytochemistry for adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding
cassette member 2 (ABCG2), p63, Ki67, cytokeratin 3 (CK3), and vimentin (VMT) and
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for CK3,
ABCG2, and p63, and cell viability using Hoechst staining.
RESULTS: Limbal epithelial progenitor cells cultivated in SHEM showed a tendency 
to faster migration, compared to KSFM and Epilife. Immunocytochemical analysis
showed that proliferated cells in the SHEM had lower expression for markers
related to progenitor epithelial cells (ABCG2) and putative progenitor cells
(p63), and a higher percentage of positive cells for differentiated epithelium
(CK3) when compared to KSFM and Epilife. In PCR analysis, ABCG2 expression was
statistically higher for Epilife compared to SHEM. Expression of p63 was
statistically higher for Epilife compared to SHEM and KSFM. However, CK3
expression was statistically lower for KSFM compared to SHEM.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we concluded that cells cultured in KSFM and 
Epilife media presented a higher percentage of limbal epithelial progenitor
cells, compared to SHEM.

Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors are thought as breakthrough for 
cancer treatment in solid tumors such as breast cancer through their effects on
PARP's enzymatic activity. Our previous findings showed that the hydrophilic PARP
inhibitor PJ34 enhances the sensitivity of p53 proficient MCF7 breast carcinoma
cells to topotecan, a DNA Topoisomerase I (TOP 1) inhibitor. In the present
study, we combine the classical TOP 1 poison camptothecin or its water-soluble
derivative topotecan with PJ34 to investigate the potentiation of
chemotherapeutic efficiency in MCF7 (p53(WT)), MDA-MB231 (p53(mut)) breast
carcinoma cells and SCC022 (p53(null)) squamous carcinoma cells. We show that,
following TPT-PJ34 combined treatment, MCF7 cells exhibit apoptotic death while
MDA-MB231 and SCC022 cells are more resistant to these agents. Specifically, in
MCF7, (i) PJ34 in combination with TPT causes a G2/M cell cycle arrest followed
by massive apoptosis; (ii) PJ34 addition reverts TPT-dependent PARP-1
automodification and triggers caspase-dependent PARP-1 proteolysis; (iii) TPT,
used as a single agent, stimulates p53 expression while in combination with PJ34 
increases p53, TAp63a and TAp63<U+03B3> protein levels with a concomitant reduction of
MDM2 protein. The identification of p63 proteins as new players involved in the
cancer cell response to TPT-PJ34 is relevant for a better understanding of the
PARP1-dependent signaling of DNA damage. Furthermore, our data indicate that, in 
response to TPT-PJ34 combined chemotherapy, a functional cooperation between p53 
and TAp63 proteins may occur and be essential to trigger apoptotic cell death.

The WWOX tumor suppressor is a WW domain-containing protein. Its function in the 
cell has been shown to be mediated, in part, by interacting with its partners
through its first WW (WW1) domain. Here, we demonstrated that WWOX via WW1 domain
interacts with p53 homolog, <U+0394>Np63a. This protein-protein interaction stabilizes
<U+0394>Np63a, through antagonizing function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, inhibits
nuclear translocation of <U+0394>Np63a into the nucleus and suppresses <U+0394>Np63a
transactivation function. Additionally, we found that this functional crosstalk
reverses cancer cells resistance to cisplatin, mediated by <U+0394>Np63a, and
consequently renders these cells more sensitive to undergo apoptosis. These
findings suggest a functional crosstalk between WWOX and <U+0394>Np63a in tumorigenesis.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive and chemoradioresistant brain 
malignancy. Temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA-alkylating agent, is effective against GBM 
and has become the standard first-line drug. However, the mechanism by which TMZ 
regulates the progression of GBM remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that TMZ
targets TAp63, a p53 family member, inducing its expression to suppress the
progression of human GBM. High levels of TAp63 expression in GBM tissues after
TMZ treatment was an indicator of favourable prognosis. In human GBM cells,
TMZ-induced TAp63 directly repressed MYC transcription. Activation of this
TAp63-MYC pathway by TMZ inhibited human GBM progression both in vitro and in
vivo. Furthermore, downregulation of MYC mRNA levels in recurrent GBMs after TMZ 
treatment correlated with better patient survival. Therefore, our results suggest
that the TAp63-mediated transcriptional repression of MYC is a novel pathway
regulating TMZ efficacy in GBM.

Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of congenital syndromes affecting a variety of
ectodermal derivatives. Among them, ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft
lip/palate (EEC) syndrome is caused by single point mutations in the p63 gene,
which controls epidermal development and homeostasis. Phenotypic defects of the
EEC syndrome include skin defects and limbal stem-cell deficiency. In this study,
we designed a unique cellular model that recapitulated major embryonic defects
related to EEC. Fibroblasts from healthy donors and EEC patients carrying two
different point mutations in the DNA binding domain of p63 were reprogrammed into
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. EEC-iPSC from both patients showed
early ectodermal commitment into K18(+) cells but failed to further differentiate
into K14(+) cells (epidermis/limbus) or K3/K12(+) cells (corneal epithelium).
APR-246 (PRIMA-1(MET)), a small compound that restores functionality of mutant
p53 in human tumor cells, could revert corneal epithelial lineage commitment and 
reinstate a normal p63-related signaling pathway. This study illustrates the
relevance of iPSC for p63 related disorders and paves the way for future therapy 
of EEC.

mutated in cancer, whereas mutations in p63 cause developmental disorders
manifested in ectodermal dysplasia, limb defects, and orofacial clefting. We have
established primary adult skin keratinocytes from ectrodactyly, ectodermal
dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome patients with p63 mutations as an 
in vitro human model to study the disease mechanism in the skin of EEC patients. 
We show that these patient keratinocytes cultured either in submerged 2D cultures
or in 3D skin equivalents have impaired epidermal differentiation and
stratification. Treatment of these patient keratinocytes with the mutant
p53-targeting compound APR-246/PRIMA-1(MET) (p53 reactivation and induction of
massive apoptosis) that has been successfully tested in a phase I/II clinical
trial in cancer patients partially but consistently rescued morphological
features and gene expression during epidermal stratification in both 2D and 3D
models. This rescue coincides with restoration of p63 target-gene expression. Our
data show that EEC patient keratinocytes with p63 mutations can be used for
characterization of the abnormal molecular circuitry in patient skin and may open
possibilities for the design of novel pharmacological treatment strategies for
patients with mutant p63-associated developmental abnormalities.

Mixed pituitary adenoma/craniopharyngiomas are very rare tumors. Their
pathogenesis is still unclear and it is not known whether they are collision
tumors derived from independent stem cells or whether they originate from a
single stem cell undergoing divergent differentiation. The latter hypothesis is
supported by the close commixture between the two tumor components with
transition areas that has been previously described. However, "hybrid" cells with
both pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma features have never been described. 
In this paper we report a case of mixed pituitary adenoma/craniopharyngioma
observed in a 75-year-old woman presenting with diplopia and slight increase of
serum prolactin, who underwent endoscopic endonasal trans-sphenoidal tumor
resection. Histologically, the tumor was composed of a typical pituitary silent
subtype 2 ACTH cell adenoma admixed with islands of adamantinomatous
craniopharyngioma. Electron microscopy showed that, in addition to distinct
silent subtype 2 ACTH and craniopharyngioma cells, there were "hybrid" cells,
showing characteristics of both pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma,
consisting of small dense secretory granules, bundles of cytoplasmic filaments,
and desmosomes. This ultrastructural finding was also confirmed by the presence
of cells showing nuclear p40 expression and chromogranin A immunoreactivity. The 
close commixture between the two components and the ultrastructural and
immunohistochemical findings demonstrate a common histogenesis of the two
components and support the classification of the neoplasm as a mixed tumor. The
patient completely recovered and, 10 months after surgery, head MR confirmed the 
complete resection of the lesion.

The role of p63 in cancer has been an area of intense debate and controversy. Is 
TP63 (which encodes p63) a tumour suppressor gene or an oncogene? This debate is 
partly due to the complexity of the gene. There are several p63 isoforms - some
with tumour suppressive functions and others with oncogenic functions. In this
Opinion article, we focus on the recent advances in understanding p63 biology and
its roles in cancer. In this regard, we discuss the role of p63 in multiple stem 
cell compartments, ageing, in the response to DNA damage and in DNA repair.
Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding the interactions between
all three p53 family members and the potential impact of this knowledge on cancer
therapy and regenerative medicine.

Despite advances in detection and therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer
continues to be a major clinical problem. The aberrant activity of stem cell
pathways, and their regulation by the Androgen Receptor (AR), has the potential
to provide insight into novel mechanisms and pathways to prevent and treat
advanced, castrate-resistant prostate cancers. To this end, we investigated the
role of the embryonic stem cell regulator Sox2 [SRY (sex determining region
Y)-box 2] in normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. In the normal
prostate, Sox2 is expressed in a portion of basal epithelial cells. Prostate
tumors were either Sox2-positive or Sox2-negative, with the percentage of
Sox2-positive tumors increasing with Gleason Score and metastases. In the
castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1, endogenous expression of
Sox2 was repressed by AR signaling, and AR chromatin-IP shows that AR binds the
enhancer element within the Sox2 promoter. Likewise, in normal prostate
epithelial cells and human embryonic stem cells, increased AR signaling also
decreases Sox2 expression. Resistance to the anti-androgen MDV3100 results in a
marked increase in Sox2 expression within three prostate cancer cell lines, and
in the castration-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cell line ectopic expression
of Sox2 was sufficient to promote castration-resistant tumor formation. Loss of
Sox2 expression in the castration-resistant CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line
inhibited cell growth. Up-regulation of Sox2 was not associated with increased
CD133 expression but was associated with increased FGF5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor
5) expression. These data propose a model of elevated Sox2 expression due to loss
of AR-mediated repression during castration, and consequent castration-resistance
via mechanisms not involving induction of canonical embryonic stem cell pathways.

<U+0394>Np63a utilizes multiple mechanisms to repress transcription in squamous cell
carcinoma cells.

Developmental Biology, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA.

<U+0394>Np63a is a potent oncogene in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and a
pro-proliferative factor expressed by basal epithelial cells. <U+0394>Np63a functions
both as a transcriptional repressor and activator, but it is not clear how these 
activities contribute to its oncogenic potential. <U+0394>Np63a was proposed to function
as a dominant negative of the related factor p53. Additionally, <U+0394>Np63a was shown 
to inactivate its family member TAp73 and mediate recruitment of repressive
histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes to chromatin. Recently, we identified a new 
mechanism of repression involving recruitment of histone H2A/H2A.Z exchange
complexes and H2A.Z deposition at <U+0394>Np63a target genes. Here, we aimed to define
the possible co-occurrence of the various repressive mechanisms. In lung SCC
cells expressing <U+0394>Np63a, p53 and TAp73, we found that <U+0394>Np63a exerts its
pro-proliferative and transcriptional repressive effects in a manner independent 
of p53, TAp73 and histone H3 and H4 deacetylation. Instead, <U+0394>Np63a target genes
are differentiated from non-target genes within the p53 network by incorporation 
and accumulation of acetylated H2A.Z. These results indicate that <U+0394>Np63a utilizes
multiple mechanisms of repression in diverse epithelial and SCC cells.

PURPOSE: This study was aimed at analyzing the recurrence-related prognostic
significance of 12 candidate molecular biomarkers in node-negative stage I-II
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed promoter methylation of eight
genes using methylation-specific PCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
tissues from 328 node-negative stage I-II NSCLCs. The expression of Bcl-2,
E-cadherin, p53, and p63 proteins was also assessed by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Recurrence was found in 145 (44%) of 328 node-negative stage I-II NSCLCs
with a median follow-up period of 6.2 years. No association was found between
recurrence and alteration of individual biomarker in univariate analysis. We
defined recurrently divergent groups on the basis of recursive partitioning
analyses for 12 biomarkers and found a significant association of co-alteration
of RASSF1A and p63 with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Cox proportional
hazards analysis showed that hypermethylation of RASSF1A and negative expression 
of p63 was associated with poor RFS [HR, 1.93; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.13-5.47; P = 0.009] compared with those without co-alteration of RASSF1A and
p63, after adjusting for age, adjuvant therapy, histology, and tumor size. Random
forest classifier including RASSF1A and p63 showed best performance in the
prediction of recurrence in node-negative stage I-II NSCLCs: area under receiver 
operator characteristic curve for random forest was 0.91 and error rate for the
model was 17%.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that RASSF1A and p63 may be independent
prognostic indicators for RFS in node-negative stage I-II NSCLCs.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship among the
protein levels of MCM7, p63, and human papillomavirus (HPV) in different cervical
lesion tissues and appraise their predictive value in evaluating severity of
cervical disease.
METHODS: Twelve normal cervix or chronic cervicitis, 42 squamous intraepithelial 
lesions, and 53 cervical carcinoma tissues were enrolled, and the protein levels 
of MCM7, p63, and HPV were detected by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The positive examination rates of all the MCM7, p63, and HPV proteins
increased gradually and significantly from normal cervix and chronic cervicitis
tissues, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions to cervical carcinomas, respectively. As to predict
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and carcinogenesis is concerned, the 
MCM7 protein had a sensitivity of 94.0%, a specificity of 56.5%, a positive
predictive value of 88.8%, and a negative predictive value of 72.2%. The p63
protein had a sensitivity of 78.6%, a specificity of 81.8%, a positive predictive
value of 94.3%, and a negative predictive value of 50.0%. Protein level of MCM7
was positively correlated with that of p63 in cervical tissues (r = 0.806, P <
0.01), and the p63 was also positively correlated with histopathologic type (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Protein levels of MCM7 and p63 were associated significantly with
high-grade cervical lesion, and aberrant p63 protein level may distinguish
different histopathologic types of cervical carcinoma. They may act as
co-predictive index in both HPV-dependent and HPV-independent high-grade cervical
lesion with high sensitivity and specificity.

The p63 gene, a member of the p53 gene family, has two different promoter
usage-generating proteins that contain or lack (<U+0394>N) an NH2-terminus. Although p53
and p63 have high sequence and structural similarities, the molecules differ in
function and expression profiles. p63 is critical for the development of
epithelial organs or tissues, including the epidermis and other squamous
epithelia, as well as the salivary, lachrymal, mammary and prostate glands and
the urothelium. In addition, p63 is essential for the proliferative potential of 
stem cells in the epidermis. In contrast to p53, the role of <U+0394>Np63 in tumors
remains unclear and complex. Our previous study demonstrated that <U+0394>Np63 is
overexpressed in human bladder carcinoma tissues. The mechanism by which <U+0394>Np63
promotes tumor cell development, including adhesion, proliferation and polarity, 
is unknown. Data demonstrate that <U+0394>Np63 induces the invasiveness of cancer cells 
through specific downstream genes and the mechanism is associated with cell
junctions. Claudin-1 is an important p63 target gene for normal skin development.
Claudin-1, as a connexin, functions in a similar manner to other connexins to
affect important events during cancer cell development. In the present study,
<U+0394>Np63 gene expression in bladder tumor tissues was found to be significantly
higher than that in normal tissue, indicating that <U+0394>Np63 is localized to the
nucleus. In addition, <U+0394>Np63 silencing decreased invasion and metastasis in
UM-UC-3 cells and reduced claudin-1 expression.

INTRODUCTION: The histological subtyping of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is
important in the selection of the optimal treatment for patients with advanced
disease. There are now important differences in the chemotherapy regimens used
for squamous and non-squamous cancers. Non-squamous cancers (particularly
adenocarcinomas) are also suitable for targeted therapy if the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) genetic mutation is present. Diagnosis is frequently made 
by fine needle aspiration from lymph node metastases. We have evaluated the
adequacy of material obtained by EBUS-TBNA for subtyping of NSCLC.
METHODS: All EBUS-TBNA procedures performed at Leeds Teaching Hospitals between
February 2009 and November 2011 were analysed. Data was collected on the
indication, final cytological diagnosis and whether EGFR mutation testing was
possible. We analysed the data to establish our rate of NSCLC-NOS diagnoses and
to determine the technical success of EGFR testing.
RESULTS: Data from 391 procedures was analysed. The indication was staging of
malignancy in 345 patients and suspected non-malignant disease in 48 patients.
Malignant disease was diagnosed in 204 patients (53.7%), small cell 43, squamous 
cell 64, adenocarcinoma 40, adenosquamous 2, large cell 12, NSCLC-NOS 31 and
malignant disease of non-lung primary 12. EBUS-TBNA identified 149 patients with 
NCSLC. Subtyping could be obtained in 118 (79.2%). The number of patients with a 
diagnosis of NSCLC NOS on EBUS-TBNA was 31 (20.8%, 95% CI 15-28%). Of the 204
specimens with a malignant diagnosis immunohistochemistry was performed in 149
(73.0%). It was not performed in 52 (25.5%) cases and there was insufficient
material available in 3 (1.5%) cases. EGFR testing was requested in 36 patients. 
Our test success rate for EGFR mutation testing on EBUS-TBNA samples was 88.8%
(95%CI 74.7-95.6%).
CONCLUSION: EBUS-TBNA samples when made into cell blocks and subjected to a panel
of immunohistochemical stains returned adequate tissue for cytological analysis
in over 97% of cases, with an NOS rate of 20.8%. We have also shown that cytology
specimens are adequate for EGFR mutation testing in over 88% of cases. We
conclude that EBUS-TBNA is an accurate diagnostic test both for determining NSCLC
subtype and performing EGFR mutation analysis to tailor treatment in lung cancer 
patients.

Bladder exstrophy epispadias complex (BEEC) is a severe congenital anomaly;
however, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of BEEC
remain unclear. TP63, a member of TP53 tumor suppressor gene family, is expressed
in bladder urothelium and skin over the external genitalia during mammalian
development. It plays a role in bladder development. We have previously shown
that p63(-/-) mouse embryos developed a bladder exstrophy phenotype identical to 
human BEEC. We hypothesised that TP63 is involved in human BEEC pathogenesis. RNA
was extracted from BEEC foreskin specimens and, as in mice, <U+0394>Np63 was the
predominant p63 isoform. <U+0394>Np63 expression in the foreskin and bladder epithelium 
of BEEC patients was reduced. DNA was sequenced from 163 BEEC patients and 285
ethnicity-matched controls. No exon mutations were detected. Sequencing of the
<U+0394>Np63 promoter showed 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 4 insertion/deletion 
(indel) polymorphisms. Indel polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk
of BEEC. Significantly the sites of indel polymorphisms differed between
Caucasian and non-Caucasian populations. A 12-base-pair deletion was associated
with an increased risk with only Caucasian patients (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0052 Odds Ratio
(OR)<U+200A>=<U+200A>18.33), whereas a 4-base-pair insertion was only associated with
non-Caucasian patients (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0259 OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.583). We found a consistent and
statistically significant reduction in transcriptional efficiencies of the
promoter sequences containing indel polymorphisms in luciferase assays. These
findings suggest that indel polymorphisms of the <U+0394>Np63 promoter lead to a
reduction in p63 expression, which could lead to BEEC.

Gawrych E, Binczak-Kuleta A, Janiszewska-Olszowska J, Ciechanowicz A.

Ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft syndrome (EEC) results from a
simultaneous developmental abnor-caused by mutations of the tp63 gene. Five
mutations: 204, 227, 279, 280, and 304 account for most cases of this syndrome. A
case with R304W mutation, characterized by the presence of all major
(ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip and palate) and two minor
(lacrimal duct obstruction, developmental delay) clinical symptoms of the
syndrome is presented. This severe case improves the existing knowledge
concerning the genotype-phenotype correlations in EEC syndrome.

Transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, shares a high degree of
sequence similarity with p53. Because of transcription from two distinct
promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63. Although TAp63
acts as a tumor suppressor, <U+0394>Np63 functions as an oncogene and is often
overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting
<U+0394>Np63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress <U+0394>Np63. Here we found that
arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits
<U+0394>Np63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, 
we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of <U+0394>Np63 protein via a
proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of <U+0394>Np63
transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2
promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we
found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2
enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of <U+0394>Np63 protein. Importantly, we found
that knockdown of <U+0394>Np63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of <U+0394>Np63 inhibits,
growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic 
degrades <U+0394>Np63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that 
inhibition of <U+0394>Np63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.

In the past fifteen years, it has become apparent that tumour-associated p53
mutations can provoke activities that are different to those resulting from
simply loss of wild-type tumour-suppressing p53 function. Many of these mutant
p53 proteins acquire oncogenic properties that enable them to promote invasion,
metastasis, proliferation and cell survival. Here we highlight some of the
emerging molecular mechanisms through which mutant p53 proteins can exert these
oncogenic functions.

Estrogen receptor a (ERa) is present in about 70 % of human breast cancers and,
working in conjunction with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), this 
nuclear hormone receptor regulates the expression of many protein-encoding genes.
Given the crucial roles of miRNAs in cancer biology, we investigated the
regulation of miRNAs by estradiol (E2) through ERa and ERK2, and their impact on 
target gene expression and phenotypic properties of breast cancer cells. We
identified miRNA-encoding genes harboring overlapping ERa and ERK chromatin
binding sites in ERa-positive MCF-7 cells and showed ERa and ERK2 to bind to
these sites and to be required for transcriptional induction of these miRNAs by
E2. Hsa-miR-196a2*, the most highly estrogen up-regulated miRNA, markedly
down-regulated tumor protein p63 (TP63), a member of the p53 family. In
ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast cancer cells, proliferative and invasiveness
properties were suppressed by hsa-miR-196a2* expression and enhanced by
hsa-miR-196a2* antagonism or TP63 target protector oligonucleotides.
Hsa-miR-196a2* and TP63 were inversely correlated in breast cancer cell lines and
in a large cohort of human breast tumors, implying clinical relevance. The
findings reveal a tumor suppressive role of hsa-miR-196a2* through regulation of 
TP63 by ERa and/or ERK2 signaling. Manipulating the hsa-miR-196a2*-TP63 axis
might provide a potential tumor-suppressive strategy to alleviate the aggressive

Reduced expression of the p53 family member p63 has been suggested to play a
causative role in cancer metastasis. Here, we show that <U+0394>Np63a, the predominant
p63 isoform, plays a major role in regulation of cell migration, invasion and
cancer metastasis. We identified mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
phosphatase 3 (MKP3) as a downstream target of <U+0394>Np63a that is required for
mediating these effects. We show that <U+0394>Np63a regulates extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) activity via MKP3 in both
cancer and non-transformed cells. We further show that exogenous <U+0394>Np63a inhibits 
cell invasion and is dependent on MKP3 upregulation for repression. Conversely,
endogenous pan-p63 ablation results in increased cell migration and invasion,
which can be reverted by reintroducing the <U+0394>Np63a isoform alone, but not by other
isoforms. Interestingly, these effects require Erk2, but not Erk1 expression, and
can be rescued by enforced MKP3 expression. Moreover, MKP3 expression is reduced 
in invasive cancers, and reduced p63 expression increases metastatic frequency in
vivo. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for <U+0394>Np63a in
preventing cancer metastasis by inhibition of Erk2 signaling via MKP3.

How cells choose between developmental pathways remains a fundamental biological 
question. In the case of the p53 protein family, its three transcription factors 
(p73, p63, and p53) each trigger a gene expression pattern that leads to specific
cellular pathways. At the same time, these transcription factors recognize the
same response element (RE) consensus sequences, and their transactivation of
target genes overlaps. We aimed to understand target gene selectivity at the
molecular level by determining the crystal structures of the p73 DNA-binding
domain (DBD) in complex with full-site REs that vary in sequence. We report two
structures of the p73 DBD bound as a tetramer to 20-bp full-site REs based on two
distinct quarter-sites: GAACA and GAACC. Our study confirms that the DNA-binding 
residues are conserved within the p53 family, whereas the dimerization and
tetramerization interfaces diverge. Moreover, a conserved lysine residue in loop 
L1 of the DBD senses the presence of guanines in positions 2 and 3 of the
quarter-site RE, whereas a conserved arginine in loop 3 adapts to changes in
position 5. Sequence variations in the RE elicit a p73 conformational response
that might explain target gene specificity.

Genetic analysis of TP63 indicates that <U+0394>Np63 isoforms are required for
preservation of regenerative stasis within diverse epithelial tissues. In
squamous carcinomas, TP63 is commonly amplified, and <U+0394>Np63a confers a potent
survival advantage. Genome-wide occupancy studies show that <U+0394>Np63 promotes
bidirectional target gene regulation by binding more than 5,000 sites throughout 
the genome; however, the subset of targets mediating discreet activities of TP63 
remains unclear. We report that <U+0394>Np63a activates bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) 
signaling by inducing the expression of BMP7. Immunohistochemical analysis
indicates that hyperactivation of BMP signaling is common in human breast
cancers, most notably in the basal molecular subtype, as well as in several mouse
models of breast cancer. Suppression of BMP signaling in vitro with LDN193189, a 
small-molecule inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, represses clonogenicity 
and diminishes the cancer stem cell-enriched ALDH1(+) population. Importantly,
LDN193189 blocks reconstitution of mixed ALDH1(+)/ALDH1(-) cultures indicating
that BMP signaling may govern aspects of cellular plasticity within tumor
hierarchies. These results show that BMP signaling enables reversion of committed
populations to a stem-like state, potentially supporting progression and
maintenance of tumorigenesis. Treatment of a mouse model of breast cancer with
LDN193189 caused reduced expression of markers associated with
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, in vivo limiting
dilution analysis assays revealed that LDN193189 treatment suppressed
tumor-initiating capacity and increased tumor latency. These studies support a
model in which <U+0394>Np63a-mediated activation of BMP signaling governs epithelial
cell plasticity, EMT, and tumorigenicity during breast cancer initiation and
progression.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological process that plays
important roles in tumor metastasis, "stemness," and drug resistance. EMT is
typically characterized by the loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and
increased expression of EMT-associated transcriptional repressors, including ZEB1
and ZEB2. The miR-200 family and miR-205 prevent EMT through suppression of
ZEB1/2. p53 has been implicated in the regulation of miR-200c, but the mechanisms
controlling miR-205 expression remain elusive. Here we report that the p53 family
member and p63 isoform, <U+0394>Np63a, promotes miR-205 transcription and controls EMT
in human bladder cancer cells. <U+0394>Np63a, E-cadherin and miR-205 were coexpressed in
a panel of bladder cancer cell lines (n = 28) and a cohort of primary bladder
tumors (n = 98). Stable knockdown of <U+0394>Np63a in the "epithelial" bladder cancer
cell line UM-UC6 decreased the expression of miR-205 and induced the expression
of ZEB1/2, effects that were reversed by expression of exogenous miR-205.
Conversely, overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a in the "mesenchymal" bladder cancer cell
line UM-UC3 induced miR-205 and suppressed ZEB1/2. <U+0394>Np63a knockdown reduced the
expression of the primary and mature forms of miR-205 and the miR-205 "host" gene
(miR-205HG) and decreased binding of RNA Pol II to the miR-205HG promoter,
inhibiting miR-205HG transcription. Finally, high miR-205 expression was
associated with adverse clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients. Together,
our data demonstrate that <U+0394>Np63a-mediated expression of miR-205 contributes to
the regulation of EMT in bladder cancer cells and identify miR-205 as a molecular
marker of the lethal subset of human bladder cancers.

BACKGROUND: PERP is a p53/p63-regulated gene encoding a desmosomal protein that
plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion and tumor suppression.
STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated PERP expression in different grades of oral dysplasia 
(34 cases) and at different stages of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and
correlated the latter with clinical outcome. A tissue microarray consisting of
nondysplastic mucosa, carcinoma in situ, SCC, and nodal metastases from 33
patients with human papilloma virus-negative SCC was stained for PERP and
E-cadherin.
RESULTS: Complete loss of PERP expression was associated with worse local control
in patients with SCC. The 5-year local control rate was 91% for patients with
partial PERP loss versus 31% for those with complete loss (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that loss of PERP expression
correlates with the transition to SCC and with increased local relapse in
patients with oral cavity SCC.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of p63 protein
in mucoepidermoid carcinoma and papillary cystadenoma of the salivary glands, and
to evaluate the usefulness of this protein in distinguishing these tumors.
STUDY DESIGN: Immunoexpression of p63 protein was studied and quantified in 9
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mucous retention cysts, 4 papillary
cystadenomas, and 19 low-grade and 9 high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas.
RESULTS: All cases were positive for p63 immunoexpression; however, it was
observed that p63 labeling in mucous retention cysts and papillary cystadenomas
was limited to the basal layers of the cystic spaces, whereas in low-grade
mucoepidermoid carcinomas, positive nuclear staining was also found diffusely in 
the suprabasal layers. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma presented increased
immunoexpression of p63 compared with the other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: P63 immunohistochemical expression pattern can be helpful in
distinguishing low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma from papillary cystadenoma of
the salivary glands.

The aim of this study was to assess the immunohistochemical expression of p63
protein, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Notch-1 in the epithelial
lining of radicular cysts (RC), dentigerous cysts (DC) and keratocystic
odontogenic tumors (KOT). For this study, 35 RC, 22 DC and 17 KOT were used. The 
clinical and epidemiological data were collected from the patient charts filed in
the Oral Pathology Laboratory, University of Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.
Immunohistochemical reactions against the p63, EGFR and Notch-1 were performed in
3-µm-thick histological sections. The slides were evaluated according to the
following criteria: negative: <5% of positive cells, low expression: 5-50% of
positive cells, and high expression: >50% of positive cells. Moreover, the
intensity of EGFR and Notch-1 expressions was also evaluated. Fisher's exact test
and Spearman's correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis,
considering a significance level of 5%. Almost all cases demonstrated p63, EGFR
and Notch-1 expressions. The p63 expression was significantly higher in KOT
(p<0.001). Positive correlation between these immunomarkers was observed. These
findings suggest the participation of p63, EGFR and Notch-1 in the development,
maintenance and integrity of cystic odontogenic epithelial lining, favoring
lesion persistence. The high expression of p63 in KOT suggests that it may be
related to their more aggressive biological behavior and marked tendency to
recurrence.

The combination of irradiated fibroblast feeder cells and Rho kinase inhibitor,
Y-27632, conditionally induces an indefinite proliferative state in primary
mammalian epithelial cells. These conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) are
karyotype-stable and nontumorigenic. Because self-renewal is a recognized
property of stem cells, we investigated whether Y-27632 and feeder cells induced 
a stem-like phenotype. We found that CRCs share characteristics of adult stem
cells and exhibit up-regulated expression of a6 and ß1 integrins, <U+0394>Np63a, CD44,
and telomerase reverse transcriptase, as well as decreased Notch signaling and an
increased level of nuclear ß-catenin. The induction of CRCs is rapid (occurs
within 2 d) and results from reprogramming of the entire cell population rather
than the selection of a minor subpopulation. CRCs do not overexpress the
transcription factor sets characteristic of embryonic or induced pluripotent stem
cells (e.g., Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4). The induction of CRCs is also
reversible, and removal of Y-27632 and feeders allows the cells to differentiate 
normally. Thus, when CRCs from ectocervical epithelium or tracheal epithelium are
placed in an air-liquid interface culture system, the cervical cells form a well 
differentiated stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the tracheal cells form a 
ciliated airway epithelium. We discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic
opportunities afforded by a method that can generate adult stem-like cells in
vitro without genetic manipulation.

Phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a via a novel TGFß/ALK5 signaling mechanism mediates the

Genetic analysis of TP63 implicates <U+0394>Np63 isoforms in preservation of replicative
capacity and cellular lifespan within adult stem cells. <U+0394>Np63a is also an
oncogene and survival factor that mediates therapeutic resistance in squamous
carcinomas. These diverse activities are the result of genetic and functional
interactions between TP63 and an array of morphogenic and morphostatic signals
that govern tissue and tumor stasis, mitotic polarity, and cell fate; however the
cellular signals that account for specific functions of TP63 are incompletely
understood. To address this we sought to identify signaling pathways that
regulate expression, stability or activity of <U+0394>Np63a. An siRNA-based screen of
the human kinome identified the Type 1 TGFß receptor, ALK5, as the kinase
required for phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a at Serine 66/68 (S66/68). This activity is
TGFß-dependent and sensitive to either ALK5-directed siRNA or the ALK5 kinase
inhibitor A83-01. Mechanistic studies support a model in which ALK5 is
proteolytically cleaved at the internal juxtamembrane region resulting in the
translocation of the C-terminal ALK5-intracellular kinase domain (ALK5(IKD)). In 
this study, we demonstrate that ALK5-mediated phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a is
required for the anti-clonogenic effects of TGF<U+0392> and ectopic expression of
ALK5(IKD) mimics these effects. Finally, we present evidence that ultraviolet
irradiation-mediated phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a is sensitive to ALK5 inhibitors.
These findings identify a non-canonical TGFß-signaling pathway that mediates the 
anti-clonogenic effects of TGFß and the effects of cellular stress via <U+0394>Np63a
phosphorylation.

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been an invaluable model organism
for studying the molecular mechanisms that govern cell fate, from fundamental
aspects of multicellular development to programmed cell death (apoptosis). The
transparency of this organism permits visualization of cells in living animals at
high resolution. The powerful genetics and functional genomics tools available in
C. elegans allow for detailed analysis of gene function, including genes that are
frequently deregulated in human diseases such as cancer. The TP53 protein is a
critical suppressor of tumor formation in vertebrates, and the TP53 gene is
mutated in over 50% of human cancers. TP53 suppresses malignancy by integrating a
variety of cellular stresses that direct it to activate transcription of genes
that help to repair the damage or trigger apoptotic death if the damage is beyond
repair. The TP53 paralogs, TP63 and TP73, have distinct roles in development as
well as overlapping functions with TP53 in apoptosis and repair, which
complicates their analysis in vertebrates. C. elegans contains a single TP53
family member, cep-1, that shares properties of all three vertebrate genes and
thus offers a simple system in which to study the biological functions of this
important gene family. This review summarizes major advances in our understanding
of the TP53 family using C. elegans as a model organism.

p63 is a transcriptional factor implicated in cancer and development. The
presence in TP63 gene of alternative promoters allows expression of one isoform
containing the N-terminal transactivation domain (TA isoform) and one N-terminal 
truncated isoform (<U+0394>N isoform). Complete ablation of all p63 isoforms produced
mice with fatal developmental abnormalities, including lack of epidermal barrier,
limbs and other epidermal appendages. Specific TAp63-null mice, although they
developed normally, failed to undergo in DNA damage-induced apoptosis during
primordial follicle meiotic arrest, suggesting a p63 involvement in maternal
reproduction. Recent findings have elucidated the role in DNA damage response of 
a novel Hominidae p63 isoform, GTAp63, specifically expressed in human spermatic 
precursors. Thus, these findings suggest a unique strategy of p63 gene, to evolve
in order to preserve the species as a guardian of reproduction. Elucidation of
the biological basis of p63 function in reproduction may provide novel approaches
to the control of human fertility.

Most proteins have not evolved for maximal thermal stability. Some are only
marginally stable, as for example, the DNA-binding domains of p53 and its
homologs, whose kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities are strongly correlated.
Here, we applied high-throughput methods using a real-time PCR thermocycler to
study the stability of several full-length orthologs and paralogs of the p53
family of transcription factors, which have diverse functions, ranging from
tumour suppression to control of developmental processes. From isothermal
denaturation fluorimetry and differential scanning fluorimetry, we found that
full-length proteins showed the same correlation between kinetic and
thermodynamic stability as their isolated DNA-binding domains. The stabilities of
the full-length p53 orthologs were marginal and correlated with the temperature
of their organism, paralleling the stability of the isolated DNA-binding domains.
Additionally, the paralogs p63 and p73 were significantly more stable and
long-lived than p53. The short half-life of p53 orthologs and the greater
persistence of the paralogs may be biologically relevant.

AIM: To determine the degree of variation in the handling of prostate needle
biopsies (PBNx) in laboratories across Europe.
METHODS: A web based survey was emailed to members of the European Network of
Uropathology and the British Association of Urological Pathologists.
RESULTS: Responses were received from 241 laboratories in 15 countries. PNBx were
generally taken by urologists (93.8%) or radiologists (23.7%) but in 8.7% were
also taken by non-medical personnel such as radiographers, nurses or biomedical
assistants. Of the responding laboratories, 40.8% received cores in separate
containers, 42.3% processed one core/block, 54.2% examined three levels/block,
49.4% examined one H&E section/level and 56.1% retained spare sections for
potential immunohistochemistry. Of the laboratories, 40.9% retained unstained
spares for over a year while 36.2% discarded spares within 1 month of reporting. 
Only two (0.8%) respondents routinely performed immunohistochemistry on all PNBx.
There were differences in laboratory practice between the UK and the rest of
Europe (RE). Procurement of PNBx by non-medical personnel was more common in the 
UK. RE laboratories more commonly received each core in a separate container,
processed one core/block, examined fewer levels/block and examined more H&E
sections/level. RE laboratories also retained spares for potential
immunohistochemistry less often and for shorter periods. Use of p63 as the sole
basal cell marker was more common in RE.
CONCLUSIONS: There are marked differences in procurement, handling and processing
of PNBx in laboratories across Europe. This data can help the development of best
practice guidelines.

A micropapillary variant of prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma has not been reported
in the literature. Herein, we report a case of a 50-year-old patient who
presented with an elevated prostate-specific antigen concentration and was
subsequently diagnosed with prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Radical
prostatectomy specimen revealed prostatic carcinoma with Gleason score 4 + 5 <U+200A>=<U+200A> 
9/10, with micropapillary component constituting 80% of tumor volume.
Immunohistochemical studies of the prostate carcinoma showed a homogeneously
positive prostate-specific antigen and a-methylacyl-CoA racemase,
high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, and p63 protein cocktail pattern of staining
in both micropapillary and conventional components. Pelvic lymph nodes were
negative for metastatic disease. In contrast to the aggressive behavior of
micropapillary carcinomas of other organs, the disease in our patient has thus
far followed a more benign course, with low stage on presentation and a 2-year
follow-up free of disease. However, prognostic correlation should be established 
on large series in order to assign this variant to a grade category within the

Epidermal human keratinocytes are exposed to a wide range of environmental
genotoxic insults, including the UV component of solar radiation. Epidermal
homeostasis in response to cellular or tissue damage is maintained by a
population of keratinocyte stem cells (KSC) that reside in the basal layer of the
epithelium. Using cell sorting based on cell-surface markers, we have identified 
a novel a6 integrin(high+)/CD44(+) sub-population of basal keratinocytes. These
a6 integrin(high+)/CD44(+) keratinocytes have both high proliferative potential, 
form colonies in culture that have characteristics of holoclones and have a
unique pattern of resistance to apoptosis induced by UVB radiation or by agents
that induce single- or double strand DNA breaks. Resistance to UVB induced
apoptosis in the a6 integrin(high+)/CD44(+) cells involved increased expression
of TAp63 and was overcome by PI-3 kinase inhibition. In marked contrast, the a6
integrin(high+)/CD44(+) cells were sensitive to apoptosis induced by the
cross-linking agent cisplatin, and imatinib inhibition of c-Abl blocked the
ability of cisplatin to kill a6 integrin(high+)/CD44(+) cells. Our findings
reveal a population of basal keratinocytes with long-term proliferative
properties that display specific patterns of apoptotic resistance that is
dependent upon the genotoxic stimulus, and provide insights into how these cells 
can be targeted with chemotherapeutic agents.

The effects of disease mutations on protein structure and function have been
extensively investigated, and many predictors of the functional impact of single 
amino acid substitutions are publicly available. The majority of these predictors
are based on protein structure and evolutionary conservation, following the
assumption that disease mutations predominantly affect folded and conserved
protein regions. However, the prevalence of the intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) and regions (IDRs) in the human proteome together with their lack of fixed
structure and low sequence conservation raise a question about the impact of
disease mutations in IDRs. Here, we investigate annotated missense disease
mutations and show that 21.7% of them are located within such intrinsically
disordered regions. We further demonstrate that 20% of disease mutations in IDRs 
cause local disorder-to-order transitions, which represents a 1.7-2.7 fold
increase compared to annotated polymorphisms and neutral evolutionary
substitutions, respectively. Secondary structure predictions show elevated rates 
of transition from helices and strands into loops and vice versa in the disease
mutations dataset. Disease disorder-to-order mutations also influence predicted
molecular recognition features (MoRFs) more often than the control mutations. The
repertoire of disorder-to-order transition mutations is limited, with five most
frequent mutations (R<U+2192>W, R<U+2192>C, E<U+2192>K, R<U+2192>H, R<U+2192>Q) collectively accounting for 44% of
all deleterious disorder-to-order transitions. As a proof of concept, we
performed accelerated molecular dynamics simulations on a deleterious
disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63 and, in agreement with
our predictions, observed an increased a-helical propensity of the region
harboring the mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of mutations in
IDRs and refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations. The 
results of this study offer a new perspective on the role of mutations in
disease, with implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of
missense mutations.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a common malignant epithelial tumor of salivary
glands, but relatively rare in lung. The histological features of mucoepidermoid 
carcinoma of the lung are similar to its counterpart arising from the salivary
glands. Here, we reported a special tumor that occurred in the medial segment of 
the right lower lobe in a 22-year-old man. This tumor exhibited typical features 
of mucoepidermoid carcinoma with 3 cell types: squamoid cells, mucin-secreting
cells and cells of intermediate type. These 3 types of cells organized into
cysts, nests, glands and solid patterns. Specially, the inner lining cells of
some glandular structures were uniform cuboidal and hobnail-like, similar to the 
alveolar epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the inner 
lining cells of glandular structures were positive for thyroid transcription
factor-1 and surfactant protein-B, used as markers of alveolar epithelial cells, 
and were negative for p63. These findings for the first time demonstrated a rare 
alveolar epithelial differentiation of glandular inner lining cells in a
mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung.VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for

The emergence of the targeted therapies for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
has generated a need for accurate histologic subtyping of NSCLC. In this study,
we assessed the utility of immunohistochemical markers that could be helpful in
distinction between adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We
performed a battery of immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray for napsin-A,
Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), p63, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, thrombomodulin
(CD141), Epithelial-related antigen (MOC-31), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),
Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), high-molecular-weight CK (HMWCK), p27kip1 (p27), and Rb
protein in 129 resected primary NSCLC with 81 ADCs and 48 SCCs and 10 metastatic 
ADC to the lung (primary in colon, 7 cases; stomach, 2 cases; vagina, 1 case).
Cases of ADC and SCC were morphologically unequivocal and solid tumors with no
definite squamous or glandular differentiation were excluded for this analysis.
Napsin-A and TTF-1 were positive in 81% and 70% of ADC and in 0% and 2% of SCC,
respectively, whereas P63 and CK5/6 were positive in 91% and 90% of SCC and in 9%
and 4% of ADC, respectively (P < .001). CD141 stained significantly higher in SCC
over ADC (positive in 2% of ADC and 46% of SCC. MOC-31, CEA, COX-2, HMWCK, p27,
and Rb appeared to be not useful markers in distinction between ADC and SCC
because of their low specificity. None of metastatic ADC to the lung showed
positive for napsin-A and TTF-1. It was evident that combination of napsin-A,
TTF-1, CK5/6, and p63 was the best immunohistochemical panel in differentiating
ADC from SCC of the lung in this study. CD141 appeared to be a potential new
marker for SCC with high specificity. Cyclooxygenase 2, MOC-31, CEA, HMWCK, p27, 
and Rb showed less specificity for differentiation ADC from SCC.

The p63 protein plays a key role in regulating human keratinocyte proliferation
and differentiation. Although some p63-regulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
identified in the control of epidermal homeostasis, little is known about miRNAs 
acting downstream of p63. In this paper, we characterized multiple p63-regulated 
miRNAs (miR-17, miR-20b, miR-30a, miR-106a, miR-143 and miR-455-3p) and
elucidated their roles in the onset of keratinocyte differentiation. We
identified RB, p21 and multiple MAPKs as targets of these p63-controlled miRNAs. 
Upon inhibition of most of these miRNAs, we observed defects in commitment to
differentiation that could be reversed by siRNA-mediated silencing of their
targets. Furthermore, knockdown of MAPK8 and MAPK9 efficiently restored
expression of the early differentiation markers keratin 1 and keratin 10 in
p63-silenced primary human keratinocytes. These results highlight new mechanistic
roles of multiple miRNAs, particularly the miR-17 family (miR-17, miR-20b and
miR-106a), as regulatory intermediates for coordinating p63 with MAPK signaling
in the commitment of human mature keratinocytes to early differentiation.

Inter-individual variation in facial shape is one of the most noticeable
phenotypes in humans, and it is clearly under genetic regulation; however, almost
nothing is known about the genetic basis of normal human facial morphology. We
therefore conducted a genome-wide association study for facial shape phenotypes
in multiple discovery and replication cohorts, considering almost ten thousand
individuals of European descent from several countries. Phenotyping of facial
shape features was based on landmark data obtained from three-dimensional head
magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and two-dimensional portrait images. We
identified five independent genetic loci associated with different facial
phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of five candidate genes--PRDM16, PAX3,
TP63, C5orf50, and COL17A1--in the determination of the human face. Three of them
have been implicated previously in vertebrate craniofacial development and
disease, and the remaining two genes potentially represent novel players in the
molecular networks governing facial development. Our finding at PAX3 influencing 
the position of the nasion replicates a recent GWAS of facial features. In
addition to the reported GWA findings, we established links between common DNA
variants previously associated with NSCL/P at 2p21, 8q24, 13q31, and 17q22 and
normal facial-shape variations based on a candidate gene approach. Overall our
study implies that DNA variants in genes essential for craniofacial development
contribute with relatively small effect size to the spectrum of normal variation 
in human facial morphology. This observation has important consequences for
future studies aiming to identify more genes involved in the human facial
morphology, as well as for potential applications of DNA prediction of facial
shape such as in future forensic applications.

<U+0394>Np63a is a member of the p53 family of transcription factors that functions as
an oncogene in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Because <U+0394>Np63a and p53 bind
virtually identical DNA sequence motifs, it has been proposed that <U+0394>Np63a
functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of p53 to promote proliferation and
block apoptosis. However, most SCCs concurrently overexpress <U+0394>Np63a and
inactivate p53, suggesting the autonomous action of these oncogenic events. Here 
we report the discovery of a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by
<U+0394>Np63a that reconciles these observations. We found that although both proteins
bind the same genomic sites, they regulate largely nonoverlapping gene sets. Upon
activation, p53 binds all enhancers regardless of <U+0394>Np63a status but fails to
transactivate genes repressed by <U+0394>Np63a. We found that <U+0394>Np63a associates with the
SRCAP chromatin regulatory complex involved in H2A/H2A.Z exchange and mediates
H2A.Z deposition at its target loci. Interestingly, knockdown of SRCAP subunits
or H2A.Z leads to specific induction of <U+0394>Np63a-repressed genes. We identified
SAMD9L as a key anti-proliferative gene repressed by <U+0394>Np63a and H2A.Z whose
depletion suffices to reverse the arrest phenotype caused by <U+0394>Np63a knockdown.
Collectively, these results illuminate a molecular pathway contributing to the
autonomous oncogenic effects of <U+0394>Np63a.

BACKGROUND: Multinucleated giant cell-containing tumors and pseudotumors of bone 
represent a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant lesions. Differential
diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in instances of limited sampling. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of the P63 in the positive
and differential diagnosis of giant cell tumor of bone.
METHODS: This study includes 48 giant cell-containing tumors and pseudotumors of 
bone. P63 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Data analysis was
performed using Epi-info software and SPSS software package (version 17).
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed a P63 nuclear expression in all
giant cell tumors of bone, in 50% of osteoid osteomas, 40% of aneurysmal bone
cysts, 37.5% of osteoblastomas, 33.3% of chondromyxoide fibromas, 25% of non
ossifiant fibromas and 8.3% of osteosarcomas. Only one case of chondroblastoma
was included in this series and expressed p63. No P63 immunoreactivity was
detected in any of the cases of central giant cell granulomas or langerhans cells
histiocytosis. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of P63
immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of giant cell tumor of bone were 100%. The
specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 74.42% and 59.26%
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found not only that GCTOB expresses the P63 but it also
shows that this protein may serve as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis
between two morphologically similar lesions particularly in instances of limited 
sampling. Indeed, P63 expression seems to differentiate between giant cell tumor 
of bone and central giant cell granuloma since the latter does not express P63.
Other benign and malignant giant cell-containing lesions express P63, decreasing 
its specificity as a diagnostic marker, but a strong staining was seen, except a 
case of chondroblastoma, only in giant cell tumor of bone. Clinical and
radiological confrontation remains essential for an accurate diagnosis.

p63 is highly expressed in some malignant tumors and is associated with
tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the 
clinical significance of p63 in colorectal cancer (CRC). p63 expression was
detected by immunohistochemistry in 66 CRC patients. Correlations between p63
expression and clinicopathological factors, progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Among the 66 CRC cases, 31 cases (47%)
exhibited a high score of p63 expression, while 35 cases (53%) were marked with a
low score. The p63 level correlated with peritumoral deposits (p=0.021). The
5-year OS rates in the low p63 score and high p63 score groups were,
respectively, 49% and 74% (p&lt;0.001). The 5-year PFS rates in the low p63 score
and high p63 score groups were, respectively, 44% and 71% (p&lt;0.001).
Univariate analysis revealed that p63 expression was correlated with OS and PFS. 
Multivariate analysis suggested that p63 expression was an independent prognostic
factor for OS (p=0.035). In conclusion, p63 was negatively correlated with
peritumoral deposits and positively associated with OS and PFS in CRC. The data
suggest that p63 is a potential prognostic factor for CRC.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Cervi cornus Colla (CCC) 
in the reconstruction of skin equivalent (SE). H&E staining showed that SE
containing hyaluronic acid (HA) or HA and CCC had a thicker epidermis than the
control SE. Immunohistochemical staining showed that p63 was mainly present at
the basal layer of the epidermis in the HA and CCC model. Involucrin was
obviously expressed in the upper layer of the epidermis in the HA and CCC model. 
Moreover, we observed that integrins a6 and ß1 were strongly expressed along the 
basement membrane zone in the HA and CCC model, in which the dermis expressing
type I collagen was more compact. In conclusion, our data indicate that CCC
contributed to the formation of epidermis, basement membrane, and extracellular
matrix in the reconstruction of SE and suggest that CCC may be a useful adjuvant 
in the reconstruction of SE.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignancy of oral cavity.
Human cancers are characterized by an imbalance of regulatory mechanisms
controlling different cellular pathways, including apoptosis. Apoptosis occurs in
a wide variety of physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue 
homeostasis or immune defense, and its role is to remove harmful, damaged, or
unwanted cells. Defective apoptosis represents an important causative factor in
the development/progression of cancer, and the ability of tumor cells to evade
apoptosis can play a significant role in their resistance to conventional
anticancer treatment. We investigated the expression profile of genes involved in
the apoptotic mechanism in 21 paired tissue samples (OSCC and adjacent normal
oral mucosa) by cDNA macroarray, in order to identify differentially expressed
genes in oral cancer compared to normal tissue. To validate the results obtained 
by cDNA macroarray, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and
immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Results obtained by cDNA macroarray 
analysis showed different expression levels of CRADD, FADD, ATM, APAF1, and TP63 
genes in OSCC compared to normal mucosa. Differential gene expression
measurements (tumor vs. normal tissue) performed by real-time PCR showed an
overexpression of FADD and a downregulation of ATM. Moreover, Western blot
analysis confirmed that both CRADD and APAF-1 were decreased in OSCC compared to 
normal oral mucosa. As showed by immunohistochemistry, OSCC exhibited increased
expression of p63 compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, a statistically
significant positive correlation was found between p63 expression and the
histological grade.

Papillary squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) has rarely been reported in the oral
cavity. Herein reported is a case of PSCC in the mandibular gum. A 70-year-old
man consulted our hospital because of a papillary tumor in the left mandibular
gum. Physical examination revealed an exophytic papillary tumor of the left
mandibular gum, and an excision of the tumor was performed. Grossly, the tumor
was exophytic and papillary, and measured 1 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Microscopically, the
tumor showed exophytic papillary proliferation with fibrovascular cores and
consisted of atypical squamous epithelial cells. The tumor cells showed
hyperchromasia, nuclear atypia, mitotic figures, apoptotic bodies, cancer pearls,
and individual keratinization. Mild stromal invasion was seen.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for pancytokeratin AE1/3,
pancytokeratin CAM5.2, p63, p53, and Ki-67 (labeling index=40%), but negative for
human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV in situ hybridization revealed no signals.
Therefore, PSCC was diagnosed. The lateral and vertical margins are negative for 
tumor cell. The pathological diagnosis was PSCC. The patient was healthy and free
from tumor three months after the operation.

The skin is constantly exposed to environmental oxidative stress. Skin equivalent
(SE) models are three-dimensional systems in which cell-cell or cell-matrix
interactions can be investigated. In this study, the effects of vitamin C or
plant extracts with high antioxidant activities were tested. There was no
significant difference in the epidermal thickness, but the basal cells became
cuboidal when vitamin C or plant extracts were supplemented. Furthermore,
immunohistochemical staining showed linear and intense staining of a6 and ß1
integrin along the basement membrane in vitamin C or plant extract treated
models. The p63 and PCNA were also stained. Results showed that the number of p63
and PCNA positive cells was higher in the vitamin C or plant extract treated
models than in the control SEs. Although the relationship between oxidative
stress and stem cells is not known, our results suggest that redox status affects
the stemness and the proliferative potential of epidermal basal cells by
modulating microenvironment to epidermal basal stem cells.

Glioblastoma is the most frequent brain tumor in adults and is the most lethal
form of human cancer. Despite the improvements in treatments, survival of
patients remains poor. To define novel pathways that regulate susceptibility to
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in glioma, we
have performed genome-wide expression profiling of microRNAs (miRs). We show that
in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells, levels of different miRs are increased, and in
particular, miR-30b/c and -21. We demonstrate that these miRs impair
TRAIL-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of key functional
proteins. T98G-sensitive cells treated with miR-21 or -30b/c become resistant to 
TRAIL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-30b/c and miR-21 target respectively 
the 3' untranslated region of caspase-3 and TAp63 mRNAs, and that those proteins 
mediate some of the effects of miR-30 and -21 on TRAIL resistance, even in human 
glioblastoma primary cells and in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, we show that 
high expression levels of miR-21 and -30b/c are needed to maintain the
TRAIL-resistant phenotype, thus making these miRs as promising therapeutic
targets for TRAIL resistance in glioma.

OBJECTIVES: This study consisted of two parts. One part was to analyze the
survival rates of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) in Chinese and explain the
difference between our data and the literature. The other was to analyze the
relationship between the expression of CD117 and the histological grade and the
prognosis.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 80 ACC patients was performed. Clinical data
were collected, and p63, CD117 were detected by immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: Eighty patients received follow-ups 3 to 216<U+2009>months after initial
diagnosis. ACC occurred in the lacrimal gland (26.3%, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>21), nasal cavity and
parasinus (33.8%, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>27) and other sites (40.0%, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>33). The 5-year and 10-year
survival rates were 66.41% and 10.16%, respectively. Over expression of CD117 was
detected in p63-negative cells in 94.3% of cases and in p63-positive cells in
45.8%. The expression of CD117 in p63-positive cells was significantly associated
with the histological grade (P<0.001) and prognosis (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.037) in patients in
the advanced stage.
CONCLUSIONS: ACC had a good 5-year survival but poor 10-year survival in Chinese,
which differed from the occidental data. More p63+/CD117+ cells were associated
with a higher histological grade and poorer outcome.

The p53 tumor suppressor belongs to a gene family that includes two other
structurally and functionally related members: p73 and p63. The regulation of p53
activity differs significantly from that of p73 and p63. To enhance the tumor
suppressive activity of p53, we constructed six recombinant adenoviruses that
encode hybrid proteins with three functional domains derived from either p53 or
TAp63<U+03B3>. The potency of these hybrid molecules in suppressing tumorigenesis was
evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models. Of the hybrid molecules tested, one 
hybrid named p63-53O was the most potent activator of apoptosis in human cancer
cells. The p63-53O hybrid is composed of the transcriptional activation domain
and DNA-binding domain of TAp63<U+03B3> and the oligomerization domain of p53. The
p63-53O hybrid efficiently transactivated p53AIP1. Moreover, silencing of p53AIP1
partially abolished the apoptotic response to p63-53O in human cancer cells. The 
p53-p63 hybrid molecule is a novel potent anti-proliferative agent for the
treatment of cancer.

Tumor protein (TP)-p53 family members (TP63, TP63 and TP73) are guardians of the 
genome and key players in orchestrating the cellular response to cisplatin
treatment. Cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a was shown to have a role
in regulating intracellular <U+0394>Np63a protein levels. We previously found that
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells exposed to cisplatin displayed the
ATM-dependent phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a (p-<U+0394>Np63a), which is critical for the
transcriptional regulation of specific downstream mRNAs and microRNAs and is
likely to underlie the chemoresistance of SCC cells. However, SCC cells
expressing non-p-<U+0394>Np63a became more cisplatin-resistant. We also found that
p-<U+0394>Np63a forms complexes with a number of proteins involved in cell death
response through regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, RNA
splicing and chromatin modifications. Here, we showed that p-<U+0394>Np63a induced ARG1,
GAPDH, and CPT2 gene transcription in cisplatin-sensitive SCC cells, while
non-p-<U+0394>Np63a increased a transcription of CAD, G6PD and FASN genes in
cisplatin-resistant SCC cells. We report that the p-<U+0394>Np63a-dependent regulatory
mechanisms implicated in the modulation of plethora of pathways, including amino 
acid, carbohydrate, lipid and nucleotide metabolisms, thereby affect tumor cell
response to cisplatin-induced cell death, suggesting that the ATM-dependent
<U+0394>Np63a pathway plays a role in the resistance of tumor cells to platinum therapy.

p63 inhibits metastasis. Here, we show that p63 (both TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 isoforms)
regulates expression of miR-205 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and miR-205 is
essential for the inhibitory effects of p63 on markers of epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), such as ZEB1 and vimentin. Correspondingly, the inhibitory
effect of p63 on EMT markers and cell migration is reverted by anti-miR-205. p53 
mutants inhibit expression of both p63 and miR-205, and the cell migration, in a 
cell line expressing endogenous mutated p53, can be abrogated by pre-miR-205 or
silencing of mutated p53. In accordance with this in vitro data, <U+0394>Np63 or miR-205
significantly inhibits the incidence of lung metastasis in vivo in a mouse tail
vein model. Similarly, one or both components of the p63/miR-205 axis were absent
in metastases or colonized lymph nodes in a set of 218 human prostate cancer
samples. This was confirmed in an independent clinical data set of 281 patients. 
Loss of this axis was associated with higher Gleason scores, an increased
likelihood of metastatic and infiltration events, and worse prognosis. These data
suggest that p63/miR-205 may be a useful clinical predictor of metastatic
behavior in prostate cancer.

Histological special types (HST) account for about 25% of breast cancers, and
correspond to at least 17 pathological entities. However, their molecular
characteristics remain to be determined. The purpose of the present study is to
apply the recently used immunohistochemical profiling of HST breast carcinomas
(BC), as a surrogate for the molecular subtyping, what could be relevant for
therapeutic purposes. One hundred and twenty-one cases were included.
Immunohistochemical study was performed on paraffin sections, including markers
for oestrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors, keratin 5, HER2/neu,
epithelial growth factor receptor, p63 protein, P-cadherin, and Ki-67. Tubular
(16 cases), mucinous (27) and papillary (9) types were all categorised as
luminal-like A and B. The medullary (21) and metaplastic (10) types corresponded 
largely to the basal-like tumours (85.7% and 90%, respectively). Cases of the
micropapillary type (8) were luminal A (3/8), luminal B (4/8) and HER2
overexpressing (1/8), whereas the apocrine carcinomas (24) presented a
heterogeneous profile. The proliferation rate (Ki-67) varied among the types,
being the medullary carcinoma subtype with higher proliferation. Comparing the
current data with those based on molecular studies, there was good agreement in
the classification of the tubular, mucinous and papillary types. Only a partial
concordance was achieved for the other types, which may be due to sampling, and
to the relatively low frequency of such cases. The present work supports the
clinical usage of immunohistochemistry as a surrogate to molecular classification
of special types of BC.

Epithelioid angiosarcoma of the parotid gland is rare, and may pose a great
diagnostic challenge. We report a case of primary epithelioid angiosarcoma in a
64-year-old male without history of radiation. The histopathological findings
demonstrated a high grade epithelioid neoplasm. Immunostaining showed that the
tumor was positive for the pan-cytokeratin, p63, cytokeratin18, Vimentin and
vascular markers CD31, and was negative for CD34, cytokeratin5/6, cytokeratin7,
cytokeratin20, CD68, CD30, S-100, HMB45, desmin, a-SMA and CD45. The tumor was
diagnosed as an epithelioid angiosarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first
reported case of angiosarcoma which showed common positivity for cytokeratin and 
p63. In addition to cytokeratin, p63 is considered a useful marker for carcinoma.
The co-expression of cytokeratin and p63 in epithelioid angiosarcoma represents a
diagnostic pitfall. Thus, using a panel of antibodies is essential for
distinguishing this tumor from poorly differentiated carcinoma. Virtual slides:

The basis for impaired differentiation in TP63 mutant ankyloblepharon-ectodermal 
dysplasia-clefting (AEC) syndrome is unknown. Human epidermis harboring AEC TP63 
mutants recapitulated this impairment, along with downregulation of
differentiation activators, including HOPX, GRHL3, KLF4, PRDM1, and ZNF750.
Gene-set enrichment analysis indicated that disrupted expression of epidermal
differentiation programs under the control of ZNF750 and KLF4 accounted for the
majority of disrupted epidermal differentiation resulting from AEC mutant TP63.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and ChIP-sequencing of TP63 binding
in differentiated keratinocytes revealed ZNF750 as a direct target of wild-type
and AEC mutant TP63. Restoring ZNF750 to AEC model tissue rescued activator
expression and differentiation, indicating that AEC TP63-mediated ZNF750
inhibition contributes to differentiation defects in AEC. Incorporating
disease-causing mutants into regenerated human tissue can thus dissect
pathomechanisms and identify targets that reverse disease features.

PURPOSE: Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of human MRC-5 cells to
act as a feeder layer for conjunctival epithelial cells in order to develop a
complete xenobiotic-free culture system for the expansion of conjunctival
epithelial progenitor cells for clinical applications.
METHODS: Human conjunctival epithelial cells were expanded from a bulbar biopsy, 
in a completely xenobiotic-free culture system using growth arrested MRC-5 cells 
as a feeder layer, without (MRC-5/No Serum) and in the presence of 5% (MRC-5/HS
5%) or 10% (MRC-5/HS 10%) human serum. The total cell count, the surface area as 
well as the total colony-forming efficiency (CFE), the percentage of aborted
colonies and the expression of putative progenitor cell markers p63a, ABCG2, CK15
was compared to the gold standard culture system (GS) in which growth arrested
3T3 feeder cells and feotal calf serum were used.
RESULTS: The epithelial cell count revealed significantly less proliferation in
the MRC-5/No Serum group compared to the GS conditions. All groups showed
immunoreactivity to CK19; however, more differentiated epithelial cells were
observed in the MRC-5/No Serum- and MRC-5/HS 10%-group and less immunoreactivity 
to p63 a and ABCG2 was found in these groups compared to GS and MRC-5/HS 5%
conditions. This was in accordance with CFE results, were the MRC-5/HS 5% group
showed similar CFE results compared to the GS group, while in the MRC-5/No Serum-
and MRC-5/HS 10%-group significantly lower CFE's were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a completely xenobiotic-free culture
system using MRC-5 cells as a feeder layer in combination with human serum can be
successfully used to expand conjunctival epithelial cells with progenitor cell
characteristics and might be a useful tool for the safe expansion of these cells 
for clinical use.

Some researchs have demonstrated that the loss of delta Np63 is associated with
aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. However, other research indicates that 
delta Np63 is considered to have oncogenic properties. Delta Np63 overexpression 
is often observed in association with the oncogenic growth of squamous cell
carcinomas and bladder cancer. In this study, we investigated the oncogenic role 
of delta Np63 in regulating cell adhesion in transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder (TCCB). The cells were stably transfected with the delta Np63 short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid. Immunocytochemistry was performed to determine the
knockdown efficiency. Tumour cells were studied for their ability to adhere to
vascular endothelial cells. Confocal microscopy was used to analyse the changes
in cytoskeletal F-actin. F-actin expression was measured by flow cytometry. Cell 
invasion ability was assessed using transwell chambers. The delta Np63-silenced
tumour cells were shown to adhere more tightly than controls to vascular
endothelial cells (P<0.05). The content of F-actin in the delta Np63-silenced
cells was enhanced (P<0.05). The Matrigel invasion assays showed that human 5637 
bladder cancer cells had a lower degree of motility when transfected with pdelta 
Np63-shRNA (P<0.05). In conclusion, silencing of the delta Np63 expression can
enhance the adhesiveness of 5637 cells by inducing F-actin cytoskeleton
production, and it will possibly inhibit the TCCB invasion and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer in Indonesia is the 3rd ranking cancer among males 
and the 5th rank for their cancer mortality. Prognostic markers that can identify
aggressive prostate cancer in early stages and help select appropriate therapy to
finally reduce the mortality are therefore urgently needed. It has been suggested
that stem cells in the prostate gland have a role in initiation, progression, and
metastasis of cancer, although controversy continues to exist. Maintenance of
normal stem cell or reserve cell populations in several epithelia including
prostate has been shown to be regulated by p63 and alteration of p63 expression
is considered to have an oncogenic role in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that
the expression of cytoplasmic aberrance of p63 is associated with high ALDH1A1
expression as a cancer stem cell marker, thus leading to progression of prostate 
cancer.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study during two years (2009-2010), a total of
79 paraffin embedded tissues of benign prostatic hyperplasia, PIN prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia, low and high Gleason score prostate cancer were
investigated using immunohistochemistry. Associations between cytoplasmic p63 and
ALDH1A1, as well as with pathological diagnosis, were analyzed by Chi-Square test
using SPSS 15.0. Links of both markers with cell proliferation rate (KI-67) and
apoptotic rate (cleaved caspase 3) were also analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS: The mean age of patient at the diagnosis is 70.0 years. Cytoplasmic
aberrance of p63 was associated with ALDH1A1 expression (p<0.001) and both were
found to have significant relationships with pathological diagnosis (including
Gleason score), (p=0.006 and p<0.001 respectively). Moreover, it was also found
that higher levels of cytoplasmic p63 were significantly associated with the
frequency of proliferating cells and cells undergoing apoptosis in prostate
cancers (p=0.001 and p=0.016 respectively).
CONCLUSION: p63 cytoplasmic aberrance is associated with high ALDH1A1 expression.
These components are suggested to have an important role in prostate cancer
progression and may be used as molecular markers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathologic and immunohistochemical features,
diagnosis and differential diagnosis of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma of the 
breast and syringomatous adenoma of the nipple.
METHODS: Six cases of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma of the breast and four
cases of syringomatous adenoma of the nipple were examined histologically and
immunohistochemically (MaxVision method), and the literature was reviewed.
RESULTS: The two types of tumors were similar in morphology, but located in
different regions with low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma being present in the
deep parenchyma and syringomatous adenoma in nipple. Both types of tumors were
composed mainly of well-differentiated glands with angulated, comma shaped or
polliwog appearance in a disordered infiltrative pattern. The tumor cells also
formed solid tubules, strips or nests, with frequent areas of squamoid
differentiation. Mitosis was rare. The interstitial tissue showed abundant
spindle cells or sclerotic fibrosis with mixed inflammatory cells infiltration.
One case of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma showed a concomitant malignant
adenomyoepithelioma, and another case showed concomitant spindle cell metaplastic
carcinoma. One case of syringomatous adenoma involved the deep parenchyma.
Immunohistochemistry of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma showed that CK5/6 and
p63 were positive in the outer layer of the glands and the squamoid epithelium,
and CD10 was also positive in the outer layer of the glands. ER and HER2 were
negative, and PR was also negative except for one case in which the spindle cells
were positive for CK5/6, AE1/AE3 and PR focally. Immunostaining of syringomatous 
adenoma demonstrated that p63 and CK5/6 were positive in the outer layer of the
glands and the squamoid epithelium. Calponin, SMA, ER, PR and HER2 were all
negative.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma of the breast and syringomatous
adenoma of the nipple are similar in morphology and immunohistochemical
phenotype, while the biological features are opposite due to different locations.
The differential diagnoses include tubular carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma,
radial sclerosing lesions and others.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are aggressive malignancies of mature T
lymphocytes with 5-year overall survival rates of only ~ 35%. Improvement in
outcomes has been stymied by poor understanding of the genetics and molecular
pathogenesis of PTCL, with a resulting paucity of molecular targets for therapy. 
We developed bioinformatic tools to identify chromosomal rearrangements using
genome-wide, next-generation sequencing analysis of mate-pair DNA libraries and
applied these tools to 16 PTCL patient tissue samples and 6 PTCL cell lines.
Thirteen recurrent abnormalities were identified, of which 5 involved p53-related
genes (TP53, TP63, CDKN2A, WWOX, and ANKRD11). Among these abnormalities were
novel TP63 rearrangements encoding fusion proteins homologous to <U+0394>Np63, a
dominant-negative p63 isoform that inhibits the p53 pathway. TP63 rearrangements 
were seen in 11 (5.8%) of 190 PTCLs and were associated with inferior overall
survival; they also were detected in 2 (1.2%) of 164 diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas. As TP53 mutations are rare in PTCL compared with other malignancies,
our findings suggest that a constellation of alternate genetic abnormalities may 
contribute to disruption of p53-associated tumor suppressor function in PTCL.

Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat, and the presence of metastases
greatly reduces a cancer patient's likelihood of long-term survival. The ZEB1
transcriptional repressor promotes metastasis through downregulation of microRNAs
(miRs) that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of
stem cell factors. Given that each miR can target multiple genes with diverse
functions, we posited that the prometastatic network controlled by ZEB1 extends
beyond these processes. We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of human
lung adenocarcinoma metastasis driven by ZEB1, human lung carcinoma cells, and
human breast carcinoma cells. Transcriptional profiling studies revealed that
ZEB1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRs,
including miR-34a. Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased tumor cell invasion
and metastasis, inhibited the formation of promigratory cytoskeletal structures, 
suppressed activation of the RHO GTPase family, and regulated a gene expression
signature enriched in cytoskeletal functions and predictive of outcome in human
lung adenocarcinomas. We identified several miR-34a target genes, including
Arhgap1, which encodes a RHO GTPase activating protein that was required for
tumor cell invasion. These findings demonstrate that ZEB1 drives prometastatic
actin cytoskeletal remodeling by downregulating miR-34a expression and provide a 
compelling rationale to develop miR-34a as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer
patients.

We report the case of a high-grade carcinoma involving the kidney in a young male
with renal vein thrombosis and review the differential diagnosis and
immunohistochemical workup. High-grade neoplasms involving the renal sinus
include collecting duct carcinomas (CDCs), renal medullary carcinomas (RMCs),
invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the upper urinary tract, clear
cell renal cell carcinoma, and type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma.
Distinguishing UC from CDC and RMC is problematic in small biopsy samples. The
diagnosis of CDC (a rare, aggressive subtype of renal cell carcinoma) is
challenging and requires the exclusion of UC. Renal medullary carcinoma is
characterized by an appropriate clinical setting and consistent loss of nuclear
expression of integrase interactor 1 (INI-1). A panel consisting of p63, paired
box gene 8 (PAX8), and INI-1 is most optimal in distinguishing UC from CDC and
RMC. A subset of urothelial carcinoma of upper urinary tract may be positive with
PAX8.

This study was designed to (1) assess the in vitro biocompatibility of a
chitosan-collagen composite scaffold (C3) constructed by blending commercial
chitosan and tilapia scale collagen with oral mucosa keratinocytes, (2)
histologically and immunohistochemically characterize an ex vivo-produced oral
mucosa equivalent constructed using the C3 (EVPOME-C), and (3) compare EVPOME-C
with oral mucosa constructs utilizing AlloDerm® (EVPOME-A), BioMend® Extend
(EVPOME-B), and native oral mucosa. C3 scaffold had a well-developed fibril
network and a sufficiently small porosity to prevent keratinocytes from growing
inside the scaffold after cell-seeding. The EVPOME oral mucosa constructs were
fabricated in a chemically defined culture system. After culture at an air-liquid
interface, EVPOME-C and EVPOME-B had multilayered epithelium with keratinization,
while EVPOME-A had a more organized stratified epithelium. Ki-67 and p63
immunolabeled cells in the basal layer of all EVPOMEs suggested a regenerative
ability. Compared with native oral mucosa, the keratin 15 and 10/13 expression
patterns in all EVPOMEs showed a less-organized differentiation pattern. In
contrast to the ß1-integrin and laminin distribution in EVPOME-A and native oral 
mucosa, the subcellular deposition in EVPOME-C and EVPOME-B indicated that
complete basement membrane formation failed. These findings demonstrated that C3 
has a potential application for epithelial tissue engineering and provides a new 
potential therapeutic device for oral mucosa regenerative medicine.

Transcriptional regulators of the <U+0394>Np63: their role in limbal epithelial cell
proliferation.

The surface cells of corneal epithelium are regularly shed off and replaced by
new cells that are derived from limbal epithelial stem cells (LESC). LESC are
believed to reside in the basal layer of the limbal epithelium and are
characterized with high expression levels of <U+0394>Np63, a transcription factor (TF)
which is believed to play roles in the regulation of LESC proliferation. In this 
study, we examined the transcriptional regulation of <U+0394>Np63 in limbal epithelial
cell. We employed DNA pull down assay followed by LC/MS analysis and cDNA
microarray analysis to identify the TFs that were capable of binding to <U+0394>Np63
promoter or were expressed at higher levels in limbus over cornea. The TFs thus
selected were further examined for their in vivo <U+0394>Np63 promoter binding by
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We identified six putative TFs (PAX6, EGR1, 
CEBPB, JUN, ATF3, and ARID5B) through the aforementioned approaches. Among them, 
PAX6 and EGR1 were shown to promote the transcription of <U+0394>Np63 and led to
increased cell proliferation. In contrast, CEBPB and ATF3 appeared to exert
little or no effect on <U+0394>Np63 expression, however, their silencing suppressed cell
proliferation. Although JUN exhibited low promoter-binding specificity, however, 
it affected <U+0394>Np63 expression and limbal epithelial cell proliferation in ways
similar to that of PAX6 and EGR1. Intriguingly, ARID5B was highly expressed in
the limbal epithelial cell, however, its silencing by siRNA did not obviously
affect the expression of <U+0394>Np63, nor did it reduce cell proliferation of the
limbal epithelial cell.

The Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) belongs to the cold-shock domain protein
superfamily, one of the most evolutionarily conserved nucleic acid-binding
proteins currently known. YB-1 performs a wide variety of cellular functions,
including transcriptional and translational regulation, DNA repair, drug
resistance, and stress responses to extracellular signals. Inasmuch as the level 
of YB-1 drastically increases in tumor cells, this protein is considered to be
one of the most indicative markers of malignant tumors. Here, we present evidence
that <U+0394>Np63a, the predominant p63 protein isoform in squamous epithelia and YB-1, 
can physically interact. Into the nucleus, <U+0394>Np63a and YB-1 cooperate in PI3KCA
gene promoter activation. Moreover, <U+0394>Np63a promotes YB-1 nuclear accumulation
thereby reducing the amount of YB-1 bound to its target transcripts such as that 
encoding the SNAIL1 protein. Accordingly, <U+0394>Np63a enforced expression was
associated with a reduction of the level of SNAIL1, a potent inducer of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, <U+0394>Np63a depletion causes
morphological change and enhanced formation of actin stress fibers in squamous
cancer cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that <U+0394>Np63a affects cell movement and 
can reverse the increase of cell motility induced by YB-1 overexpression. These
data thus suggest that <U+0394>Np63a provides inhibitory signals for cell motility.
Deficiency of <U+0394>Np63a gene expression promotes cell mobilization, at least
partially, through a YB-1-dependent mechanism.

Regulation of DCIS to invasive breast cancer progression by Singleminded-2s
(SIM2s).

Singleminded-2s (SIM2s) is a member of the bHLH/PAS family of transcription
factors and a key regulator of mammary epithelial cell differentiation. SIM2s is 
highly expressed in mammary epithelial cells and downregulated in human breast
cancer. Loss of Sim2s causes aberrant mouse mammary ductal development, with
features suggestive of malignant transformation, whereas overexpression of SIM2s 
promotes precocious alveolar differentiation in nulliparous mouse mammary glands,
suggesting that SIM2s is required for establishing and enhancing mammary gland
differentiation. To test the hypothesis that SIM2s regulates tumor cell
differentiation, we analyzed SIM2s expression in human primary breast ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) samples and found that SIM2s is lost with progression
from DCIS to invasive ductal cancer (IDC). Using a MCF10DCIS.COM progression
model, we have shown that SIM2s expression is decreased in MCF10DCIS.COM cells
compared with MCF10A cells, and reestablishment of SIM2s in MCF10DCIS.COM cells
significantly inhibits growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of
SIM2s-MCF10DCIS.com tumors showed that SIM2s promoted a more differentiated tumor
phenotype including the expression of a broad range of luminal markers (CSN2
(ß-casein), CDH1 (E-cadherin), and KER18 (keratin-18)) and suppressed genes
associated with stem cell maintenance and a basal phenotype (SMO (smoothened),
p63, SLUG (snail-2), KER14 (keratin-14) and VIM (vimentin)). Furthermore, loss of
SIM2s expression in MCF10DCIS.COM xenografts resulted in a more invasive
phenotype and increased lung metastasis likely due to an increase in Hedgehog
signaling and matrix metalloproteinase expression. Together, these exciting new
data support a role for SIM2s in promoting human breast tumor differentiation and
maintaining epithelial integrity.

Distinguishing adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is
often based on morphological criteria and can be difficult in small biopsies. We 
analyzed commonly used immunohistochemical markers (p63, cytokeratin 5/6,
cytokeratin 7, CDX2, MUC2, and MUC5AC) and 2 new markers, anterior gradient
homolog 2 and SOX2, in esophageal carcinomas to establish the best panel to
distinguish these tumors. Tissue microarrays with 69 esophageal adenocarcinomas
and 41 whole sections of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were stained for
these markers and semiquantitatively scored. Sensitivities and specificities were
calculated for individual markers and select combinations using the morphological
diagnosis as a gold standard. All squamous cell carcinomas expressed p63 with 38 
of 41 demonstrating reactivity in more than 75% of tumor cells. Cytokeratin 5/6
expression was seen in 40 of 41 squamous cell carcinomas with 39 of 41
demonstrating reactivity in more than 75% of tumor cells. SOX2 expression was
present in 35 of 41 of squamous cell carcinomas but also in 24 of 69 of
adenocarcinomas, frequently demonstrating extensive reactivity in
adenocarcinomas. Anterior gradient homolog 2 was highly sensitive for
adenocarcinoma and present in 68 of 69 of cases, but anterior gradient homolog 2 
reactivity was also identified in 15 of 41 of squamous cell carcinomas, typically
demonstrating focal reactivity in squamous cell carcinoma. MUC5AC expression was 
seen almost exclusively in adenocarcinomas with only a single squamous cell
carcinoma demonstrating focal MUC5AC staining. Overall, the dual expression of
both p63 and cytokeratin 5/6 was 99% specific and 98% sensitive for squamous cell
carcinoma. In addition, anterior gradient homolog 2 and MUC5AC are useful
positive markers of adenocarcinoma in the setting of absent or diminished p63 and
cytokeratin 5/6 staining.

A novel de novo missense mutation in TP63 underlying germline mosaicism in AEC
syndrome: implications for recurrence risk and prenatal diagnosis.

Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a rare
autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndrome. It is caused by heterozygous
mutations in TP63, encoding a transcriptional factor of the p53 family. Mutations
in TP63, mainly missense in exons 13 and 14 encoding the sterile alpha motif
(SAM) and the transactivation inhibitory (TI) domains, account for 99% of
mutations in individuals with AEC syndrome. Of these, =70% are de novo mutations,
present in the affected patient, but not in parents nor in healthy siblings.
However, when a mutation appears de novo, it is not possible to differentiate
between a sporadic mutation, or germline mosaicism in the parents. In this latter
case, there is a risk of having additional affected offspring. We describe two
sisters with AEC syndrome, whose parents were unaffected. Both patients carried
the heterozygous c.1568T>C substitution in exon 13 of TP63, resulting in a
p.L523P change in the SAM domain of the protein. Analyses of DNA from parental
blood cells, seminal fluid (from the father) and maternal cells (buccal, vaginal,
and cervical) did not reveal the mutation, suggesting that the mosaicism may
involve a very low percentage of cells (very low grade somatic mosaicism) or,
more likely, maternal gonadal mosaicism. Mosaicism must be considered for the
assessment of recurrence risk during genetic counseling in AEC syndrome, and
pre-implantation/prenatal genetic diagnosis should be offered to all couples,
even when the mutation is apparently de novo.

Identification of the cellular mechanisms that mediate cancer cell
chemosensitivity is important for developing new cancer treatment strategies.
Several chemotherapeutic drugs increase levels of the posttranslational modifier 
ISG15, which suggests that ISGylation could suppress oncogenesis. However, how
ISGylation of specific target proteins controls tumorigenesis is unknown. Here,
we identified proteins that are ISGylated in response to chemotherapy. Treatment 
of a human mammary epithelial cell line with doxorubicin resulted in ISGylation
of the p53 family protein p63. An alternative splice variant of p63, <U+0394>Np63a,
suppressed the transactivity of other p53 family members, and its expression was 
abnormally elevated in various human epithelial tumors, suggestive of an
oncogenic role for this variant. We showed that ISGylation played an essential
role in the downregulation of <U+0394>Np63a. Anticancer drugs, including doxorubicin,
induced <U+0394>Np63a ISGylation and caspase-2 activation, leading to cleavage of
ISGylated <U+0394>Np63a in the nucleus and subsequent release of its inhibitory domain
to the cytoplasm. ISGylation ablated the ability of <U+0394>Np63a to promote
anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor formation in vivo as well to suppress
the transactivities of proapoptotic p53 family members. These findings establish 
ISG15 as a tumor suppressor via its conjugation to <U+0394>Np63a and provide a molecular
rationale for therapeutic use of doxorubicin against <U+0394>Np63a-mediated cancers.

AIMS: To investigate the expression of microRNAs miR-21, miR-31, miR-203,
miR-125a-5p and miR-125b and proteins phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and
p63 in verrucous carcinoma (VC) of the head and neck.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty cases of VC, 50 cases of conventional squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and 30 samples of normal epithelium of the head and neck were
included. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used 
to analyse the expression of microRNAs and proteins, respectively. In comparison 
to normal epithelium, miR-21 was overexpressed in both VC and SCC and miR-31 was 
overexpressed in VC and in well- and moderately differentiated SCC. Levels of
miR-203 were elevated in VC but unaltered or reduced in SCC, and levels of
miR-125a-5p and miR-125b were reduced in VC but unaltered in SCC. PTEN was
down-regulated in both VC and SCC, whereas p63 was down-regulated in VC but
up-regulated in SCC. Differential expression of p63 in VC correlated inversely
with the expression of miR-21 and miR-203.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences between VC, SCC and normal epithelium in expression
profiles of investigated molecules indicate their association with the
pathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of VC. Our results suggest
that some microRNAs and proteins, particularly miR-125b, miR-203 and p63, might
be useful in the diagnosis of VC.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the common cancers with a
poor prognosis. Incidences of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection range from 0
to 67% in different parts of the world. It has been frequently associated with
high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18. The present study analyzes the prevalence of
HPV infection in ESCC tumor and adjoining mucosa. Fresh tissue samples were
obtained from ESCC tumor (group I) and adjoining mucosa (group II). Aliquots of
DNA extracts were used. There were 23 patients with paired samples, 19 (83%) were
male. HPV was positive in 20/23 (87%). Mean age of HPV positive in group I was
56.63 ± 6.96 and in group II 54.31 ± 7.13 years (P > 0.05). Majority had more
than one viral type. HPV52 was the most common observed in 14 (61%) males and two
(9%) females. Other common viruses were HPV55, 39, and 59. Smoking had a
significant association with viral positivity. p63 and p16 oncoproteins
correlated with degree of tumor differentiation but not with viral status. We
documented high prevalence of high-risk HPV in ESCC. Our observations support the
concept of persistent infection by an oncogenic HPV in cancer development. Our
study highlights importance of documenting viral genotype in a defined geographic
area.

PURPOSE: To determine the effect of riboflavin-UV-A treatment on the corneal
limbal epithelial cells during a corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) procedure.
METHODS: Thirty freshly enucleated human cadaveric eyeballs were subjected to a
CXL procedure, mimicking the clinical protocol. During the UV-A exposure, one
half of the limbus (sector A) was left unprotected, whereas the other half
(sector B) was covered by a metal shield. Limbal biopsies from both sectors
before and after the procedure were analyzed. Each strip of tissue was divided
into 3 segments, for cell count of viable cells, for cultivation on human
amniotic membrane (HAM), and for stem cell and differentiated corneal epithelial 
cell marker studies using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Compared with the cell count before CXL, there was a statistically
significant drop in the mean number of viable cells after CXL in sector A but not
in sector B. Biopsies from both sectors before CXL and from sector B after CXL
showed good growth on HAM. Biopsies from sector A after CXL showed no growth on
HAM. The putative stem cell marker ABCG2 was absent in all samples and p63 was
absent in 3 of 10 samples taken from sector A after CXL. All markers were present
in all samples from sector B after CXL.
CONCLUSIONS: Riboflavin-UV-A treatment can result in damage to limbal epithelial 
cells, particularly the stem cells. Covering the limbal region with a metal
shield effectively prevents this damage.

Cisplatin chemoresistance is a clinical problem that leads to treatment failure
in various human epithelial cancers. Members of tumor protein (TP) p53 family
play various critical roles in the multiple molecular mechanisms underlying the
chemoresistance of tumor cells. However, the in-depth mechanisms of the cellular 
response to cisplatin-induced cell death are still under thorough investigation. 
We previously showed that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells exposed to
cisplatin display an ATM-dependent phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a, leading to a
specific function of the phosphorylated (p)-<U+0394>Np63a transcription factor in
cisplatin-sensitive tumor cells. We further found that SCC cells expressing
non-p-<U+0394>Np63a-S385G became cisplatin-resistant. Using quantitative
mass-spectrometry of protein complexes labeled with isobaric tags, we showed that
TP53 and <U+0394>Np63a are involved in numerous protein-protein interactions, which are 
likely to be implicated in the response of tumor cells to cisplatin exposure. We 
found that p-<U+0394>Np63a binds to the splicing complex, leading to repression of mRNA 
splicing and activation of ACIN1-mediated cell death pathway. In contrast to
p-<U+0394>Np63a, non-p-<U+0394>Np63a fails to bind the critical members of the splicing
complex, thereby leading to activation of RNA splicing and reduction of cell
death pathway. Overall, our studies provide an integrated proteomic platform in
making a case for the role of the p53/p63 interactome in cisplatin
chemoresistance.

cases of NAs were studied by performing immunohistochemistry for PAX8, p63,
CK903, PSA, S100A1, BerEP4, and CEA on routine tissue sections. PAX8 showed
diffuse moderate to strong (2+ and 3+) nuclear staining in all of NAs (n = 6 and 
15, respectively) and negative in the normal urothelium (n = 15). Nuclear
staining for p63 was not seen in any case of NAs examined (n = 19) and was
diffuse and strong (3+) in the normal urothelium (n = 14). High-molecular-weight 
keratin CK903 showed weak (1+) diffuse staining in all of the NAs examined (n =
19) and diffuse and moderate to strong positivity in the normal urothelium (n =
16). PSA staining was negative in both of the NAs (n = 21) and normal urothelium 
(n = 16). S100A1 showed strong (3+) diffuse staining in 19 of 20 of the NAs
examined (n = 19) and diffuse weak (1+) (n = 14) to moderate (n = 3) staining in 
the normal urothelium. BerEP4 showed focal to diffuse, mild to moderate (1+ and
2+) cytoplasmic staining in all of NAs (n = 2 and 19) and negative in the normal 
urothelium (n = 19). CEA staining was negative in both of the NAs (n = 21) and
normal urothelium (n = 17). A panel composed of PAX8, p63, PSA, S100A1, and CEA
appears to be sensitive and specific in differentiating NA from its mimics of
urothelial and prostatic origins.

OBJECTIVE: A set of cell proliferation-related molecular markers was used to
detect the differences in proliferative activity between benign pleomorphic
adenoma (PA) and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA).
STUDY DESIGN: Seventy samples comprising 53 PAs, 10 noninvasive and 7 widely
invasive (WI) CXPAs were selected. Immunohistochemical staining was used to
detect Ki-67, cyclin E, and p63 expression.
RESULTS: The average Ki-67 labeling index of WI CXPAs was higher than that of PAs
and the malignant component of noninvasive CXPAs (M-noninvasive CXPA; P < .01).
An increased cyclin E-positive staning was observed in M-noninvasive CXPAs and WI
CXPAs compared with PAs (P = .006). The p63 expression levels were notably
decreased in M-noninvasive CXPAs and WI CXPAs compared with PAs (P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: The data support that increased or decreased expression of Ki-67,
cyclin E, and p63 may indicate the proliferative differences between PA and CXPA.

express other embryonic stem cell markers.

PURPOSE: The presence of multipotent human limbal stromal cells resembling
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) provides new insights to the characteristic of
these cells and its therapeutic potential. However, little is known about the
expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA-4) and the embryonic stem 
cell (ESC)-like properties of these cells. We studied the expression of SSEA-4
surface protein and the various ESC and MSC markers in the ex vivo cultured
limbal stromal cells. The phenotypes and multipotent differentiation potential of
these cells were also evaluated.
METHODS: Limbal stromal cells were derived from corneoscleral rims. The SSEA-4(+)
and SSEA-4(-) limbal stromal cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cells
sorting (FACS). Isolated cells were expanded and reanalyzed for their expression 
of SSEA-4. Expression of MSC and ESC markers on these cells were also analyzed by
FACS. In addition, expression of limbal epithelial and corneal stromal proteins
such as ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), tumour protein p63
(p63), paired box 6 (Pax6), cytokeratin 3 (AE5), cytokeratin 10, and keratocan
sulfate were evaluated either by immunofluorecence staining or reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction. Appropriate induction medium was used to
differentiate these cells into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes.
RESULTS: Expanded limbal stromal cells expressed the majority of mesenchymal
markers. These cells were negative for ABCG2, p63, Pax6, AE-5, and keratocan
sulfate. After passaged, a subpopulation of these cells showed low expression of 
SSEA-4 but were negative for other important ESC surface markers such as
Tra-1-60, Tra-1-81, and transcription factors like octamer-binding transcription 
factor 4 (Oct4), SRY(sex determining region Y)-box 2 (Sox2), and Nanog. Early
passaged cells when induced were able to differentiate into adipocytes,
osteocytes and chondrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: The expanded limbal stromal cells showed features of multipotent
MSC. Our study confirmed the expression of SSEA-4 by a subpopulation of cultured 
limbal stromal cells. However, despite the expression of SSEA-4, these cells did 
not express any other markers of ESC. Therefore, we conclude that the cells did
not show properties of ESC.

Nucleus accumbens-1 (NAC1), a nuclear factor belonging to the BTB/POZ gene
family, has emerging roles in cancer. We report here that NAC1 acts as a negative
regulator of cellular senescence in transformed and nontransformed cells, and
dysfunction of NAC1 induces senescence and inhibits its oncogenic potential. We
show that NAC1 deficiency markedly activates senescence and inhibits
proliferation in tumor cells treated with sublethal doses of <U+03B3>-irradiation. In
mouse embryonic fibroblasts from NAC1 knockout mice, following infection with a
Ras virus, NAC1-/- cells undergo significantly more senescence and are either
nontransformed or less transformed in vitro and less tumorigenic in vivo when
compared with NAC1+/+ cells. Furthermore, we show that the NAC1-caused senescence
blunting is mediated by <U+0394>Np63, which exerts its effect on senescence through p21,
and that NAC1 activates transcription of <U+0394>Np63 under stressful conditions. Our
results not only reveal a previously unrecognized function of NAC1, the molecular
pathway involved and its impact on pathogenesis of tumor initiation and
development, but also identify a novel senescence regulator that may be exploited
as a potential target for cancer prevention and treatment.

The KIT-inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) has greatly improved the treatment of
metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). IM exhibits strong
antiproliferative effects but fails to induce sufficient levels of apoptosis
resulting in low pathologic complete remission rates and a high rate of secondary
progression in the metastatic setting. Upregulation of p53 by MDM2 inhibitors has
been shown to induce apoptosis in p53 wildtype tumors. Analyzing a series of 62
mostly untreated, localized and metastatic GIST we detected a low rate (3%) of
inactivating p53 mutations, thus providing a rationale for further exploration of
p53-directed therapeutic strategies. To this end, we studied nutlin-3, an
inhibitor of the p53 antagonist MDM2, and RITA, a putative p53 activator, in GIST
cell lines. Nutlin-3 effectively induced p53 at therapeutically relevant levels, 
which resulted in moderate antiproliferative effects and cell cycle arrest in p53
wildtype GIST cell lines GIST430, GIST48 and GIST48B. P53 reactivation
substantially improved the apoptotic response after effective KIT inhibition with
sunitinib and 17-AAG in IM-resistant cell lines. The commonly used
imatinib-sensitive cell lines GIST882 and GIST-T1 were shown to harbor defective 
p53 and therefore failed to respond to nutlin-3 treatment. RITA induced p53 in
GIST48B, followed by antiproliferative effects and a strong induction of
apoptosis. Surprisingly, GIST-T1 was also highly sensitive to RITA despite
lacking functional p53. This suggested a more complex, p53-independent mechanism 
of action for the latter compound. No antagonistic effects from p53-activating
drugs were seen with any drug combination. Our data provide first evidence that
modulation of the MDM2/p53 pathway may be therapeutically useful to improve the
apoptotic response of KIT-inhibitory drugs in the treatment of naïve GIST, with
p53 mutation status being a predictive factor of response.

The tumor suppressor p53 is pivotal in cell growth arrest and apoptosis upon
cellular stresses including DNA damage. Mounting evidence indicates that p63
proteins, which are homologs of p53, are also involved in apoptosis under certain
circumstances. In this study, we found that treatment with DNA damage agents
leads to down-regulation of <U+0394>Np63a and induces apoptosis in FaDu and HaCat cells 
carrying mutant p53. Further study shows that DNA damage reduces steady-state
mRNA level of <U+0394>Np63a, but has little effect on its protein stability. In
addition, knockdown of endogenous <U+0394>Np63a directly induces apoptosis and
sensitizes cells to DNA damage, while exogenous expression of <U+0394>Np63a partially
confers cellular resistance to DNA damage. Together, these data suggest that DNA 
damage down-regulates <U+0394>Np63a, which may directly contribute to DNA damage-induced
apoptosis.

We document three new patients with fibular agenesis, tibial campomelia, and
oligosyndactyly (FATCO). Two of these individuals had tetramelic manifestations
while the third had bilateral abnormalities of the lower limbs. These patients
and others reported as FATCO seem to belong to the phenotype "fibular aplasia
with ectrodactyly." Genetic screening for CNVs and mutations in the TP63 and
WNT10B genes did not show any genetic abnormalities. ©

Clear cell variant of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the salivary glands is rare. A 
55-year-old male patient with recently growing left parotid mass underwent
superficial parotidectomy. Although the dominant component of the tumor was
composed of clear cells, mucin containing cells were also present.
Histochemically, alcian blue stain supported intracellular mucin positivity.
Immunohistochemically, p63 was positive. Based on the morphological,
histochemical and immunohistochemical findings, the case was diagnosed as
mucoepidermoid carcinoma, clear cell variant.

Expression of the p63 tumor suppressor protein has been reported in the
mononuclear stromal cells of giant cell tumor of the bone, which may represent
osteoblast-precursor cells. Only a limited number of osteoblastic tumors have
been studied for p63 expression thus far. We therefore examined whether p63 may
serve as a marker for osteoblastic differentiation in osteosarcomas or as a
differential diagnostic marker to distinguish osteoblastoma from osteosarcoma.
Immunohistochemical stains for p63 were performed on a tissue microarray
containing 71 chemotherapy naïve biopsy samples of osteosarcoma, 21 whole
sections of osteosarcoma, and 8 osteoblastomas. Nuclear p63 was detected in seven
of eight osteoblastomas but was restricted to stromal cells within primitive,
immature-appearing areas of osteoid deposition. Although only 7 of 71 (10 %)
biopsy samples of osteosarcoma represented on the tissue microarray were positive
for p63, 7 of 21 (33 %) osteosarcomas were positive when whole tissue sections
were evaluated. Although p63 is detected in most osteoblastomas, it is also
observed in a significant subset of osteosarcomas, severely limiting its utility 
in distinguishing between benign and malignant osteoblastic tumors. The
relatively low prevalence of p63 expression in osteosarcoma would also seem to
preclude its use as a marker of osteoblastic differentiation in skeletal
sarcomas.

Canalicular adenoma is an uncommon benign tumour that generally arises in the
minor salivary glands of individuals over 60 years old. This study illustrates a 
case of canalicular adenoma in a 70-year-old female, presenting as two distinct
asymptomatic nodules in the upper lip. Immunohistochemistry analysis was
performed. Clinical features, management, histology and immunoprofile from this
case and from the literature are discussed.

The differentiation of intraductal papilloma (IDP) in the breast from ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes difficult. Fifty papillary lesions (25 DCIS
and 25 IDP) were immunohistochemically examined using a panel of antibodies,
including CK5/6, ER, p63, Ki-67, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, neuron specific
enolase, CD56, MUC1, MUC3, CD44, p21, p27, and p53. The immunohistochemical
staining pattern of each antibody was evaluated using the Allred scoring system. 
Then, the area under curve (AUC) for each antibody was computed by receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. DCIS typically showed high scores for ER
and MUC3 reactivity compared with IDP, and the AUC for ER and MUC3 were 0.941 and
0.908, respectively. In contrast, IDP showed high scores for CK5/6 and p63
reactivity compared with DCIS, and the AUC for CK5/6 and p63 were 1.00 and 0.954,
respectively. We devised a 'Differential Index' (DI) using the following formula:
[S(ER) + S(MUC3)]/[S(CK5/6) + S(p63) + 1]. The distributions of the DI for IDP
and DCIS did not overlap when the cutoff value was placed arbitrarily at DI =
1.0. From these results, it is concluded that a panel of four CK5/6, ER, p63, and
MUC3 antibodies provide valuable information for differentiating IDP from DCIS.

Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant
form of ectodermal dysplasia due to TP63 mutations. ADULT syndrome is much less
common than the more classical forms of TP63-associated ectodermal dysplasias,
such as ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome and
ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome. ADULT syndrome is
characterized by ectrodactyly, syndactyly, and excessive freckling, in addition
to more typical ectodermal defects, including hypodontia, lacrimal duct
anomalies, hypotrichosis, and onychodysplasia. Unlike some of the other
TP63-associated ectodermal dysplasias, ADULT syndrome lacks clefting and
ankyloblepharon. Here, we report a three-generation family with ADULT syndrome
due to an R243W mutation in TP63, a mutation that has previously been described
in one patient with ADULT syndrome and eight unrelated patients with EEC
syndrome.

The histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) determines treatment
strategies and the need for genetic analyses. Since most NSCLC are diagnosed on
small biopsy or cytologic specimens, an accurate but tissue-sparing approach is
necessary. To date, consensus for a general diagnostic algorithm is lacking. To
test the diagnostic and clinical relevance of the recently published
multidisciplinary guidelines by the International Association for the Study of
Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society, we
examined 371 surgically resected NSCLCs brought into tissue microarray format.
The antibody panel thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), p63, cytokeratin
(CK)5/6, and CK7 is diagnostic for most cases (>94%). Faint/focal staining for
CK7 is negligible for classificatory purposes. Grading adenocarcinomas according 
to histologic architecture is prognostically significant (median overall survival
for well/moderate differentiation, 72.5 months; for poor differentiation, 38.5
months; P = .019). Double stains combining the aforementioned nuclear and
membranous markers are highly diagnostic for NSCLC, conserving tumor tissue for
subsequent analyses.

Tumour-derived mutant p53 proteins promote invasion, in part, by enhancing Rab
coupling protein (RCP)-dependent receptor recycling. Here we identified MET as an
RCP-binding protein and showed that mutant p53 promoted MET recycling. Mutant
p53-expressing cells were more sensitive to hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand 
for MET, leading to enhanced MET signalling, invasion and cell scattering that
was dependent on both MET and RCP. In cells expressing the p53 family member
TAp63, inhibition of TAp63 also lead to cell scattering and MET-dependent
invasion. However, in cells that express very low levels of TAp63, the ability of
mutant p53 to promote MET-dependent cell scattering was independent of TAp63.
Taken together, our data show that mutant p53 can enhance MET signalling to
promote cell scattering and invasion through both TAp63-dependent and
-independent mechanisms. MET has a predominant role in metastatic progression and
the identification of mechanisms through which mutations in p53 can drive MET
signalling may help to identify and direct therapy.

A half-site of the p53-binding site on the keratin 14 promoter is specifically
activated by p63.

Three members of p53 family, p53, p63 and p73, can transactivate their specific
target genes through a p53 consensus sequence-binding motif which consists with
direct repeats of PuPuPuC(T/A)(T/A)GPyPyPy as a whole-site of p53-binding site.
p63, an epidermal stem cells marker, can regulate epidermal development and
differentiation, but p53 has no similar biological activity. One isoform of p63, 
TAp63a, can active an epidermal basal cell marker, keratin 14. However, the
p53-binding site does not exist as a whole-site in the K14 promoter region,
although it contains three putative p53 half-binding sites at -269 to -1 of the
K14 promoter. Two of three putative half-sites of the p53-binding site can be
bound by p63a by electrophoresis mobility shift assay and DNA affinity
purification assay. Only mutation of the p53 half-binding site at -140 to -131,
the TAp63a induced K14 promoter activity can be abolished. This half-site was
specifically activated by p63, but not by p53. Once we extend this p53 half-site 
to a whole p53-binding site in K14 promoter, both p53 and p63 expression vectors 
can activate its activity. Therefore, we propose that the different length of
p53-binding site would determinate the gene regulated by different p53 family
proteins.

<U+0394>Np63a is a p63 isoform that is predominantly expressed in the epidermal stem
cells and in cancer. To find the regulatory pathways of <U+0394>Np63a, we assessed
whether <U+0394>Np63a is acetylated and determined the functional implications of
acetylation. First, the hinge region of p63 was shown to be acetylated by PCAF,
similarly to other p53 family members. Second, acetylation synergistically
induced cytoplasmic localization of <U+0394>Np63a. Finally, acetyl-<U+0394>Np63a was induced
during high-density culture, suggesting that acetylation of <U+0394>Np63a may reinforce 
cell cycle arrest upon cell contact. Altogether, these findings suggest that
acetylation of <U+0394>Np63a contributes to the epidermal homeostasis.

EEC (ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting; OMIM 604292) is an autosomal
dominant developmental disorder resulting mainly from pathogenic mutations of the
DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the TP63 gene. In this study, we showed that K193E
mutation in nine affected individuals of a four-generation kindred with a large
degree of phenotypic variability causes four different syndromes or TP63-related 
disorders: EEC, Ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia (EE), isolated ectodermal
dysplasia, and isolated Split Hand/Foot Malformation type 4 (SHFM4).
Genotype-phenotype and DBD structural modeling analysis showed that the
K193-located loop L2-A is associated with R280 through hydrogen bonding
interactions, while R280 mutations also often cause large phenotypic variability 
of EEC and SHFM4. Thus, we speculate that K193 and several other DBD
mutation-associated syndromes may share similar pathogenic mechanisms,
particularly in the case of the same mutation with different phenotypes. Our
study and others also suggest that the phenotypic variability of EEC is
attributed, at least partially, to genetic and/or epigenetic modifiers.

The p63 transcription factor (TP63) is critical in development, growth and
differentiation of stratifying epithelia. This is highlighted by the severity of 
congenital abnormalities caused by TP63 mutations in humans, the dramatic
phenotypes in knockout mice and de-regulation of TP63 expression in neoplasia
altering the tumour suppressive roles of the TP53 family. In order to define the 
normal role played by TP63 and provide the basis for better understanding how
this network is perturbed in disease, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation
combined with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify >7500
high-confidence TP63-binding regions across the entire genome, in primary human
neonatal foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs). Using integrative strategies, we
demonstrate that only a subset of these sites are bound by TP53 in response to
DNA damage. We identify a role for TP63 in transcriptional regulation of multiple
genes genetically linked to cleft palate and identify AP-2alpha (TFAP2A) as a
co-regulator of a subset of these genes. We further demonstrate that AP-2gamma
(TFAP2C) can bind a subset of these regions and that acute depletion of either
TFAP2A or TFAP2C alone is sufficient to reduce terminal differentiation of
organotypic epidermal skin equivalents, indicating overlapping physiological
functions with TP63.

Our findings show that upregulation of a wild-type Trop-2 has a key controlling
role in human cancer growth, and that tumour development is quantitatively driven
by Trop-2 expression levels. However, little is known about the regulation of
expression of the TROP2 gene. Hence, we investigated the TROP2 transcription
control network. TROP2 expression was shown to depend on a highly interconnected 
web of transcription factors: TP63/TP53L, ERG, GRHL1/Get-1 (grainyhead-like
epithelial transactivator), HNF1A/TCF-1 (T-cell factor), SPI1/PU.1, WT (Wilms'
tumour)1, GLIS2, AIRE (autoimmune regulator), FOXM1 (forkhead box M1) and FOXP3, 
with HNF4A as the major network hub. TROP2 upregulation was shown to subsequently
drive the expression and activation of CREB1 (cyclic AMP-responsive-element
binding protein), Jun, NF-<U+03BA>B, Rb, STAT1 and STAT3 through induction of the cyclin
D1 and ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase)/MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)
pathways. Growth-stimulatory signalling through NF-<U+03BA>B, cyclin D1 and ERK was
shown to require an intact Trop-2 cytoplasmic tail. Network hubs and interacting 
partners are co-expressed with Trop-2 in primary human tumours, supporting a role
of this signalling network in cancer growth.

PURPOSE: Cholera toxin and isoproterenol (ß-adrenergic receptor agonist) are
largely used to enhance cell proliferation. The aim of the study was to assess
the effects of cholera toxin and isoproterenol on growth and differentiation of
cells cultured from human superficial limbal explants.
METHODS: Limbal epithelial cells were cultured from superficial limbal explantsin
basal medium either supplemented with cholera toxin or isoproterenol for 3 weeks.
Growth kinetics and morphometry were studied by light and confocal microscopy.
Progenitor and differentiated epithelial cell markers were studied by
immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, Colony Formation Assay, and reverse
transcription and polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Cell proliferation was significantly higher with 0.5 µg/ml (p = 0.049), 
1 µg/ml (p = 0.005), and 2 µg/ml (p = 0.008) isoproterenol whereas, cholera toxin
and 4 µg/ml isoproterenol did not significantly increase cell proliferation.
Multilayered epithelial cell sheets were obtained in all culture conditions.
Addition of isoproterenol resulted in smaller cell size (p < 0.05) 14 days after 
cells were cultured, whereas cholera toxin had no effects. Strong expression of
cytokeratins 3 and 4/5/6/8/10/13/18 and lower expression of cytokeratin 19,
vimentin, and Delta N p63a were observed after 3 weeks of culture with no
significant differences in the percentage of positive cells according to culture 
medium. Colony-forming efficiencies were observed after 2 weeks in all culture
condition but not after 3 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Isoproterenol was more efficient than cholera toxin for enhancing
cell proliferation and resulted in smaller cell size. It appears to be useful and
safe for growing human limbal epithelial progenitors from limbal explants with no
feeders before transplantation to patients with limbal deficiency.

for cancer development.

The basement membrane (BM) is a layer of specialized extracellular matrix that
surrounds normal prostate glands and preserves tissue integrity. Lack or
discontinuity of the BM is a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion into
interstitial spaces, thus favoring metastasis. Therefore, BM maintenance
represents a barrier against cancer development and progression. In the study, we
show that miR-205 participates in a network involving <U+0394>Np63a, which is essential 
for maintenance of the BM in prostate epithelium. At the molecular level, <U+0394>Np63a 
is able to enhance miR-205 transcription by binding to its promoter, whereas the 
microRNA can post-transcriptionally limit the amount of <U+0394>Np63a protein, mostly by
affecting <U+0394>Np63a proteasomal degradation rather than through a canonical
miRNA/target interaction. Functionally, miR-205 is able to control the deposition
of laminin-332 and its receptor integrin-ß4. Hence, pathological loss of miR-205,
as widely observed in prostate cancer, may favor tumorigenesis by creating
discontinuities in the BM. Here we demonstrate that therapeutic replacement of
miR-205 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells can restore BM deposition and 3D
organization into normal-like acinar structures, thus hampering cancer
progression.

Comparison of immunohistochemical staining in breast papillary neoplasms of
cytokeratin 5/6 and p63 in core needle biopsies and surgical excisions.

Korea.

This study investigated the usefulness of immunohistochemical staining for
cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 and p63 for the precise categorization of papillary lesions 
by core needle biopsy (CNB) through correlations of CNB and subsequent surgical
excision results. We retrospectively reviewed 75 cases with both CNB and
subsequent surgical excision showing papillary lesions on immunohistochemistry
for CK5/6 and p63. Histologic and immunohistochemical criteria used to classify
papillary lesions were applied equally to the CNB and surgical excision samples. 
Final diagnostic concordance with clinical significance was noted in 69 (92.0%)
cases. Six cases had diagnostic discrepancies that changed from papilloma with
atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) to papilloma in 1 case, from papilloma with ADH
to papilloma with usual ductal hyperplasia in 3 cases, and from papilloma with
ductal carcinoma in situ to papilloma with ADH in 2 cases. In conclusion,
although the results of CK5/6 and p63 in CNBs of papillary neoplasms were mostly 
representative of the final results for CK5/6 and p63 in subsequent surgical
excisions, excisional biopsy is required for definitive subtyping due to the
heterogeneous nature of papillary lesions and the possibility of overdiagnosis of
papilloma with ductal carcinoma in situ in CNB, resulting in unnecessary
radiation and hormone therapy.

[The two faces of p63, Janus of the p53 gene family].

The TP53 family member TP63 encodes two main isoforms TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 with
distinct, often opposite functions during development and in the adult. <U+0394>Np63 is 
crucial for the formation of the ectodermal derivatives and epidermis, while
TAp63 is essential for heart development. In the adult, <U+0394>Np63 behaves as a cell
survival factor, controlling cell proliferation, adhesion and cell
differentiation. In contrast, TAp63 is a proapoptotic factor that protects
oocytes from genotoxic insults and prevents premature aging of dermal stem cells.
In agreement with these activities, TAp63 is often lost and <U+0394>Np63 overexpressed
in cancer cells. Because of their opposite and competitive effects, p63 isoforms 
could be viewed as Janus two faces. The review focuses on the accumulating data
on the p63 functions and regulation in the last decade.

Proposed megakaryocytic regulon of p53: the genes engaged to control cell cycle
and apoptosis during megakaryocytic differentiation.

During endomitosis, megakaryocytes undergo several rounds of DNA synthesis
without division leading to polyploidization. In primary megakaryocytes and in
the megakaryocytic cell line CHRF, loss or knock-down of p53 enhances cell
cycling and inhibits apoptosis, leading to increased polyploidization. To support
the hypothesis that p53 suppresses megakaryocytic polyploidization, we show that 
stable expression of wild-type p53 in K562 cells (a p53-null cell line)
attenuates the cells' ability to undergo polyploidization during megakaryocytic
differentiation due to diminished DNA synthesis and greater apoptosis. This
suggested that p53's effects during megakaryopoiesis are mediated through cell
cycle- and apoptosis-related target genes, possibly by arresting DNA synthesis
and promoting apoptosis. To identify candidate genes through which p53 mediates
these effects, gene expression was compared between p53 knock-down (p53-KD) and
control CHRF cells induced to undergo terminal megakaryocytic differentiation
using microarray analysis. Among substantially downregulated p53 targets in
p53-KD megakaryocytes were cell cycle regulators CDKN1A (p21) and PLK2,
proapoptotic FAS, TNFRSF10B, CASP8, NOTCH1, TP53INP1, TP53I3, DRAM1, ZMAT3 and
PHLDA3, DNA-damage-related RRM2B and SESN1, and actin component ACTA2, while
antiapoptotic CKS1B, BCL2, GTSE1, and p53 family member TP63 were upregulated in 
p53-KD cells. Additionally, a number of cell cycle-related, proapoptotic, and
cytoskeleton-related genes with known functions in megakaryocytes but not known
to carry p53-responsive elements were differentially expressed between p53-KD and
control CHRF cells. Our data support a model whereby p53 expression during
megakaryopoiesis serves to control polyploidization and the transition from
endomitosis to apoptosis by impeding cell cycling and promoting apoptosis.
Furthermore, we identify a putative p53 regulon that is proposed to orchestrate
these effects.

The ability to induce apoptosis is the most important tumor-suppression function 
of p53. Inhibitory member of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 family (iASPP) 
is an apoptotic-specific regulator of p53. iASPP suppresses apoptosis by
inhibiting the transactivation function of p53 on the promoters of proapoptotic
genes; however, the mechanism whereby iASPP influences apoptosis in tumor cells
with mutant or deficient p53 has not been completely defined. In this study, we
investigated the role of iASPP in the p63/p73 apoptosis pathway. iASPP inhibited 
apoptosis independently of p53 in tumor cells, mainly by inhibiting the
transcriptional activity of p63/p73 on the promoters of proapoptotic genes.
Because p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers, inhibiting the
expression of endogenous iASPP may provide a useful strategy for restoring the
apoptotic activity of p63 and p73 in human tumors with p53 loss or mutation.
These results represent a promising new strategy for the treatment of cancers
with non-wild-type p53.

China.

PURPOSE: The perivascular localization of stem cell (SC) niches suggests the
presence of a vascular niche. We aimed to determine the angiogenesis potential of
limbal niche cells (NCs).
METHODS: Human limbal NCs were isolated and serially passaged on plastic or
coated Matrigel in embryonic SC medium containing BFGF and leukemia inhibitory
factor before being reseeded in 3D Matrigel. Expression of angiogenesis markers
was assessed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. Their angiogenesis
potential was measured by differentiation into vascular endothelial cells and by 
supporting vascular tube network formed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) on Matrigel. Their support of limbal epithelial progenitor cells (LEPC)
was examined in sphere growth formed by reunion in 3D Matrigel.
RESULTS: On plastic, limbal NC could be cultured only up to four passages before 
turning into myofibroblasts. In contrast, on coated Matrigel, they could be
expanded for up to 12 passages with upregulation of markers suggestive of
angiogenesis progenitors when reseeded in 3D Matrigel because they could
differentiate into vascular endothelial cells and pericytes stabilizing the tube 
network formed by HUVEC. Although both expanded limbal NCs and HUVEC rejoined
with LEPC to form spheres to upregulate expression of <U+0394>Np63a, CK15, and CEBPd,
the former but not the latter abolished expression of CK12 keratin.
CONCLUSIONS: Human limbal NCs continuously expanded on the basement membrane
differentiate into angiogenesis progenitors that prevent differentiation of
LEPC/SCs. They may partake in formation of the vascular niche and contribute to
angiogenesis during wound healing.

Detection of human papillomavirus in small cell carcinomas of the anus and
rectum.

Small cell carcinomas represent <1% of colorectal/anal carcinomas and have a poor
prognosis. Anorectal squamous cell carcinomas are often associated with high-risk
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, similar to squamous and small cell
carcinomas of the uterine cervix. In HPV infection, the oncoprotein E7
inactivates the tumor suppressor Rb, leading to p16 upregulation; however, in
small cell carcinomas, the Rb pathway is often blocked by other mechanisms; thus,
increased p16 may not indicate HPV infection. P16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) may 
have a limited role in evaluating small cell carcinomas for HPV infection.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of previously diagnosed small
cell carcinomas of the anus (n=5) and rectum (n=11) were subjected to IHC for
p16, CDX2, and p63, followed by in situ hybridization for high-risk HPV. All
(100%) cases of anal and rectal small cell carcinomas were positive for p16, and 
100% of anal and 82% of rectal small cell carcinomas were positive for high-risk 
HPV. The majority of cases showed low or very low HPV copy numbers. In 6 cases,
HPV was detected only by using the HPV-16 genotype-specific assay detecting very 
low copy numbers (1 to 2 viral copies). The majority of tumors expressed p63,
which was more pronounced in the anal tumors. CDX2 expression was observed
predominantly in rectal tumors. High-risk HPV can be detected using in situ
hybridization in the majority of anorectal small cell carcinomas, which are
uniformly p16 positive by IHC. HPV-targeted therapy could result in better
control of these aggressive neoplasms.

Differential regulation of cutaneous oncoprotein HPVE6 by wtp53, mutant p53R248W 
and <U+0394>Np63a is HPV type dependent.

UV exposure and p53 mutations are major factors in non-melanoma skin cancer,
whereas a role for HPV infections has not been defined. Previous data
demonstrated the wtp53-mediated degradation of cutaneous HPV20E6 by caspase-3.
<U+0394>Np63a and hot-spot mutant p53R248W conveyed a protective effect on HPV20E6 under
these conditions. We demonstrate a differential regulation by wtp53 of the E6
genes of cutaneous types HPV4, HPV5, HPV7, HPV27, HPV38, HPV48, HPV60 and HPV77. 
Caspase- or proteasome-mediated down-regulation was HPV type dependent. Mutant
p53R248W up-regulated expression of all these E6 proteins as did <U+0394>Np63a except
for HPV38E6 which was down-regulated by the latter. None of these cellular
proteins affected HPV41E6 expression. Ectopic expression of both mutp53R248W and 
<U+0394>Np63a in the normal NIKS keratinocyte cell line harbouring endogenous p53 and
p63however led to a down-regulation of HPV20E6. We demonstrate that HPV20E6
expression in these cells is modulated by additional, yet unidentified, cellular 
protein(s), which are not necessarily involved in apoptosis or autophagy. We
further demonstrate proliferation of HPV20E6-expressing keratinocytes. Levels of 
proteins involved in cell cycle control, cyclin-D1, cdk6 and p16(INK4a),
phosphorylated pRB, as well as c-Jun and p-c-Jun, were all increased in these
cells. HPV20E6 did not compete for the interaction between p16(INK4a) with
cyclin-D1 or cdk6. Phosphorylation of pRB in the HPV20E6 expressing cells seems
to be sufficient to override the cytokenetic block induced by the p16(INK4a)/pRB 
pathway. The present study demonstrates the diverse influence of p53 family
members on individual cutaneous HPVE6 proteins. HPV20E6 expression also resulted 
in varying protein levels of factors involved in proliferation and
differentiation.

The nasolabial cyst is a rare, usually unilateral lesion arising in the soft
tissues adjacent to the alveolar process of the anterior maxilla, above the
apices of frontal teeth and below the alar base. The typical clinical features of
nasolabial cysts are: swelling between the upper lip and nasal aperture caused by
a smooth and fluctuant, well defined space-occupying lesion, elevation of the
nasal ala and obliteration of the nasolabial fold. This report describes some
clinical, radiological and morphological findings in a nasolabial cyst. The cyst 
was lined up with bilayered epithelium showing scattered goblet cells. The
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the basaloid epithelial cells
exhibited nuclear positive reactions for p63. The proliferative activity of the
epithelial cells was low (<5%). Reaction for podoplanin was only discretely
positive in basal cells within the non-inflamed portions but was enhanced in
areas with inflammatory changes of the cyst wall. Cytokeratin subtyping showed a 
distinct expression of intermediate filaments in the nasolabial cyst. Nasolabial 
cysts are developmental cysts that can be cured by adequate surgical techniques. 
The expression pattern of podoplanin in this entity points to an association of
this protein expression with inflammatory reactions to the cyst.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D together stimulate

Bone formation and remodeling require generation of osteoprogenitors from bone
marrow stem cells (MSC), which are regulated by growth factors and hormones, with
putative roles in mesenchymal cell differentiation. Hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) is a pleiotropic growth factor, and together with its high affinity
receptor cMet are widely expressed in normal tissues. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
(1,25OHD) is the most active metabolite of vitamin D; produced mainly in the
kidney, but also by osteoblasts. We previously reported that HGF and 1,25OHD act 
together to increase osteogenic differentiation of human MSC (hMSC) potentially
through increasing p53. Although p53 does not induce the vitamin D receptor
(VDR), p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors has been reported
to up-regulate VDR expression in some tumor cell lines, and thus might play a
part in HGF-regulated VDR expression. Our hypothesis is that the combination of
HGF and 1,25OHD can induce hMSC differentiation by up-regulation of 1,25OHD
and/or VDR expression to increase cell response(s) to 1,25OHD. Using real-time
RT-qPCR, Western blots, luciferase reporter assays, and siRNAs, as well as
antibodies to specific signaling molecules we showed that HGF induced VDR gene
expression, as well as up-regulated p63 gene expression. p63 gene knockdown by
siRNA eliminated the effects of HGF on VDR gene expression as measured by
RT-qPCR, Western blots and luciferase reporter assay, and downstream on
osteogenic differentiation markers, including alkaline phosphatase staining.
Differentiation is a coordinated process of cell cycle exit and tissue-specific
gene expression. These results suggest HGF might be a good candidate to
coordinate the regulation of these two processes during hMSC osteogenic
differentiation. p63 could be a key connecting molecule on the pathway of
HGF-induced VDR expression. Understanding the role of these factors and their
actions could have important clinical implications for the use of hMSC in the
development of novel stem cell therapies.

The promoter of the telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) is subject to tight
regulation and remains repressed in somatic cells to ensure their limited life
span and to prevent tumor initiation. Here we report that the hTERT promoter is
strongly repressed by p53 and the related family members p63 and p73. We found
that p53-mediated repression was different in human and mouse cells and occurred 
through p53-dependent transcription inhibition of c-Myc or through E-box/E2F
pathways, respectively. Although p63TAa-mediated repression occurred through SP1,
p63TAy-mediated repression occurred through E2F signaling. Finally, p73a- and
p73ß-mediated repression occurred through NF-YB2. Our results show a complex
multifactorial mechanism used by p53 and its family members to keep hTERT
expression under tight control.

Recently, the landscape of single base mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) was described. Here we report the discovery of a gene fusion between
TBL1XR1 and TP63, the only recurrent somatic novel gene fusion identified in our 
analysis of transcriptome data from 96 DLBCL cases. Based on this cohort and a
further 157 DLBCL cases analyzed by FISH, the incidence in de novo germinal
center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL is 5% (6 of 115). The fusion appears exclusive to 
GCB and was not seen in 138 non-GCB cases examined (P = .008, Fisher exact test) 
but was present at low incidence in follicular lymphoma (1 of 81). In all 7 cases
identified, the 3' end of the fusion consists of exons 4 and onwards of TP63. The
recurrence, subtype enrichment, and the remarkably conserved nature of the TP63
portion of the fusion suggest an important functional role in the lymphomas that 
harbor this event.

Nephrogenic adenoma (NA) has been considered as a metaplastic process of the
urothelium. It has been suggested that this lesion is of renal tubular cell
origin or differentiation. Immunohistochemical studies of NA emphasize its
staining with a-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR), and prostatic
adenocarcinoma may be a possible differential diagnosis. This reactivity was
recently discussed as an artifact due to endogenous biotin. Kidney-specific
cadherin (Ksp-cad) is a marker of distal nephron. CD10 and KIT are also expressed
in the kidney. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of AMACR, p63,
Ksp-cad, CD10, and KIT in 9 cases of NA (forming a total of 12 lesions).
Practically all of the lesions stained for AMACR with 2 different antibodies and 
2 high-sensitivity (multimer or polymer based) biotin-free methods (83% and
100%). The staining was similar for both methods in 9 of these 12 lesions. All of
the NAs were negative for p63 and KIT, except 1 case, with focal reactivity for
KIT. CD10 was expressed very focally in 4 of the 12 lesions (33%). We observed
weak staining for Ksp-cad in 6 lesions (50%) and 3 (25%) showed a moderate
positivity in 15% to 50% of the cells. In conclusion, positivity of NA for AMACR 
is not an artifact, as we confirmed using 2 different methods. Besides, p63, a
basal cell marker, is usually negative. Immunoreactivity for Ksp-cad seems to
support the differentiation of NA to distal nephron cells, at least in some of
the cases. Other markers expressed by the nephron, such as CD10 and KIT, are
usually negative in NA.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of p63 expression and its
implication in secretory carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemical staining
for p63, p53, MDM2, and smooth muscle actin was performed in 7 cases of secretory
carcinomas. Nuclear expression of p63 was observed in 3 cases, whereas staining
against cytoplasmic and intraluminal secretory material were observed in 4 cases.
p53 was expressed in 3 cases and MDM2 in 2 cases. The loss of myoepithelial cells
was confirmed by immunohistochemical stain for smooth muscle actin in invasive
secretory carcinomas. The pattern of expression of p63 in secretory carcinoma of 
the breast was revealed in nuclei or cytoplasm/secretory materials.

<U+0394>Np63a mediates proliferation and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells by the 
regulation of GATA-6.

The oncogenic isoform of the p63 protein, <U+0394>Np63a, has been found to be
overexpressed in numerous human squamous cell carcinomas. However, the role of
<U+0394>Np63a in human gastric cancer remains unknown. To evaluate this role, we
screened a panel of gastric cancer cell lines for <U+0394>Np63a expression and found
that they are correlated with the differentiation status of the cell lines. Using
the MKN28 gastric cancer cell line for loss-of-function or gain-of-function of
<U+0394>Np63a in our experiments, we observed that forced expression of <U+0394>Np63a promoted 
cell proliferation as assessed by the MTT and colony formation assays, and
increased the GATA-6 expression. In contrast, down-regulation of <U+0394>Np63a via small
interfering RNA suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and
reduced the expression of GATA-6. In conclusion, our data suggest that <U+0394>Np63a
plays an important role in cell growth and proliferation of gastric cancer cells,
which may be associated with the regulation of GATA-6 expression. This is the
first study exploring the biological functions and the underlying mechanism of
<U+0394>Np63a during gastric cancer development. It also identifies potential targets
for anti-tumor treatment.

The prognostic significance of p63 and Ki-67 expression in myoepithelial
carcinoma.

Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022,

BACKGROUND: Myoepithelial carcinoma is a rare tumour. The clinical and biological
behaviours of these tumours are variable. Although many factors have been
evaluated as potential prognostic indicators, including clinical stage, site and 
size of the tumour, high proliferative activity, extensive invasion into the
surrounding tissue, perineural permeation, the abnormal presence of nuclear DNA
content, and marked cellular pleomorphism, there are no definite histological
features that clearly correlate with their behaviour. Thus, conclusions regarding
prognostic factors and ideal treatment may emerge as the number of investigated
myoepithelial carcinoma cases accumulate.
METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, expression levels of p63 and Ki-67 were
determined in 16 myoepithelial carcinoma samples and correlated with
clinicopathological characteristics and patient prognosis.
RESULTS: p63 expression was detected in six of the myoepithelial carcinoma
tissues (37.5%) and Ki-67 was detected in five (31.3%). In addition, p63 and
Ki-67 expression levels were associated with myoepithelial carcinoma recurrence
and metastasis. All six patients with p63-positive expression died due to disease
or cardiovascular disease (mean survival time = 50.5 months), and p63 expression 
was statistically significant with respect to survival (P = 0.01). Four patients 
with Ki-67-positive expression died due to disease or cardiovascular disease
(mean survival time = 44.0 months); however, there was no statistically
significant difference between Ki-67 expression and survival (P = 0.24).
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and metastasis in myoepithelial carcinomas are more
frequent in p63-positive and Ki-67-positive EMCs, and poor prognosis is
associated with overexpression of p63.

Immunohistochemical staining characteristics of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma
of the breast.

Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.

BACKGROUND: Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC) is an uncommon variant of
metaplastic carcinomas of the breast. The immunohistochemical profile of this
entity has not been well characterized and is likely because of its seemingly
inconsistent staining patterns when commonly used immunohistochemical stains are 
employed. We set out to further elucidate the immunohistochemical profile of this
uncommon entity in a sizable cohort of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty cases of LGASC were identified in our files.
Commonly used immunohistochemical stains such as myoepithelial and cytokeratin
markers used to evaluate a small glandular proliferation in the breast (the
differential diagnosis of which includes LGASC) were utilized. The pattern and
location of immunoreactivity were recorded in each case. Results were compared
for staining trends.
RESULTS: All cases of LGASC demonstrated variable staining in both lesional
glands and stromal cells for myoepithelial (p63, smooth muscle myosin, smooth
muscle actin, CD10, calponin) and cytokeratin (CK AE1/3, CK5/6, CK7, CK 34ßE12,
Cam 5.2) markers. Within a single case, circumferential staining using
myoepithelial markers was complete, discontinuous, and absent in over a third of 
the studied cases. A minority of cases showed either complete circumferential
staining (or complete absence) by any single immunohistochemical stain. Lamellar 
staining of stromal cells surrounding glands was best highlighted using smooth
muscle myosin heavy chain or calponin. Using cytokeratin stains, core staining
(luminal glandular cells demonstrating distinctly stronger staining intensity
than the basally located cells in the same gland) was observed in approximately
half of the studied cases. These lesional stromal cells were negative for all
cytokeratins, with the exception of 1, which was focally positive for 1
cytokeratin immunostain (CK7) while being negative for 3 others.
CONCLUSIONS: LGASC consistently stains in an inconsistent manner using commonly
used immunohistochemical stains. In addition, we found lamellar staining and core
staining using myoepithelial and cytokeratin stains, respectively, to be
distinctive and therefore diagnostically valuable.

PURPOSE: p63 plays an important role in several intracellular processes such as
transcription activation and apoptosis. p63 has two N-terminal isoforms, TAp63
and <U+0394>Np63. TAp63 isoform has p53-like functions, while <U+0394>Np63 acts as a dominant
negative inhibitor of the p53 family and is considered oncogenic. Although p63
and its isoforms are overexpressed in a wide variety of human malignancies such
as cervical, head and neck, and lung cancer, their role in endometrial carcinoma 
has not been investigated.
METHODS: We measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction the mRNA
expression of TAp63 and <U+0394>Np63 in a series of 20 endometrioid adenocarcinomas
paired with adjacent normal tissue.
RESULTS: TAp63 isoform exhibited 1.8-fold overexpression in malignant samples,
while <U+0394>Np63 was 4.3-fold overexpressed in cancer specimens. Further analysis
revealed that the <U+0394>N/TA isoform ratio shifted from 0.5 in normal samples to 1.2
in tumor specimens. Statistical analysis also revealed an association of TAp63
expression with high body mass index (p = 0.034), late menopause (p = 0.020), and
lower tumor grade (p = 0.034). <U+0394>Np63 was also correlated with grade I/II tumors
(p = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that both p63 isoforms and especially <U+0394>Np63
play an important role in the development and progression of grade I/II
endometrial adenocarcinoma, especially in obese and late-menopause women.

Irvine, CA, USA.

Laminin 332 (LN332) is a basally expressed extracellular matrix protein that
enhances the migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells. The goal of this
study was to examine LN332 expression breast carcinoma. Triple negative breast
carcinomas lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) expression and
HER2 positivity. Immunohistochemistry for ER, PR, HER2, and dual silver in situ
hybridization for the HER2 gene were used to define the phenotype of 243 breast
cancers in biopsies or arrays. Immunohistochemistry for LN332 revealed that 70%
of triple negative carcinomas stained for LN332. Cytokeratins 5/6 (CK5/6),
epidermal growth factor receptor and p63 alone stained fewer triple negative
breast carcinomas each, but the combination of LN332 and CK5/6 or epidermal
growth factor receptor identified 92% of triple negative breast carcinoma. Of the
163 non-triple negative cases, LN332 was expressed in only 15%. The
identification of LN332 in triple negative breast carcinomas is consistent with
gene profiling studies showing its expression among breast carcinomas with a
basal phenotype. The observation that a proinvasive protein such as LN332 is
expressed in breast cancer suggests another mechanism by which the triple
negative phenotype could be aggressive.

Notch and the p53 clan of transcription factors.

Roemer K(1).

Author information: 
(1)University of Saarland Medical School, Homburg, Germany. klaus.roemer@uks.eu

Notch 1 to 4 and the p53 clan, comprising p53, p63 and p73 plus numerous isoforms
thereof, are gene transcription regulators that are critically involved in
various aspects of cell differentiation, stem cell maintenance and tumour
suppression. It is thus perhaps no surprise that extensive crosstalk between the 
Notch and p53 pathways is implemented during these processes. Typically, Notch
together with p53 and even more so with transactivation competent p63 or p73,
drives differentiation, whereas Notch combined with transactivation impaired p63 
or p73 helps maintain undifferentiated stem cell compartments. With regard to
cancer, it seems that Notch acts as a tumour suppressor in cellular contexts
where Notch signalling supports p53 activation and both together can bring on its
way an anti-proliferative programme of differentiation, senescence or apoptosis. 
In contrast, Notch often acts as an oncoprotein in contexts where it suppresses
p53 activation and activity and where differentiation is unwanted. It is no
accident that the latter pathways-the inhibition by Notch of p53 and
differentiation-are operative in somatic stem cells as well as in tumour cells.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of subjects from Japan and South
Korea reported a novel association between the TP63 locus on chromosome 3q28 and 
risk of lung adenocarcinoma (p = 7.3 × 10(-12)); however, this association did
not achieve genome-wide significance (p = 10(-7)) among never-smoking males or
females. To determine if this association with lung cancer risk is independent of
tobacco use, we genotyped the TP63 SNPs reported by the previous GWAS (rs10937405
and rs4488809) in 3,467 never-smoking female lung cancer cases and 3,787
never-smoking female controls from 10 studies conducted in Taiwan, Mainland
China, South Korea, and Singapore. Genetic variation in rs10937405 was associated
with risk of lung adenocarcinoma [n = 2,529 cases; p = 7.1 × 10(-8); allelic risk
= 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.87]. There was also evidence of
association with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (n = 302 cases; p = 0.037;
allelic risk = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.67-0.99). Our findings provide strong evidence
that genetic variation in TP63 is associated with the risk of lung adenocarcinoma
among Asian females in the absence of tobacco smoking.

Distinguishing between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is
becoming increasingly important, given the different treatment regimens
available. Although histologic subdivision between the two is generally not
difficult in differentiated tumors, it can be challenging in poorly
differentiated tumors and may require a panel of immunohistochemistry stains. The
p63 gene encodes two different N-termini (TA and <U+0394>N). <U+0394>Np63 is selectively
expressed in squamous cell carcinoma, whereas TAp63 is not restricted only to it.
4A4, a widely used anti-p63 antibody, identifies both isoforms and is expressed
in about 15% of adenocarcinomas, and, although generally focal, its expression
can be diffuse. In this study, a total of 150 lung adenocarcinomas and 50
squamous cell carcinomas were immunostained by antibodies for p63 (4A4), <U+0394>Np63
(p40), and TTF-1 (8G7G3/1). Twenty-seven adenocarcinomas (18%) were positive for 
p63 to a variable extent, with diffuse reaction being seen in 13 tumors (8.7%).
p63 expression was seen in all subtypes of adenocarcinomas, except for the
mucinous type. p40 was negative in all adenocarcinomas. All squamous cell
carcinomas were diffusely positive for both p63 and p40. Four of 27 p63-positive 
adenocarcinomas were negative for TTF-1. p63 expression is not uncommonly seen in
adenocarcinomas, whereas <U+0394>Np63 (p40) expression is specific for squamous cell
carcinoma, with sensitivity comparable to that of p63 expression. Presence of
p63-positive cells in poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma may be
erroneously interpreted as evidence of squamous cell differentiation. p40 appears
to be a more reliable marker for squamous cell carcinoma.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish a relationship between hypoxic
stress and the expression of <U+0394>Np63a in an established rabbit contact lens model
and in cultured corneal epithelial cells.
METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were fit in one eye with either a non-oxygen
transmissible or hyper-oxygen-permeable rigid contact lens for 24 hrs of wear;
the contralateral eye was used as a control. All the rabbits underwent a
bilateral nictitating membranectomy to facilitate lens retention. <U+0394>Np63a
expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blot.
Telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (hTCEpi) were grown in
serum-free media and treated with the hypoxia-mimetic cobalt chloride to simulate
hypoxia for 6 hrs (short term) or 24 hrs (prolonged). Transcriptional activity
and protein levels were assessed using luciferase reporter assays, reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. Cell viability was
assessed by live/dead assay.
RESULTS: Compared with the non-lens wearing eye, 24 hrs of non-oxygen
transmissible lens wear in vivo decreased <U+0394>Np63a protein levels in both the
limbal and central corneal epithelium; this decrease was not found in the
hyper-oxygen transmissible lens group. In hTCEpi cells in vitro, hypoxia
increased the activity of the <U+0394>N promoter but reduced the levels of <U+0394>Np63a mRNA
after 24 hrs of prolonged culture. Similarly, <U+0394>Np63a expression levels were
unaffected from short-term exposure but decreased after 24 hrs. Live/dead assay
confirmed the presence of viable cells after CoCl2 treatment at 6- and 24-hr time
points. Cells treated for 24 hrs were viable but were smaller and rounded with
signs of membrane blebbing, consistent with early stages of apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic stress induced by either prolonged wear of a nonoxygen
transmissible lens in vivo or hypoxic-mimic conditions by cobalt chloride in
vitro downregulates <U+0394>Np63a in the corneal epithelium. The loss of <U+0394>Np63a in
response to hypoxic stress may contribute to the disruption of normal renewal
mechanisms reported with low oxygen transmissible contact lens wear and prolonged
eyelid closure.

Antimitotics such as taxanes are being considered as alternatives to conventional
cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with bladder cancer, but the molecular
determinants of sensitivity or resistance to these agents in bladder cancer cells
have not been defined. Here we examined the cytotoxic effects of a novel
antimitotic, the Eg5 inhibitor AZD4877, in a molecularly diverse panel of human
bladder cancer cell lines. The cells displayed heterogeneous responses to the
drug that correlated closely with sensitivity to docetaxel but not with
sensitivity to cisplatin. Global gene expression profiling identified p63 as the 
top gene that was differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cell
lines. Stable knockdown of p63 inhibited cell death induced by either AZD4877 or 
docetaxel and was associated with decreased proliferation and decreased
expression of c-myc. Furthermore, c-myc knockdown also rendered cells resistant
to AZD4877 or docetaxel. Together, our results implicate p63 and its downstream
target c-myc as determinants of sensitivity to anti-mitotics in bladder cancer
cells. Our data also suggest that anti-mitotics and cisplatin target different
subsets of bladder cancer cells, a conclusion that may have important
implications for the therapy of muscle-invasive bladder cancers.

p53 and p63 are transcription factors -TFs- playing master roles in the
DNA-damage response and in the development and maintenance of pluristratified
epithelia, respectively. p53 mutations are common in epithelial tumors and HaCaT 
keratinocytes harbor two p53 alleles -H179Y and R282Q- with gain-of-function
(GOF) activity. Indeed, functional inactivation of mutp53 affects the growth rate
of HaCaT. We investigated the strategy of mutp53, by performing ChIP-Seq
experiments of mutp53 and p63 and analyzed the transcriptome after mutp53
inactivation. Mutp53 bind to 7135 locations in vivo, with a robust overlap with
p63. De novo motifs discovery recovered a p53/p63RE with high information content
in sites bound by p63 and mutp53/p63, but not by mutp53 alone: these sites are
rather enriched in elements of other TFs. The HaCaT p63 locations are only
partially overlapping with those of normal keratinocytes; importantly, and
enriched in mutp53 sites which delineate a functionally different group of target
genes. Our data favour a model whereby mutp53 GOF mutants act both by tethering
growth-controlling TFs and highjacking p63 to new locations.

BACKGROUND: To analyze a multi-institutional series of type C thymic carcinomas
(TCs) (including neuroendocrine tumors), focusing on the expression and mutations
of c-KIT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of c-KIT/CD117, p63, CD5
and neuroendocrine markers, as well as mutational analysis of c-KIT exons 9, 11, 
13, 14, 17 by direct sequencing of 48 cases of TCs. Immunohistochemical and
molecular data were statistically crossed with clinicopathological features.
RESULTS: Overall, 29 tumors (60%) expressed CD117, 69% were positive for CD5 and 
85% (41 cases) for p63. Neuroendocrine markers stained all six atypical
carcinoids and five poorly-differentiated thymic squamous cell carcinomas.
Overall, six CD117-positive cases (12.5%) showed c-KIT mutation. No mutation was 
detected in CD117-negative tumors and carcinoids. All the mutations were found in
poorly-differentiated thymic squamous cell carcinomas expressing CD117, CD5, p63 
and lacking neuroendocrine markers (6 of 12 cases with these features). Mutations
involved exon 11 (four cases: V559A, L576P, Y553N, W557R), exon 9 (E490K) and
exon 17 (D820E).
CONCLUSIONS: All TCs need an immunohistochemical screening with CD117, while
c-KIT mutation analysis is mandatory only in CD117-positive cases, particularly
when coexpressing CD5 and p63, lacking neuroendocrine differentiation. The
finding of c-KIT mutation can predict efficacy with different c-KIT inhibitors.

and micro-RNA modulation.

Cisplatin was shown to induce the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent
phosphorylation of tumor protein p63 isoform, (<U+0394>Np63a), leading to a
transcriptional regulation of specific genes implicated in the control of cell
death of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. We previously observed that the
cisplatin-induced phosphorylated (p)-<U+0394>Np63a transcriptionally regulates the
expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in SCC cells. We found here that
cisplatin exposure of SCC cells led to modulation of the members of the
autophagic pathway, such as Atg1/Ulk1, Atg3, Atg4A, Atg5, Atg6/Becn1, Atg7, Atg9A
and Atg10, by a direct p-<U+0394>Np63a-dependent transcriptional regulation. We further 
found that specific miRNAs (miR-181a, miR-519a, miR-374a and miR-630), which are 
critical downstream targets of the p-<U+0394>Np63a, modulated the protein levels of
ATG5, ATG6/BECN1, ATG10, ATG12, ATG16L1 and UVRAG, adding another level of
expression control for autophagic pathways in SCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. 
Our data support the notion that the cisplatin-induced p-<U+0394>Np63a could regulate
key pathways implicated in response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.

In patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), transplantation of ex vivo
expanded human limbal epithelial cells (HLECs) can restore the structural and
functional integrity of the corneal surface. However, the protocol for
cultivation and transplantation of HLECs differ significantly, and in most
protocols growth additives such as cholera toxins, exogenous growth factors,
hormones and fetal calf serum are used. In the present article, we compare for
the first time human limbal epithelial cells (HLECs) cultivated on human amniotic
membrane (HAM) in a complex medium (COM) including fetal bovine serum to a medium
with human serum as single growth supplement (HSM), and report on our first
examinations of HLECs expanded in autologous HSM and used for transplant
procedures in patients with LSCD. Expanded HLECs were examined by genome-wide
microarray, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and for cell viability, morphology,
expression of immunohistochemical markers and colony forming efficiency.
Cultivation of HLECs in HSM produced a multilayered epithelium where cells with
markers associated with LESCs were detected in the basal layers. There were few
transcriptional differences and comparable cell viability between cells
cultivated in HSM and COM. The p63 gene associated with LESCs were expressed 3.5 
fold more in HSM compared to COM, and Western blotting confirmed a stronger p63a 
band in HSM cultures. The cornea-specific keratin CK12 was equally found in both 
culture conditions, while there were significantly more CK3 positive cells in
HSM. Cells in epithelial sheets on HAM remaining after transplant surgery of
patients with LSCD expressed central epithelial characteristics, and dissociated 
cells cultured at low density on growth-arrested fibroblasts produced clones
containing 21 ± 12% cells positive for p63a (n = 3). In conclusion, a culture
medium without growth additives derived from animals or from animal cell cultures
and with human serum as single growth supplement may serve as an equivalent
replacement for the commonly used complex medium for ex vivo expansion of HLECs
on HAM.

Rapp-Hodgkin Syndrome (RHS) is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the
TP63 gene encoding p63 transcription factor. p63 is directly associated with a
cis-regulatory element on chromosome 7q21 that controls the expression of DLX5
and DLX6 genes which are involved in craniofacial abnormalities and ectrodactyly 
or split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). Chromosomal deletions on 7q21 locus can
result in loss of DXL5/DLX6 and/or in loss/disruption of cis-regulatory elements,
at which p63 binds. We report two patients that have in common a p63-Dlx5/Dlx6
pathway dysregulation. One showed growth retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism,
syndactyly, developmental delay and a de novo deletion (~8.5Mb) on chromosome
7q21.13-q21.3, including DLX5 and DLX6. The second patient with a clinical
diagnosis of RHS showed a de novo heterozygous missense mutation, c. 401G>A
(p.G134D), in TP63 (exon 4). Our findings may contribute to a greater
understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying disorders caused by TP63
mutations.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic approach and criteria for intraductal
papillary neoplasms of breast.
METHODS: According to the criteria of 2003 WHO classification, 187 cases of
intraductal papillary neoplasm of breast were identified and enrolled into the
study. The clinical and histologic features were reviewed and immunohistochemical
study for CD10, p63, CK14, CK5/6, CK7, MGB1 and p53 were carried out on 53 cases.
RESULTS: Amongst the 187 cases studied, there were 128 cases of intraductal
papilloma, 16 cases of atypical intraductal papilloma and 43 cases of intraductal
papillary carcinoma. They showed a spectrum of morphologic features including
epithelial and stromal hyperplasia and secondary changes. The expression of
myoepithelial markers, including CD10 and p63, significantly decreased in
ascending order from intraductal papillomas, atypical intraductal papillomas and 
intraductal papillary carcinomas (P < 0.001). The expression of basal cell
markers, including CK5/6 and CK14, showed a mosaic pattern in benign lesions and 
significantly decreased or was absent in atypical and carcinomatous lesions (P < 
0.001). In contrast, the luminal cell marker CK7 expressed in the three groups
with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.06). On the other hand, the
expression of MGB1 in intraductal papillary carcinomas was much lower than that
in the other two groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007). The staining for p53 was
negative in all of the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraductal papillary neoplasms of breast represent a heterogeneous 
group of lesions with various morphologic appearances. Correlation with
immunostaining results for myoepithelial markers, basal-type cytokeratins and
luminal epithelial markers are helpful in arriving at a definitive diagnosis.

[Usefulness of CK19, HBME-1 and galectin-3 expressions in differential diagnosis 
of thyroid papillary microcarcinoma from benign lesions].

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the morphological features of thyroid papillary
microcarcinoma (PMC) and assess the significance of expression of CK19, HBME-1,
Galectin-3, CD56 and p63 in differential diagnosis of PMC from benign thyroid
lesions.
METHODS: Clinicopathologic features of 78 cases PMC were reviewed.
Immunohistochemical analysis of CK19, HBME-1, Galectin-3, CD56, and p63 in 78
cases of PMC and 48 cases of benign thyroid lesions (18 cases of papillary
hyperplasia, 17 cases of nodular goiter and 13 cases of lymphocytic thyroiditis) 
was conducted. The patients were followed up for from 6 to 269 months after
surgical operation.
RESULTS: 69 cases nuclear atypia and overlapping nuclei (88.5%), 67 cases nuclear
grooves (85.9%), 50 cases nuclear pseudoinclusions (64.1%) and 60 cases papillary
architecture (76.9%) were detected in 78 cases of PMC. Moderate to strong
co-expression of CK19, HBME-1 and galectin-3 was observed in 98.0% (50/51) in the
PMC group but in none of the benign disease group. The expression of CD56 and p63
was negative in both groups. In the postoperative follow-up period of 6-269
months, 7 cases (9.0%) developed intrathyroid recurrence, 3 cases (3.8%)
developed lymph node metastasis, no distant metastasis or death was observed. In 
12 cases (15.4%) the PMC lesion smaller than 3 mm in diameter was not found by
frozen section diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Overlapping nuclei, nuclear atypia, polar disorder, ground glass
nuclei, nuclear grooves and nuclear pseudoinclusions are most important for the
diagnosis of PMC with or without papillary architecture. The appearance of
definite interstitial invasion, interstitial sclerosis and true complex papillary
architecture are more helpful to make right diagnosis. Intraoperative frozen
section is of limited value for a reliable diagnosis of PMC in diameter < or = 3 
mm. Moderate to strong co-expression of CK19, HBME-1 and Galectin-3 is a very
useful indicator for differential diagnosis of PMC from benign thyroid lesions.

Immunohistochemical pitfalls in prostate pathology.

The diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma relies on a constellation of
architectural, cytological, and immunohistochemical features. Although the
diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is straightforward in most cases, due to
earlier detection of the disease in the modern era, pathologists have become
increasingly challenged in diagnosing small foci of cancer when only a few
atypical glands are present in needle biopsies. Immunohistochemistry has
therefore become an essential tool in the evaluation of such foci to confirm the 
absence of basal cells. In this context, the 2 most commonly used basal cell
markers are anti-keratin 34BE12 and p63. Furthermore, a-methylacyl-CoA racemase, 
a marker found to be overexpressed in the cytoplasm of prostatic adenocarcinoma
glands, is also commonly used in routine practice. Another diagnostic role of
immunohistochemistry is to confirm the prostatic origin of the tumor in the
primary or metastatic setting of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, which may
be confused with nonprostatic carcinomas. We herein review the utility as well as
the limitations of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostatic
adenocarcinoma, and we describe the most important pitfalls in the interpretation
of various immunostains that pathologists should be aware of to minimize
misdiagnoses.

Association between C3orf21, TP63 polymorphisms and environment and NSCLC in
never-smoking Chinese population.

Recently, two genome-wide association studies in Asia identified gene
polymorphisms known as rs4488809, rs9816619 in TP63 and rs2131877, rs952481 in
C3orf21. It has been proposed that these polymorphisms are susceptibility loci
for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development among Japanese and Korean
populations. We ask whether susceptibility to NSCLC is limited to the Chinese
population or whether the environment also affects genetic polymorphisms. We
conducted a matched case-control study to explore this question. Results show
that polymorphism of TP63 was not associated with NSCLC development, whereas
variant genotypes of C3orf21 were nominally associated with a reduced risk of
lung adenocarcinoma (OR=0.619, 95% CI=0.390-0.976). These results strongly
suggest that environmental agents interact with human genetic polymorphism
independent of ethnic background. In addition, the C3orf21 gene may be a
potential susceptibility marker for lung adenocarcinoma independent of ethnic
background and environmental agents.

In this study, we report 2 pediatric cases of nuclear protein of the testis (NUT)
midline carcinoma (NMC) suggestive of pulmonary origin: case 1 was a 14-year-old 
Japanese boy and case 2 was a 7-year-old Japanese girl. Initial symptoms of both 
cases were prolonged cough and chest pain, and the case 2 patient also complained
of lumbago and lumbar mass due to bone metastases. Imaging studies revealed that 
pulmonary tumors from both patients were located at the hilar region of the lower
lobe. Biopsies of the tumors showed undifferentiated carcinoma in case 1 and
combined undifferentiated and squamous cell carcinoma in case 2. Despite
intensive treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, progression of neither tumor
was controlled, and both patients died of the tumors at 1 year (case 1) and 4
months (case 2) after onset of disease. Both tumors were diffusely positive for
p63 and NUT expression and were partially positive for various cytokeratins.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and subsequent direct
sequencing revealed that the bromodomain-containing protein 4-NUT chimeric gene
was present in tumor tissue of both patients, leading to a diagnosis of NMC. The 
tumor cells of case 1 were also positive for thyroid transcription factor-1
expression, but those of case 2 were negative. Histologic examination of the
surgically removed lung tumor of case 1 indicated that the origin of the tumor
was basal cells of the bronchiolar epithelia.

BACKGROUND: Triple antibody cocktail immunohistochemical staining is routinely
used as an ancillary method to establish a diagnosis of prostate cancer in
biopsies with small foci of atypical glands. Crush artefact can distort surgical 
margins in radical prostatectomy specimens, occasionally making it difficult to
diagnose a positive margin.
AIM: To investigate the ability of a cocktail stain to distinguish carcinoma from
benign prostatic glands at the edge of crushed margins in prostatectomy
specimens.
METHODS: 10 radical prostatectomy specimens with crushed benign glands at the
surgical margins, and 20 with crushed margins positive for carcinoma were
retrieved from the pathology archives. The latter included 16 (80%) with positive
apical margins, 2 (10%) incised intraprostatic margins, and 1 (5%) soft tissue
margin. Two-colour triple antibody stain using a cocktail of antibodies against
a-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR), high molecular weight keratin and p63
was performed on all the selected cases.
RESULTS: In 10/10 specimens with crushed benign glands, basal cell staining
continued to be detectable, while AMACR staining was negative in all cases
(0/10). In the positive margin cases, none of the crushed glands expressed basal 
cell marker staining (0/20), whereas 14/20 (70%) of the cases showed variable
levels of AMACR positivity at the inked margin.
CONCLUSION: Two-colour triple antibody cocktail stain is useful in the assessment
of most, but not all, surgical margins with crushed artefact in prostatectomy
specimens by helping to establish whether glands are malignant or benign.

The role of Notch signaling in cervical cancer is seemingly controversial. To
confirm the function of Notch signaling in this type of cancer, we established a 
stable Notch1-activated cervical cancer HeLa cell line. We found that Notch1
activation resulted in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and tumor suppression. At
the molecular level, we found that a variety of genes associated with cyclic AMP,
G protein-coupled receptor, and cancer signaling pathways contributed to
Notch1-mediated tumor suppression. We observed that the expression of
somatostatin (SST) was dramatically induced by Notch1 signaling activation, which
was accompanied by enhanced expression of the cognate SST receptor subtype 1
(SSTR1) and SSTR2. Certain genes, such as tumor protein 63 (TP63, p63), were
upregulated, whereas others, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), Myc, Akt, and
STAT3, were downregulated. Subsequently, knockdown of Notch1-induced SST reversed
Notch1-induced decrease of BCL-2 and increase of p63, indicating that
Notch1-induced tumor suppression may be partly through upregulating SST
signaling. Our findings support a possible crosstalk between Notch signaling and 
SST signaling. Moreover, Notch-induced SSTR activation could enhance
SSTR-targeted cancer chemotherapy. Valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase
inhibitor, suppressed cell growth and upregulated the expression of Notch1 and
SSTR2. A combination therapy with VPA and the SSTR2-targeting cytotoxic conjugate
CPT-SST strongly led to greater suppression, as compared to each alone. Our
findings thus provide us with a promising clinical opportunity for enhanced
cancer therapy using combinations of Notch1-activating agents and SSTR2-targeting
agents.

Prediction of tumor behavior in meningiomas based on morphological features alone
remains difficult. Several immunohistochemical biomarkers have been proposed to
assist conventional methods. However, no single immunohistochemical marker can
unequivocally discriminate between benign and aggressive meningiomas. There is
only 1 study available in the literature that correlates p63 expression with
overall histological grade of the meningioma. The present study is undertaken to 
assess the correlation between p63 expression and histological grade of
meningiomas. For this purpose, the authors studied and analyzed the
immunohistochemical expression of p63 in 85 cases of meningioma, including WHO
grade I (63), grade II (11), and grade III (11) cases. Correlation between
histological grade and nuclear immunoreactivity to p63 antibody was performed.
Furthermore, expression of p63 protein was correlated with short clinical
follow-up and Ki-67 proliferation index. Among 85 patients analyzed, there were
61 women (71.7 %) and 24 men (28.2%) between 7 and 75 years old. Expression of
p63 protein was found in 34.9% of grade I cases, but in grade II and III, 63.6%
of cases each were immunoreactive. Correlation between histological grade and p63
immunoreactivity was significant (P = .02). p63-positive grade I meningiomas did 
not show elevated Ki-67 index. The present study contradicts earlier reports
because there are a considerable number of grade I meningiomas that express p63. 
Although p63 expression is significantly associated with higher histological
grade of meningiomas, it may not be considered as a sole biomarker to assess
aggressive behavior of the tumor.

poorly differentiated urothelial cell carcinoma from high-grade tumours of the
renal collecting system.

AIMS: High-grade, poorly differentiated, infiltrative carcinomas involving the
renal sinus region often pose challenging differential diagnostic considerations,
specifically differentiation of urothelial carcinoma (UC) from renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) subtypes. Accurate classification, especially the distinction of 
UC from RCC, is critical, as therapeutic approaches differ.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Cluster analysis was performed on immunohistochemical data
from 18 invasive UCs, six CDCs, two RMCs, 18 type 2 papillary renal cell
carcinomas (PRCCs) and 20 high-grade clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CRCCs)
using a broad panel of traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers. The
initial analysis with all antibodies segregates almost all the RCCs (45 of 46,
98%) from all the UCs based on the lack of expression of p63 in all (100%) RCCs, 
along with predominant strong expression of paired box gene 8 (PAX8) and
vimentin, predominant lack of expression of high molecular weight cytokeratin
(HMCK) and CK7 and variable expression of RCC, CD10, CA1X and PAX2. All the UCs
cluster together with strong, diffuse reactivity for p63, predominant reactivity 
for CK7 and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), and absent to minimal
staining with PAX8, RCC antigen, PAX2, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR),
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and vimentin. After removing antibodies with
significant overlap and/or minimal impact, a second analysis with a limited panel
including p63, CK7, vimentin, integrase interactor 1 (INI-1) and PAX8 was
performed. Again, the majority of UCs cluster into one group and p63 positivity
separates all UCs from RCCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of INI-1 expression, noted exclusively in RMCs, segregates RMCs
into a separate cluster. PAX8 is rarely positive (17%) in UC, is commonly
expressed in CDC, RMC, PRCC and CRCC and is superior to PAX2.

Role of CD10, wide-spectrum keratin, p63, and podoplanin in the distinction of
epithelioid and spindle cell tumors of the skin: an immunohistochemical study of 
81 cases.

Cutaneous epithelioid and spindle cell neoplasms occasionally pose a significant 
diagnostic challenge on purely histologic grounds. Given the substantial
clinicopathologic overlap between these lesions, especially in small biopsies,
the use of immunohistochemical studies are essential. We evaluated the utility of
a battery of immunohistochemical markers, including podoplanin (D2-40), CD10,
p63, and wide-spectrum cytokeratin, for distinguishing cutaneous epithelioid and 
spindle cell tumors. A total of 81 cases, including 42 atypical fibroxanthoma
(AFX), 13 spindle cell melanoma, 10 sarcomatoid carcinoma, 9 leiomyosarcoma
(LMS), and 7 leiomyoma, formed the basis of our study. Immunohistochemical
results were as follows-AFX: CD10 (35 of 42), p63 (1 of 42), CK (1 of 42), and
podoplanin (19 of 42); spindle cell melanoma: CD10 (7 of 13), p63 (0 of 13), CK
(0 of 13), and podoplanin (2 of 13); sarcomatoid carcinoma: CD10 (5 of 10), p63
(7 of 10), CK (4 of 10), and podoplanin (7 of 10); LMS: CD10 (4 of 9), p63 (0 of 
9), CK (2 of 9), and podoplanin (1 of 9); and leiomyoma: CD10 (0 of 7), p63 (0 of
7), CK (0 of 7), and podoplanin (1 of 7). Our findings showed that the
combination of certain immunohistochemical markers may be a useful adjunct in the
evaluation of epithelioid and spindle cell tumors of the skin. In this study, we 
found that a combination of wide-spectrum cytokeratin and p63 are most helpful in
the distinction of sarcomatoid carcinomas from other tumors; however, there
remains a substantial minority of cases of sarcomatoid carcinoma that will
consistently demonstrate negative staining for these markers. We also found that 
CD10 and podoplanin (D2-40) have limited diagnostic utility in epithelioid and
spindle cell tumors of the skin; however, a strong and diffuse pattern of
staining will favor the diagnosis of AFX. Caution should also be observed in the 
diagnosis of spindle cell malignant melanoma because some cases may express CD10,
p63, and podoplanin while being nonreactive to S100 protein. Awareness of the
limitations of the use of these stains and familiarity with their staining
patterns in spindle and epithelioid cell tumors of the skin are extremely
important because the prognostic and therapeutic implications for such neoplasms 
may be quite different.

BACKGROUND: p63 is a member of the p53 family that has been implicated in
maintenance of epithelial stem cell compartments. Previous studies demonstrated
that p63 is downregulated in muscle-invasive bladder cancers, but the
relationship between p63 expression and survival is not clear.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used real-time PCR to characterize p63
expression and several genes implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in human bladder cancer cell lines (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>15) and primary tumors (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>101).
We correlated tumor marker expression with stage, disease-specific (DSS), and
overall survival (OS). Expression of E-cadherin and p63 correlated directly with 
one another and inversely with expression of the mesenchymal markers Zeb-1,
Zeb-2, and vimentin. Non-muscle-invasive (Ta and T1) bladder cancers uniformly
expressed high levels of E-cadherin and p63 and low levels of the mesenchymal
markers. Interestingly, a subset of muscle-invasive (T2-T4) tumors maintained
high levels of E-cadherin and p63 expression. As expected, there was a strongly
significant correlation between EMT marker expression and muscle invasion
(p<0.0001). However, OS was shorter in patients with muscle-invasive tumors that 
retained p63 (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.007).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data confirm that molecular markers of EMT are
elevated in muscle-invasive bladder cancers, but interestingly, retention of the 
"epithelial" marker p63 in muscle-invasive tumors is associated with a worse
outcome.

Stress-induced NQO1 controls stability of C/EBPa against 20S proteasomal
degradation to regulate p63 expression with implications in protection against
chemical-induced skin cancer.

Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.

Previously, we have shown a role of cytosolic NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1
(NQO1) in the stabilization of p63 against 20S proteasomal degradation resulting 
in thinning of the epithelium and chemical-induced skin cancer (Oncogene (2011)
30, 1098-1107). Current studies have demonstrated that NQO1 control of
CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBPa) against 20S proteasomal degradation also 
contributes to the upregulation of p63 expression and protection. Western and
immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that disruption of the NQO1 gene in mice
and mouse keratinocytes led to degradation of C/EBPa and loss of p63 gene
expression. p63 promoter mutagenesis, transfection and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays identified a C/EBPa-binding site between nucleotide
position -185 and -174 that bound to C/EBPa and upregulated p63 gene expression. 
Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that 20S proteasomes 
directly interacted and degraded C/EBPa. NQO1 direct interaction with C/EBPa led 
to stabilization of C/EBPa against 20S proteasomal degradation. NQO1 protection
of C/EBPa required binding of NADH with NQO1. Exposure of skin and keratinocytes 
to the chemical stress agent benzo(a)pyrene led to induction of NQO1 and
stabilization of C/EBPa protein, resulting in an increase in p63 RNA and protein 
in wild-type but not in NQO1-/- mice. Collectively, the current data combined
with previous data suggest that stress induction of NQO1 through both
stabilization of C/EBPa and increase in p63 and direct stabilization of p63
controls keratinocyte differentiation, leading to protection against
chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis. The studies are significant as 2-4% human
individuals are homozygous and 23% are heterozygous for the NQO1P187S mutation
and might be susceptible to stress-induced skin diseases.

We show that changes in the nucleotide sequence alter the DNA conformation in the
crystal structures of p63 DNA-binding domain (p63DBD) bound to its response
element. The conformation of a 22-bp canonical response element containing an AT 
spacer between the two half-sites is unaltered compared with that containing a TA
spacer, exhibiting superhelical trajectory. In contrast, a GC spacers abolishes
the DNA superhelical trajectory and exhibits less bent DNA, suggesting that
increased GC content accompanies increased double helix rigidity. A 19-bp DNA,
representing an AT-rich response element with overlapping half-sites, maintains
superhelical trajectory and reveals two interacting p63DBD dimers crossing one
another at 120°. p63DBD binding assays to response elements of increasing length 
complement the structural studies. We propose that DNA deformation may affect
promoter activity, that the ability of p63DBD to bind to superhelical DNA
suggests that it is capable of binding to nucleosomes, and that overlapping
response elements may provide a mechanism to distinguish between p63 and p53
promoters.

PURPOSE: The involvement of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the
process of corneal wound healing remains largely unclear. The purpose of the
present study was to gain insight into Slug expression and corneal wound healing.
METHODS: Slug expression during wound healing in the murine cornea was evaluated 
using fluorescence staining in vivo. Slug or Snail was stably introduced into
human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). These stable transfectants were evaluated
for the induction of the EMT, cellular growth, migration activity, and expression
changes in differentiation-related molecules.
RESULTS: Slug, but not Snail, was clearly expressed in the nuclei of corneal
epithelial cells in basal lesion of the corneal epithelium during wound healing
in vivo. The overexpression of Slug or Snail induced an EMT-like cellular
morphology and cadherin switching in HCECs, indicating that these transcription
factors were able to mediate the typical EMT in HCECs. The overexpression of Slug
or Snail suppressed cellular proliferation but enhanced the migration activity.
Furthermore, ABCG2, TP63, and keratin 19, which are known as stemness-related
molecules, were downregulated in these transfectants.
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that Slug is upregulated during corneal wound healing
in vivo. The overexpression of Slug mediated a change in the cellular phenotype
affecting proliferation, migration, and expression levels of
differentiation-related molecules. This is the first evidence that Slug is
regulated during the process of corneal wound healing in the corneal epithelium
in vivo, providing a novel insight into the EMT and Slug expression in corneal
wound healing.

Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome, which is
characterized by cleft palate and severe defects of the skin, is an autosomal
dominant disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding transcription factor
p63. Here, we report the generation of a knock-in mouse model for AEC syndrome
(p63(+/L514F) ) that recapitulates the human disorder. The AEC mutation exerts a 
selective dominant-negative function on wild-type p63 by affecting progenitor
cell expansion during ectodermal development leading to a defective epidermal
stem cell compartment. These phenotypes are associated with impairment of
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling resulting from reduced expression of
Fgfr2 and Fgfr3, direct p63 target genes. In parallel, a defective stem cell
compartment is observed in humans affected by AEC syndrome and in Fgfr2b(-/-)
mice. Restoring Fgfr2b expression in p63(+/L514F) epithelial cells by treatment
with FGF7 reactivates downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and 
cell proliferation. These findings establish a functional link between FGF
signalling and p63 in the expansion of epithelial progenitor cells and provide
mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of AEC syndrome.

We investigated the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with replicative 
senescence in human primary keratinocytes. A cohort of miRNAs up-regulated in
senescence was identified by genome-wide miRNA profiling, and their change in
expression was validated in proliferative versus senescent cells. Among these,
miRNA (miR)-138, -181a, -181b, and -130b expression increased with serial
passages. miR-138, -181a, and -181b, but not miR-130b, overexpression in
proliferating cells was sufficient per se to induce senescence, as evaluated by
inhibition of BrdU incorporation and quantification of senescence-activated
ß-galactosidase staining. We identified Sirt1 as a direct target of miR-138,
-181a, and -181b, whereas <U+0394>Np63 expression was inhibited by miR-130b. We also
found that <U+0394>Np63a inhibits miR-138, -181a, -181b, and -130b expression by binding
directly to p63-responsive elements located in close proximity to the genomic
loci of these miRNAs in primary keratinocytes. These findings suggest that
changes in miRNA expression, by modulating the levels of regulatory proteins such
as p63 and Sirt1, strongly contribute to induction of senescence in primary human
keratinocytes, thus linking these two proteins. Our data also indicate that
suppression of miR-138, -181a, -181b, and -130b expression is part of a
growth-promoting strategy of <U+0394>Np63a in epidermal proliferating cells.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of the present study was to investigate the
expression of Ki-67, P53 and P63 in hydropic abortion and partial mole and to
explore possible role of these three parameters in distinguishing partial mole
from hydropic.
METHODS: The hydropic abortion (n = 13) and partial mole (n = 23) were retrieved 
from the files of 2002 to 2010 at the Department of Pathology, Peking University 
People's Hospital and Department of Pathology, Haidian Maternal and Child Health 
Hospita1. All cases had typical histological features and complete clinical
information. All pathologic diagnoses were reviewed by two gynaecologic
pathologists and had no conflict. All cases showed P57 negative, which can
exclude the diagnosis of CHM. An immunochemical study of the expressions of
Ki-67, P53 and P63 was performed.
RESULTS: Microscopically, the pathologic characteristics of a HA include villous 
oedema with minimal to no cistern formation and mild trophoblastic hyperplasia.
In contrast, the pathologic features of PHM were characterized by focal
trophoblastic hyperplasia and a variable degree of hydropic swelling with central
cistern formation. The Ki-67 expression was observed in the nuclear of
cytotrophoblastic cell and intermediate trophoblasts population within placental 
tissue. The Ki-67 expression in HA is less than that in PHM. The p53 expression
was observed in the nuclear of cytotrophoblastic cell and intermediate
trophoblasts population within placental tissue. There was a significant
difference between HA and PHM. Positive staining for P63 was localized in the
nuclei of cytotrophoblastic cell population. No significant difference was
observed in positive rate of p63 expression between HA and PHM.
CONCLUSION: The high Ki-67 labeling index and over-expression of p53, detected by
immunohistochemistry, could serve as useful adjuncts to conventional methods of
diagnosis in distinguishing PHM from HA. Due to, however, the limited samples, it
needs to expand the number of the cases to verify this conclusion.

Congenital erosive and vesicular dermatosis is a rare syndrome first described by
Cohen et al in 1985. Most of the 18 cases published have been reported in
premature newborns. Affected babies typically present with erosions and vesicles 
that tend to heal shortly after birth with reticulated scaring. We report an
additional case, followed up for 5 years, in which we excluded a pathogenic
mutation in the TP63 gene.

Expression of p63 is essential for the formation of epidermis and other
stratifying epithelia. Moreover p63 is highly expressed in several epithelial
cancers and is involved in tumourigenesis and controlling chemo-sensitivity. The 
identification of p63 interacting partners is essential for understanding the
complex network of gene regulation managing epithelial development and could also
help to reveal signalling pathways participating in UV-damage response in human
skin. We used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with
deltaNp63. Proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with deltaNp63 specific 
antibody and analysed by mass spectrometry. We identified 23 proteins as
potential deltaNp63 binding partners that were not present in negative control
samples. These results will be evaluated using other methods.

p63 is a transcription factor which plays an important role in epidermal
development, differentiation and tumourigenesis. p63 belongs to the p53 protein
family and at least six isoforms were identified to date. p63 isoforms play
contrary roles during the development and formation of the epidermis as well as
in cancer. p63 participates in epithelial development, where it affects
proliferation and differentiation of epidermal cells. Inherited mutations in the 
TP63 gene generate different developmental defects and p63 knockout in mice
results in the absence of epidermis. Another important role of p63 is the control
of cell-cell adhesion, where it regulates desmosomes. The loss of proliferation
and cell-cell adhesion control are important for tumourigenesis and
overexpression of p63 can enhance tumour growth and inhibit apoptosis. This

Mutations in the TP53 gene commonly result in the expression of a full-length
protein that drives cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Herein, we have
deciphered the global landscape of transcriptional regulation by mutant p53
through the application of a panel of isogenic H1299 derivatives with inducible
expression of several common cancer-associated p53 mutants. We found that the
ability of mutant p53 to alter the transcriptional profile of cancer cells is
remarkably conserved across different p53 mutants. The mutant p53 transcriptional
landscape was nested within a small subset of wild-type p53 responsive genes,
suggesting that the oncogenic properties of mutant p53 are conferred by retaining
its ability to regulate a defined set of p53 target genes. These mutant p53
target genes were shown to converge upon a p63 signalling axis. Both mutant p53
and wild-type p63 were co-recruited to the promoters of these target genes, thus 
providing a molecular basis for their selective regulation by mutant p53. We
demonstrate that mutant p53 manipulates the gene expression pattern of cancer
cells to facilitate invasion through the release of a pro-invasive secretome into
the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, this study provides mechanistic insight
into the complex nature of transcriptional regulation by mutant p53 and
implicates a role for tumor-derived p53 mutations in the manipulation of the
cancer cell secretome.

Pterygium syndromes are complex congenital disorders that encompass several
distinct clinical conditions characterized by multiple skin webs affecting the
flexural surfaces often accompanied by craniofacial anomalies. In severe forms,
such as in the autosomal-recessive Bartsocas-Papas syndrome, early lethality is
common, complicating the identification of causative mutations. Using exome
sequencing in a consanguineous family, we identified the homozygous mutation
c.1127C>A in exon 7 of RIPK4 that resulted in the introduction of the nonsense
mutation p.Ser376X into the encoded ankyrin repeat-containing kinase, a protein
that is essential for keratinocyte differentiation. Subsequently, we identified a
second mutation in exon 2 of RIPK4 (c.242T>A) that resulted in the missense
variant p.Ile81Asn in the kinase domain of the protein. We have further
demonstrated that RIPK4 is a direct transcriptional target of the protein p63, a 
master regulator of stratified epithelial development, which acts as a nodal
point in the cascade of molecular events that prevent pterygium syndromes.

Since the discovery of the TP63 gene in 1998, many studies have demonstrated that
<U+0394>Np63, a p63 isoform of the p53 gene family, is involved in multiple functions
during skin development and in adult stem/progenitor cell regulation. In
contrast, TAp63 studies have been mostly restricted to its apoptotic function and
more recently as the guardian of oocyte integrity. TAp63 endogenous expression is
barely detectable in embryos and adult (except in oocytes), presumably because of
its rapid degradation and the lack of antibodies able to detect weak expression. 
Nevertheless, two recent independent studies have demonstrated novel functions
for TAp63 that could have potential implications to human pathologies. The first 
discovery is related to the protective role of TAp63 on premature aging. TAp63
controls skin homeostasis by maintaining dermal and epidermal progenitor/stem
cell pool and protecting them from senescence, DNA damage and genomic
instability. The second study is related to the role of TAp63, expressed by the
primitive endoderm, on heart development. This unexpected role for TAp63 has been
discovered by manipulation of embryonic stem cells in vitro and confirmed by the 
severe cardiomyopathy observed in brdm2 p63-null embryonic hearts. Interestingly,
in both cases, TAp63 acts in a cell-nonautonomous manner on adjacent cells. Here,
we discuss these findings and their potential connection during development.

BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of survivin and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are
often found over-expressed in human cancers, including colorectal cancer, and
have been implicated in tumorigenesis. HDAC inhibition induces growth arrest and 
cell death in various transformed cell; however, the mechanisms by which this
reduces cell viability in colorectal cancer cells remain unexplained.
METHODS: We explored the actions of two HDAC inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA) and
sirtinol, in HT29 colon cancer cells.
RESULTS: TSA and sirtinol induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in
HT29 cells. These results are associated with the modulation of survivin.
Survivin promoter luciferase activity and Sp1, a transcription factor that
contributes to survivin expression, were suppressed in cells exposed to TSA or
sirtinol. TSA and sirtinol also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38MAPK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibitors of p38MAPK or AMPK 
signaling abrogated TSA and sirtinol's effects of decreasing cell viability.
Survivin promoter luciferase activity in the presence of TSA or sirtinol was
restored by AMPK dominant negative mutant or p38MAPK inhibitor. Furthermore, Sp1 
binding to the survivin promoter region decreased while p63 binding to the
promoter region increased after TSA or sirtinol exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a p38MAPK- and AMPK-mediated downregulation of survivin,
and its functional correlation with decreased colon cancer cell viability in the 
presence of HDAC inhibitor. p63 and Sp1 may also contribute to TSA and sirtinol
actions.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study delineates, in part, the underlying mechanisms
of TSA and sirtinol in decreasing survivin expression and subsequent colon cancer
cell viability.

The p53 family of transcription factors--comprising p53, p63 and p73--plays an
important role in tumor prevention and development. Essential to their function
is the formation of tetramers, allowing cooperative binding to their DNA response
elements. We solved crystal structures of the human p63 tetramerization domain,
showing that p63 forms a dimer of dimers with D2 symmetry composed of highly
intertwined monomers. The primary dimers are formed via an intramolecular ß-sheet
and hydrophobic helix packing (H1), a hallmark of all p53 family members. Like
p73, but unlike p53, p63 requires a second helix (H2) to stabilize the
architecture of the tetramer. In order to investigate the impact of structural
differences on tetramer stability, we measured the subunit exchange reaction of
p53 family homotetramers by nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry. There were
differences in both the kinetics and the pattern of the exchange reaction, with
the p53 and p63 tetramers exhibiting much faster exchange kinetics than p73. The 
structural similarity between p63 and p73 rationalizes previous observations that
p63 and p73 form mixed tetramers, and the kinetic data reveal the dissociation of
the p73 homotetramers as the rate-limiting step for heterotetramer formation.
Differential stability of the tetramers may play an important role in the cross
talk between different isoforms and regulation of p53, p63 and p73 function in
the cell cycle.

INTRODUCTION: Yes-associated protein (YAP) is considered an oncogene found
amplified in multiple tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). However, the role for YAP expression in HNSCC is not understood. Based
on the central role of YAP in the hippo pathway, we tested if YAP was associated 
with the stage of HNSCC progression and metastatic potential.
METHODS: To determine the expression of YAP in human benign and HNSCC tissue
specimens, immunohistochemical analyses were performed in whole tissue samples
and tissue microarrays. The expression of YAP in tissues of microarray was first 
associated with clinic-pathologic factors and results verified in samples from
whole tissue sections. To investigate the role of YAP and p63 in regulating HNSCC
epithelial to mesenchymal transition, epithelial and mesenchymal markers were
assayed in Fadu and SCC-25 cells, HNSCC cells with endogenously elevated YAP
expression and siRNA-mediated expression knockdown.
RESULTS: Analysis of human HNSCC tissues suggested YAP expression was elevated in
tumors compared to benign tissues and specifically localized at the tumor
invasive front (p value < 0.05). But, indexed YAP expression was lower with
greater tumor grade (p value <U+200A>= <U+200A>0.02). In contrast, p63 expression was primarily
elevated in high-grade tumors. Interestingly, both YAP and p63 was strongly
expressed at the tumor invasive front and in metastatic HNSCC. Strikingly, we
demonstrated YAP expression in the primary HNSCC tumor was associated with nodal 
metastasis in univariate analysis (p value <U+200A>= <U+200A>0.02). However, the knockdown of
YAP in Fadu and SCC-25 cell lines was not associated with changes in epithelial
to mesenchymal transdifferentiation or p63 expression.
CONCLUSION: Together, YAP expression, in combination with p63 can facilitate
identification of HNSCC tumors from hyperplastic and benign tissues and the
metastatic function of YAP in HNSCC may not be a result of epithelia to
mesenchymal transdifferentiation.

We present a patient with a 2-cm spiradenocarcinoma of the left arm resembling
low-grade salivary gland basal cell adenocarcinoma. In addition to showing
attributes of conventional spiradenoma, the benign component showed prominent
areas of cystic change with focal apocrine differentiation, glands with and
without mucinous differentiation, clear cell change and focal adenoid cystic
carcinoma-like areas. The malignant component was composed of nodules of basaloid
cells arranged in sheets with variable tendency to luminal differentiation. The
nuclear atypia was low-grade, and the mitotic index was high in the malignant
component (to 8/10 high power fields). Immunohistochemically, there was diffuse
but variable positivity for cytokeratin 7 in both the benign and malignant
components. Epithelial membrane antigen was focally positive, highlighting cells 
with ductal (luminal) differentiation. Expression of p63 was observed in 50 and
80% of the cells in the benign and malignant components, respectively. Calponin
was negative. The proliferative index (MIB-1/Ki-67) was <3% in the benign
component and up to 10% in the malignant component. Although the malignant
component displayed patchy areas with nuclear p53 immunoreactivity with variable 
intensity, no mutation in the TP53 gene was identified.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease of the white blood
cells. The etiology of ALL is believed to be multifactorial and likely to involve
an interplay of environmental and genetic variables. We performed a genome-wide
association study of 355<U+2009>750 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 474
controls and 419 childhood ALL cases characterized by a t(12;21)(p13;q22) - the
most common chromosomal translocation observed in childhood ALL - which leads to 
an ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The eight most strongly associated SNPs were
followed-up in 951 ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases and 3061 controls from
Germany/Austria and Italy, respectively. We identified a novel, genome-wide
significant risk locus at 3q28 (TP63, rs17505102, P(CMH)=8.94 × 10(-9), OR=0.65).
The separate analysis of the combined German/Austrian sample only, revealed
additional genome-wide significant associations at 11q11 (OR8U8, rs1945213,
P=9.14 × 10(-11), OR=0.69) and 8p21.3 (near INTS10, rs920590, P=6.12 × 10(-9),
OR=1.36). These associations and another association at 11p11.2 (PTPRJ,
rs3942852, P=4.95 × 10(-7), OR=0.72) remained significant in the German/Austrian 
replication panel after correction for multiple testing. Our findings demonstrate
that germline genetic variation can specifically contribute to the risk of
ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood ALL. The identification of TP63 and PTPRJ as
susceptibility genes emphasize the role of the TP53 gene family and the
importance of proteins regulating cellular processes in connection with
tumorigenesis.

In response to stress, p53 binds and transactivates the internal TP53 promoter,
thus regulating the expression of its own isoform, <U+0394>133p53a. Here, we report
that, in addition to p53, at least four p63/p73 isoforms regulate <U+0394>133p53
expression at transcriptional level: p63ß, <U+0394>Np63a, <U+0394>Np63ß and <U+0394>Np73<U+03B3>. This
regulation occurs through direct DNA-binding to the internal TP53 promoter as
demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and the use of DNA-binding mutant
p63. The promoter regions involved in the p63/p73-mediated transactivation were
identified using deleted, mutant and polymorphic luciferase reporter constructs. 
In addition, we observed that transient expression of p53 family members
modulates endogenous <U+0394>133p53a expression at both mRNA and protein levels. We also
report concomitant variation of p63 and <U+0394>133p53 expression during keratinocyte
differentiation of HaCat cells and induced pluripotent stem cells derived from
mutated p63 ectodermal dysplasia patients. Finally, proliferation assays
indicated that <U+0394>133p53a isoform regulates the anti-proliferative activities of
p63ß, <U+0394>Np63a, <U+0394>Np63ß and <U+0394>Np73<U+03B3>. Overall, this study shows a strong interplay
between p53, p63 and p73 isoforms to orchestrate cell fate outcome.

Shape-induced terminal differentiation of human epidermal stem cells requires p38
and is regulated by histone acetylation.

Engineered model substrates are powerful tools for examining interactions between
stem cells and their microenvironment. Using this approach, we have previously
shown that restricted cell adhesion promotes terminal differentiation of human
epidermal stem cells via activation of serum response factor (SRF) and
transcription of AP-1 genes. Here we investigate the roles of p38 MAPK and
histone acetylation. Inhibition of p38 activity impaired SRF transcriptional
activity and shape-induced terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes. In
addition, inhibiting p38 reduced histone H3 acetylation at the promoters of SRF
target genes, FOS and JUNB. Although histone acetylation correlated with SRF
transcriptional activity and target gene expression, treatment with the histone
de-acetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) blocked terminal differentiation on 
micro-patterned substrates and in suspension. TSA treatment simultaneously
maintained expression of LRIG1, TP63, and ITGB1. Therefore, global histone
de-acetylation represses stem cell maintenance genes independent of SRF. Our
studies establish a novel role for extrinsic physical cues in the regulation of
chromatin remodeling, transcription, and differentiation of human epidermal stem 
cells.

INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing non-small cell lung cancer on biopsy/cellblock samples
by morphology may be demanding. As sparing material for molecular testing is
mandatory, a minimalist immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based diagnostic approach is
warranted by means of novel, reliable, and easy-to-assess biomarkers.
METHODS: Forty-six consecutive biopsy/cellblock samples and the corresponding
resection specimens (as the gold standard for morphology and IHC) from 30
adenocarcinomas (AD), 10 squamous carcinomas (SQC), 5 adenosquamous carcinomas
(ADSQC), and 1 sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) were IHC-evaluated for p40
[corresponding to nontransactivating <U+0394>Np63 isoforms] and thyroid transcription
factor-1 (TTF1) by semiquantitative assessment. For p40, also immunodecoration
intensity was taken into account and dichotomized as strong or low.
RESULTS: Nonrandom and overlapping distributions of the relevant markers were
found in biopsy/cellblock and surgical specimens, which closely correlated with
each other and the diverse tumor categories, with no differences in area under
curve-receiver-operating-characteristic curves for each marker between any two
samples, including p40 and p63. Diagnostic combinations were p40-/TTF1+ or TTF1- 
for AD (where p40 was negative, apart from 5/30 AD showing at the best 1-2% tumor
cells with low intensity); p40+/TTF1- (p40 strong and by far higher than 50%) for
SQC; and p40+/TTF1+ or p40+/TTF1- (p40 strong and less than 50%) for ADSQC. The
single SC case was p40-/TTF1-, suggesting glandular lineage. Practically, 41/46
(89%) tumors were correctly classified by IHC on small samples, including 30 AD, 
10 SQC, 1/5 ADSQC, and no SC. Underdiagnosis of ADSQC was actually because of
sampling error of biopsies/cellblocks rather than insufficient biomarker
robustness, whereas underdiagnosis of SC was really because of the failure of
either marker to highlight epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
CONCLUSIONS: This minimalist IHC-based model of p40 and TTF1 on biopsy/cellblock 
samples was effective to correctly subtype most cases of lung cancer.

The cisplatin-induced ATM-dependent phosphorylated (p)-<U+0394>Np63a plays an important 
role in transcriptional regulation of specific genes encoding mRNAs and microRNAs
(miRs) implicated in cell death, cell survival, and chemoresistance. The
p-<U+0394>Np63a-induced miR-885-3p functions as a critical regulator of MDM4, ATK1,
BCL2, ATG16L2, ULK2, CASP2, and CASP3 mRNAs via pairing with their respective
'recognition' sequences. Cisplatin exposure modulated the levels of target
proteins (reduced BCL2, AKT1, ATG16L2, and ULK2, while activated MDM4) in
cisplatin-sensitive wild type <U+0394>Np63a cells leading to distinct changes in cell
viability. Finally, miR-885-3p modulated the cisplatin-induced TP53-dependent
mitochondrial apoptosis by up regulation of MDM4 levels and down regulation of
BCL2 levels in mitochondria. Altogether, our results support the notion that
miR-885-3p might contribute in regulation of cell viability, apoptosis and/or
autophagy in squamous cell carcinoma cells upon cisplatin exposure.

Heterozygous mutations in TP63 cause a wide spectrum of autosomal dominant
developmental disorders variably affecting skin, limbs, and face. TP63 encodes
p63, a protein expressed in two main isoforms (Tap63 and <U+0394>Np63) with critical
roles in both cell differentiation and development. Some analyses suggest a
relationship of the mutation site to the observed clinical picture, although this
link is inconsistent. This suggests an appreciable phenotypic continuity within
the TP63-related disorders. We report a 3-month-old boy ascertained for
congenital scalp erosion and mild features of ectodermal dysplasia. His mother
showed full-blown characteristics of Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome plus intense abdominal
and popliteal freckling. Molecular investigation identified the novel TP63
mutation c.1697delG. We used a luciferase reporter assay to compare the effects
on the p63 transactivation (TA) activity of c.1697delG with that of the
p.Arg280Cys and p.Gln634X mutations, associated with ectrodactyly-ectodermal
dysplasia-cleft lip/palate syndrome and isolated split hand/foot malformation,
respectively. These results demonstrated complex behavior of c.1697delG in the TA
of genes involved in epidermal differentiation and development and shed further
light in the physiopathology of TP63-related disorders.

Ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting (EEC) syndrome is the prototype of
several p63 conditions, which include ankyloblepharon, ectodermal dysplasia,
clefting (AEC) syndrome, limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome
(RHS), ADULT syndrome, and others. All these disorders include combinations of
ectodermal dysplasia, orofacial clefting and limb malformations in variable
severity. A newborn patient is presented with diffuse erythematous and
desquamating skin lesions and anal atresia. She also had sparse and lightly
colored thin hair, deeply set eyes, hypoplastic alae nasi, and a short philtrum. 
Cleft lip/palate and ankyloblepharon were not present. Complete cutaneous
syndactyly was present on both hands in between the third and fourth fingers.
Mild ectrodactyly was evident on all four extremities in between first and second
digits. There was post-axial polydactyly on both feet. Anal atresia was present
and defecation occurred through a rectovaginal fistula. The patient represented
an interesting overlapping clinical condition between AEC and EEC syndromes.
Diffuse skin lesions with excoriation and desquamation suggest AEC syndrome,
despite the absence of ankyloblepharon, however; ectrodactyly and polydactyly
strongly suggest the EEC syndrome. C308Y mutation in exon 8 of TP63 gene was
detected, which was previously described to lead only to EEC syndrome and not to 
any of the other allelic conditions. These data emphasize the large degree of
clinical variability that may be seen for specific TP63 mutations.

We report on a mother and son who were affected with split hand-split foot
(formerly described as ectrodactyly), ectodermal dysplasia, hyperpigmentation of 
skin, and dystrophic nails. Their hair was wiry, brownish, and slow-growing.
Scanning electron micrography of their scalp hair showed hypoplastic hair bulbs, 
partial loss of hair cuticles, and frayed hair shafts. The son was affected with 
amelogenesis Imperfecta (hypocalcification, hypoplasia, and hypomaturation
types), in the primary and permanent dentition. An unerupted supernumerary
maxillary second premolar and fusion of mandibular incisors were observed in the 
primary dentition and their permanent successors. Mutation analysis showed a
c.588-2A<U+2009>><U+2009>C mutation in TP63 in the mother and her son. It is predicted that an 
alternative splice site was used, specifically the AG located just three
nucleotides upstream. Use of this site is predicted to include three extra
nucleotides in the transcript and thus incorporation of a single extra amino acid
(p.Thr195_Tyr196insPro). This is the first time that amelogenesis imperfecta,
fusion of teeth, and a supernumerary premolar have been shown to be associated
with a TP63 mutation.

Immunohistochemistry has recently emerged as a powerful ancillary tool for
differentiating lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma-a distinction
with important therapeutic implications. Although the most frequently recommended
squamous marker p63 is extremely sensitive, it suffers from low specificity due
to its reactivity in a substantial proportion of lung adenocarcinomas and other
tumor types, particularly lymphomas. p40 is a relatively unknown antibody that
recognizes <U+0394>Np63-a p63 isoform suggested to be highly specific for squamous/basal
cells. Here we compared the standard p63 antibody (4A4) and p40 in a series of
470 tumors from the archives of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and The
Johns Hopkins Hospital, which included lung squamous cell carcinomas (n=81),
adenocarcinomas (n=237), and large cell lymphomas (n=152). The p63 was positive
in 100% of squamous cell carcinomas, 31% of adenocarcinomas, and 54% of large
cell lymphomas (sensitivity 100%, specificity 60%). In contrast, although p40 was
also positive in 100% of squamous cell carcinomas, only 3% of adenocarcinomas,
and none of large cell lymphomas had p40 labeling (sensitivity 100%, specificity 
98%). The mean percentage of p63 versus p40-immunoreactive cells in squamous cell
carcinomas was equivalent (97 vs 96%, respectively, P=0.73). Rare adenocarcinomas
with p40 labeling had reactivity in no more than 5% of tumor cells, whereas the
mean (range) of p63-positive cells in adenocarcinomas and lymphomas was 26%
(1-90%) and 48% (2-100%), respectively. In summary, p40 is equivalent to p63 in
sensitivity for squamous cell carcinoma, but it is markedly superior to p63 in
specificity, which eliminates a potential pitfall of misinterpreting a
p63-positive adenocarcinoma or unsuspected lymphoma as squamous cell carcinoma.
These findings strongly support the routine use of p40 in place of p63 for the
diagnosis of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma.

The ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome is a rare autosomal
dominant disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the p63 gene, a
transcription factor belonging to the p53 family. The majority of cases of
ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome are caused by de novo mutations and
are therefore sporadic in approximately 60% of patients. The substitution of
arginine to histidine (R279H), due to a c.836G>A mutation in exon 7 of the p63
gene, represents 55% of the identified mutations and is considered a mutational
hot spot. A quantitative and sensitive real-time PCR was performed to quantify
both wild-type and R279H alleles in DNA extracted from peripheral blood and RNA
from cultured epithelial cells. Standard curves were constructed for both
wild-type and mutant probes. The sensitivity of the assay was determined by
generating serial dilutions of the DNA isolated from heterozygous patients (50%
of alleles mutated) with wild-type DNA, thus obtaining decreasing percentages of 
p63 R279H mutant allele (50%, 37.5%, 25%, 12.5%, 10%, 7.5%, 5%, 2.5%, and 0.0%). 
The assay detected up to 1% of the mutant p63. The high sensitivity of the assay 
is of particular relevance to prenatal diagnosis and counseling and to detect
therapeutic effects of drug treatment or gene therapy aimed at reducing the
amount of mutated p63.

TAp63<U+03B3> enhances nucleotide excision repair through transcriptional regulation of 
DNA repair genes.

p63 and p73, two p53 family members, play crucial roles in development and tumor 
suppression. p63 and p73 have multiple isoforms, which have similar or distinct
biological functions. Transactivation (TA) isoforms of p63 and p73 have high
similarity with p53 and often have biological functions similar to p53. p53 plays
an important role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) through transcriptional
regulation of target genes involved in NER, including DDB2, XPC and GADD45. To
investigate whether TAp63 and TAp73 play a similar role in NER, Saos2 cells with 
inducible expression of specific isoforms of TAp63 and TAp73, including
TAp63a/ß/<U+03B3> and TAp73a/ß/<U+03B3> isoforms, were employed. Overexpression of TAp63<U+03B3>
significantly enhances NER of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage, including
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts, and enhances cell
survival after UV irradiation in Soas2 cells. The enhancement of NER of
UV-induced DNA damage by TAp63<U+03B3> was also confirmed in H1299 cells with
overexpression of TAp63<U+03B3>. Consistently, knockdown of endogenous TAp63 decreases
NER of UV-induced DNA damage in H1299 cells. TAp63a/ß and TAp73a/ß/<U+03B3> isoforms do 
not have a clear effect on NER in Saos2 or H1299 cells. TAp63<U+03B3> overexpression
clearly induces the expression of DDB2, XPC and GADD45 at both RNA and protein
levels. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays show that TAp63<U+03B3>
transcriptionally activates DDB2, XPC and GADD45 genes through the regulation of 
the p53 binding elements in these genes. These results demonstrate that TAp63<U+03B3>
enhances NER to remove UV-induced DNA damage and maintain genomic stability
through transcriptional induction of a set of NER proteins, which provides an
additional important mechanism that contributes to the function of TAp63 in tumor
suppression.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly resistant to current
chemotherapy regimens, in part due to alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor
pathway. p53 homolog p63 is a transcription factor essential for the development 
and differentiation of epithelial surfaces. However its function in cancer is
controversial and its role in PDAC is not known. We discovered that <U+0394>Np63a was
the predominantly expressed p63 variant in pancreatic cancer cell lines. <U+0394>Np63a
protein and mRNA levels were high in T3M4, BxPC3 and COLO-357 pancreatic cancer
cells and low in ASPC-1 and PANC-1 cells. Overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a in PANC-1
cells and shRNA-mediated knockdown in T3M4 cells indicated that <U+0394>Np63a promoted
anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, motility and invasion, and enhanced 
resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) signaling pathways contribute to the biological aggressiveness of PDAC,
and we found that the motogenic effects of <U+0394>Np63a were augmented in presence of
EGF. Ectopic expression of <U+0394>Np63a resulted in upregulation of EGFR and
ß1-integrin in PANC-1 cells. Conversely, <U+0394>Np63a knockdown had an opposite effect 
in T3M4 cells. <U+0394>Np63a potentiated EGF-mediated activation of ERK, Akt and JNK
signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and functional reporter assays
demonstrated that <U+0394>Np63a activated EGFR transcription. 14-3-3s transcription was 
also positively regulated by <U+0394>Np63a and we have previously shown that 14-3-3s
contributes to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Conversely,
shRNA-mediated knockdown of 14-3-3s led to abrogation of the <U+0394>Np63a effects on
cell proliferation and invasion. Thus, p53 homolog <U+0394>Np63a enhances the oncogenic 
potential of pancreatic cancer cells through trans-activation of EGFR and
14-3-3s.

c-Jun regulates the stability of anti-apoptotic <U+0394>Np63 in amyloid-ß-induced

p63, the structural and functional homologue of p53, is expressed either as a
full-length isoform, containing a transactivation (TA) domain (TAp63), or as a
truncated isoform, which lacks TA (<U+0394>Np63). Amyloid-ß (Aß) incubation of neuronal 
cells results in stress-induced cell death through poorly understood mechanisms. 
We investigated the role of p63 in Aß-induced stress. Our results show that
Aß-induced apoptosis of rat PC12 neuronal-like cells and primary cortical neurons
was associated with stabilization of pro-apoptotic TAp63 and, most importantly,
degradation of anti-apoptotic <U+0394>Np63 through a MAPK- and proteasome-dependent
mechanism. This was associated with increased c-Jun, and partially modulated by
tauroursodeoxycholic acid. As expected, classic genotoxic insults resulted in
c-Jun upregulation and concomitant <U+0394>Np63 reduction. Endogenous and ectopic <U+0394>Np63 
expression was also markedly reduced by c-Jun overexpression. Further,
Aß-mediated <U+0394>Np63 degradation occurred in a c-Jun-dependent manner.
Downregulation of c-Jun expression by specific c-Jun siRNA abrogated the
reduction of <U+0394>Np63 levels following Aß insult, whereas overexpression of c-Jun
led to its degradation. c-Jun significantly decreased <U+0394>Np63 half-life. Together, 
these findings demonstrate that the abundance of anti-apoptotic <U+0394>Np63 in response
to Aß-induced cell stress is regulated by a c-Jun-dependent mechanism, and
highlight the importance of finding novel targets for potential therapeutic
intervention.

MA 02115, USA.

p63 is a p53 homolog that is expressed in various normal epithelial tissues and
epithelial malignancies. Its expression in mesenchymal lesions has not been
examined in depth; therefore, we studied p63 expression by immunohistochemical
analysis in 650 soft tissue tumors. We found that p63 expression is limited in
soft tissue tumors. The majority of tumors studied were p63-, including all cases
of angiosarcoma, lipomatous neoplasms, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, solitary 
fibrous tumor, schwannoma, neurofibroma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and
leiomyosarcoma. Nuclear p63 reactivity was found in a subset of soft tissue
myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma of soft tissue, cellular
neurothekeoma, soft tissue perineurioma, Ewing sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal
tumor, diffuse-type giant cell tumor, and giant cell tumor of soft parts.
Infrequent, weak, or focal p63-staining patterns were observed in low-grade
fibromyxoid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extraskeletal
myxoid chondrosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma,
synovial sarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell
tumor, atypical fibroxanthoma, and spindle cell melanoma. Absent p63 expression
is typical for most soft tissue tumors, including most (but not all) that would
be in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell squamous carcinoma.

Tumor protein (TP)-p53 family members often play proapoptotic roles, whereas
nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) functions as a proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulator
depending on the cellular environment. We previously showed that the NF-<U+03BA>B
activation leads to the reduction of the TP63 isoform, <U+0394>Np63a, thereby rendering 
the cells susceptible to cell death upon DNA damage. However, the functional
relationship between TP63 isotypes and NF-<U+03BA>B is poorly understood. Here, we
report that the TAp63 regulates NF-<U+03BA>B transcription and protein stability
subsequently leading to the cell death phenotype. We found that TAp63a induced
the expression of the p65 subunit of NF-<U+03BA>B (RELA) and target genes involved in
cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, thereby triggering cell death pathways in MCF10A 
cells. RELA was shown to concomitantly modulate specific cell survival pathways, 
making it indispensable for the TAp63a-dependent regulation of cell death. We
showed that TAp63a and RELA formed protein complexes resulted in their mutual
stabilization and inhibition of the RELA ubiquitination. Finally, we showed that 
TAp63a directly induced RelA transcription by binding to and activating of its
promoter and, in turn, leading to activation of the NF-<U+03BA>B-dependent cell death
genes. Overall, our data defined the regulatory feedback loop between TAp63a and 
NF-<U+03BA>B involved in the activation of cell death process of cancer cells.

Dynamic life of a skin keratinocyte: an intimate tryst with the master regulator 
p63.

Sciences, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14203, USA.

Skin keratinocytes form a tightly knit and layered epithelium at the surface of
the body protecting the body from the outside environment. The formation and
maintenance of skin epidermis is governed by dynamic and well-coordinated
processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal. Such
important cell fate decisions are made possible in part by transcription factors,
which activate and repress unique sets of genes in a temporal and spatial
pattern. The Tp63 gene encodes for multiple isoforms for one such transcription
factor that serves as a key regulator of epidermal development and
differentiation. The crucial function of p63 is epitomized by the phenotype of
p63 knockout mice--in the absence of p63, there is a profound block in the
development of skin epidermis and all related appendages such as hair follicles. 
Human syndromes resulting from Tp63 gene mutations phenocopy the p63 knockout
phenotype, highlighting the evolutionarily conserved function of this factor in
epithelial biology. Although the function of p63 as an important hub in
transcriptional and signaling networks of keratinocytes is well established, the 
underlying molecular mechanisms of p63 action is continually redefined with the
development of new genetic models and more extensive biochemical analysis. In
this review the biological role of deltaNp63, the predominant isoform that is
expressed in skin keratinocytes has been described. Results from transgenic
animal models that have shed new information on the function of deltaNp63 in the 
epidermis and hair follicles have been discussed. Further, the molecular
mechanisms that maintain the fine-tuned expression of deltaNp63 in skin
keratinocytes are also described.

TP53, TP63, and TP73 genes comprise the p53 family. Each gene produces protein
isoforms through multiple mechanisms including extensive alternative mRNA
splicing. Accumulating evidence shows that these isoforms play a critical role in
the regulation of many biological processes in normal cells. Their abnormal
expression contributes to tumorigenesis and has a profound effect on tumor
response to curative therapy. This paper is an overview of isoform diversity in
the p53 family and its role in cancer.

Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare condition belonging
to the group of ectodermal dysplasias caused by TP63 mutations. Its clinical
phenotype is similar to ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC) 
and limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), and differs from these disorders mainly by the
absence of cleft lip and/or palate. We report on a 39-year-old patient who was
found to be heterozygous for a c.401G > T (p.Gly134Val) de novo mutation of TP63.
This patient had the ADULT phenotype associated with cleft palate. Our findings, 
rather than extend the clinical spectrum of ADULT syndrome, suggest that cleft
palate can no longer be considered an element for differential diagnosis for
ADULT, EEC, and LMS. Our data, added to other reports on overlapping phenotypes, 
support the combining of these three phenotypes into a unique entity that we
propose to call "ELA syndrome," which is an acronym of ectrodactyly-ectodermal
dysplasia-cleft lip and palate, limb-mammary, and ADULT syndromes.

Genes, active during normal development, are frequently reactivated during
neoplastic transformation and may be related to progression. One of them, the
transcription factor TP63, is crucial for pulmonary epithelial development and a 
possible target of the recurrent 3q amplifications in lung squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC). Here, we explored whether TP63 reactivation could be associated 
to cancer progression in lung SCC through an epithelial to mesenchymal
transition. We studied TP63 amplification and TP63 expression at RNA and protein 
levels and we analyzed the <U+0394>NTP63/TATP63 ratio that quantifies the proportion of 
the isoform lacking the transactivation domain/the isoform containing the
transactivation domain. We correlated TP63 status to survival and to the
expression of epithelial (E-cadherin and plakoglobin) and mesenchymal
(N-cadherin, vimentin, TWIST1, and SNAIL) markers. We found that high <U+0394>N/TA TP63 
ratio was related to high E-cadherin and plakoglobin mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and
that E-cadherin mRNA level was the only marker related to survival. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves stratified according to the expression level of E-cadherin
showed, as already reported in breast cancer, that patients with low (first
quartile) or high (last quartile) E-cadherin expression had a worse survival with
respect to patients with intermediate E-cadherin expression. Altogether, our
results indicate that a reactivation of <U+0394>NTP63 is linked to the maintenance of

Cervical carcinomas result from cellular transformation by the human
papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncogenes which are constitutively expressed in
cancer cells. The E6 oncogene degrades p53 thereby modulating a large set of p53 
target genes as shown previously in the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa. Here
we show that the TAp63ß isoform of the p63 transcription factor is also a target 
of E6. The p63 gene plays an essential role in skin homeostasis and is expressed 
as at least six isoforms. One of these isoforms, <U+0394>Np63a, has been found
overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas and is shown here to be constitutively 
expressed in Caski cells associated with HPV16. We therefore explored the role of
p63 in these cells by performing microarray analyses after repression of
endogenous E6/E7 expression. Upon repression of the oncogenes, a large set of p53
target genes was found activated together with many p63 target genes related to
cell adhesion. However, through siRNA silencing and ectopic expression of various
p63 isoforms we demonstrated that TAp63ß is involved in activation of this cell
adhesion pathway instead of the constitutively expressed <U+0394>Np63a and ß.
Furthermore, we showed in cotransfection experiments, combined with E6AP siRNA
silencing, that E6 induces an accelerated degradation of TAp63ß although not
through the E6AP ubiquitin ligase used for degradation of p53. Repression of E6
transcription also induces stabilization of endogenous TAp63ß in cervical
carcinoma cells that lead to an increased concentration of focal adhesions at the
cell surface. Consequently, TAp63ß is the only p63 isoform suppressed by E6 in
cervical carcinoma as demonstrated previously for p53. Down-modulation of focal
adhesions through disruption of TAp63ß therefore appears as a novel E6-dependent 
pathway in transformation. These findings identify a major physiological role for
TAp63ß in anchorage independent growth that might represent a new critical
pathway in human carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Seborrhoeic keratoses (SKs) are very common benign epidermal lesions 
without malignant potential. Ultraviolet radiation, old age and viruses are
well-known risk factors for disease development. However, the pathomechanisms of 
SK are not fully understood.
OBJECTIVES: To detect and characterize the genes that are involved in the
pathogenesis of SK.
METHODS: We performed a gene expression study using paired lesional and
nonlesional skin samples from patients with SK.
RESULTS: We identified and validated 19 differentially expressed genes in SK. Of 
these 19 genes, we focused on p63 transcription factor, which plays a pivotal
role in epidermal development by regulating its transcriptional programme. We
found by immunofluorescence that the expression of <U+0394>Np63a, the most abundantly
expressed p63 isoform, was significantly increased in SK as compared with normal 
skin. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of <U+0394>Np63 led to the downregulation of 11
genes, including a member of the tensin family TNS4. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay revealed that TNS4 was a target gene of p63.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified upregulated genes in SK using genome-wide cDNA
microarray and elucidated the functional contribution of p63 to the disease
transcriptome by gene-silencing assay. Taken together, these data may provide a
novel insight into the molecular basis of these benign skin lesions.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the ocular phenotype in patients with
ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (EEC) syndrome (MIM#604292) and to
determine the pathogenic basis of visual morbidity.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen families (23 patients) affected by EEC syndrome from the
United Kingdom, Ireland, and Italy.
METHODS: General medical examination to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for EEC
syndrome and determine the phenotypic severity. Mutational analysis of p63 was
performed by polymerase chain reaction-based bidirectional Sanger sequencing. All
patients with EEC syndrome underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and ocular
surface assessment. Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) was diagnosed clinically
on the basis of corneal conjunctivalization and anatomy of the limbal palisades
of Vogt. Impression cytology using immunofluorescent antibodies was performed in 
1 individual. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on a
corneal button and corneal pannus from 2 EEC patients.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The EEC syndrome phenotypic severity (EEC score),
best-corrected Snellen visual acuity (decimal fraction), slit-lamp biomicroscopy,
tear function index, tear breakup time, LSCD, p63 DNA sequence variants,
impression cytology, and corneal histopathology.
RESULTS: Eleven heterozygous missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of p63 
were identified in all patients with EEC syndrome. All patients had ocular
involvement and the commonest was an anomaly of the meibomian glands and lacrimal
drainage system defects. The major cause of visual morbidity was progressive
LSCD, which was detected in 61% (14/23). Limbal stem cell deficiency was related 
to advancing age and caused a progressive keratopathy, resulting in a dense
vascularized corneal pannus, and eventually leading to visual impairment.
Histologic analysis and impression cytology confirmed LSCD.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous p63 mutations cause the EEC syndrome and result in
visual impairment owing to progressive LSCD. There was no relationship of limbal 
stem cell failure with the severity of EEC syndrome, as classified by the EEC
score, or the underlying molecular defect in p63.

BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP), which is a chronic inflammatory disease of 
the oral mucosa with unknown etiology, affects about 2% of the population.
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in normal processes such as
development and differentiation as well as progression of human diseases. The aim
of this study was to investigate the expression of miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-203 
and to compare RNA levels of their potential targets, the tumor suppressor p53
and its relative p63, both known to be deregulated in OLP.
METHODS: In biopsies from 20 patients with OLP and 20 age- and sex-matched
healthy controls, epithelium was laser dissected and analyzed for the expression 
of miR-21, miR-125b, miR-203, p53, and p63 using qRT/PCR.
RESULTS: Increased expression of miR-21 and miR-203, decreased expression of
miR-125, and down-regulation of p53 and <U+0394>Np63 RNA were seen in OLP compared to
normal oral mucosa. When comparing microRNA expression to levels of p53 and p63
RNA, a significant negative correlation was seen between <U+0394>Np63 and miR-203 and
between miR-21 and p53, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Results indicate a role for the studied microRNAs in changes seen in 
OLP.

The TP53 tumour-suppressor gene is expressed as several protein isoforms
generated by different mechanisms, including use of alternative promoters,
splicing sites and translational initiation sites, that are conserved through
evolution and within the TP53 homologues, TP63 and TP73. Although first described
in the eighties, the importance of p53 isoforms in regulating the suppressive
functions of p53 has only become evident in the last 10 years, by analogy with
observations that p63 and p73 isoforms appeared indispensable to fully understand
the biological functions of TP63 and TP73. This review summarizes recent advances
in the field of 'p53 isoforms', including new data on p63 and p73 isoforms.
Details of the alternative mechanisms that produce p53 isoforms and cis- and
trans-regulators identified are provided. The main focus is on their biological
functions (apoptosis, cell cycle, aging and so on) in cellular and animal models,
including mouse, zebrafish and Drosophila. Finally, the deregulation of p53
isoform expression in human cancers is reviewed. Based on these latest results,
several developments are expected in the future: the identification of drugs
modulating p53 isoform expression; the generation of animal models and the
evaluation of the use of p53 isoform as biomarkers in human cancers.

Inflammation-induced activation of proto-oncogenic NF-<U+03BA>B/REL and dysfunction of
tumor suppressor TP53/p63/p73 family transcription factors are key events in
cancer progression. How inflammatory signaling coordinates dysregulation of these
two transcription factor families during oncogenesis remains incompletely
understood. Here, we observed that oncoprotein c-REL and tumor suppressor TAp73
are coexpressed and complex with <U+0394>Np63a in the nucleus of a subset of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines with mutant (mt)TP53. TNF-a, a
proinflammatory cytokine, promoted c-REL nuclear translocation, c-REL/<U+0394>Np63a
interaction, and dissociation of TAp73 from <U+0394>Np63a and the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, whereas c-REL siRNA knockdown attenuated this effect. Overexpression
of c-REL or a c-REL <U+03BA>B-site DNA-binding mutant enhanced protein interaction with 
<U+0394>Np63a and TAp73 dissociation, implicating c-REL/<U+0394>Np63a-specific interactions in 
these effects. We discovered that TNF-a or genetic alteration of c-REL expression
inversely modulates <U+0394>Np63a/TAp73 interactions on distinct p63 DNA-binding sites, 
including those for key growth arrest and apoptotic genes p21WAF1, NOXA, and
PUMA. Functionally, c-REL repressed these genes and the antiproliferative effects
of TNF-a or TAp73. Conversely, c-REL siRNA depletion enhanced TAp73 promoter
interaction and expression of genes mediating growth arrest and apoptosis.
Similar to TNF-a-treated HNSCC lines, human HNSCC tumors and hyperplastic
squamous epithelia of transgenic mice overexpressing <U+0394>Np63a that exhibit
inflammation also show increased nuclear c-REL/<U+0394>Np63a and cytoplasmic TAp73
localization. These findings unveil a novel and reversible dynamic mechanism
whereby proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a-induced c-REL/<U+0394>Np63a interactions
inactivate tumor suppressor TAp73 function, promoting TNF-a resistance and cell
survival in cancers with mtTP53.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the predictive significance of 14 reported markers using
immunohistochemical study in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical stainings were done in 38 patients for Met,
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nm23-H1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p63, 
early growth response factor 1 (Egr1), chromosome segregation 1-like (CSE1L),
cathepsin-D (aspartyl protease), C-erbB2, p53, signal transducers and activators 
of transcription (STAT3/STAT5), CD138 (Syndecan-1), and LIN28 with the usual
methods.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 30 months (11-83 months). High Met and
CD138 expression were statistically significant negative prognostic factors on
survival. The expression of Egr1 had a positive prognostic effect on survival.
The combined score of these 3 markers, Met plus CD138 minus Egr1, was a strong
prognostic factor. The median survival curve was distinctly separated in accord
with this combined score. No prognostic value was revealed in COX-2, nm23-H1,
EGFR, p63, CSE1L, cathepsin-D, C-erbB2, p53, STAT3, STAT5, and LIN28.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined score of these markers could be used to stratify
biomolecular risk groups.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, the
transcriptional regulation of miRNAs themselves is not well understood. We
employed an integrative computational pipeline to dissect the transcription
factors (TFs) responsible for altered miRNA expression in ovarian carcinoma.
Using experimental data and computational predictions to define miRNA promoters
across the human genome, we identified TFs with binding sites significantly
overrepresented among miRNA genes overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma. This
pipeline nominated TFs of the p53/p63/p73 family as candidate drivers of miRNA
overexpression. Analysis of data from an independent set of 253 ovarian
carcinomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas showed that p73 and p63 expression is
significantly correlated with expression of miRNAs whose promoters contain
p53/p63/p73 family binding sites. In experimental validation of specific miRNAs
predicted by the analysis to be regulated by p73 and p63, we found that
p53/p63/p73 family binding sites modulate promoter activity of miRNAs of the
miR-200 family, which are known regulators of cancer stem cells and
epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. Furthermore, in chromatin immunoprecipitation
studies both p73 and p63 directly associated with the miR-200b/a/429 promoter.
This study delineates an integrative approach that can be applied to discover
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in other biological settings where
analogous genomic data are available.

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by
suprabasal cutaneous cell separation (acantholysis) leading to the development of
erosive and oozing skin lesion. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous
post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression with critical functions in
health and disease. Here, we evaluated whether the expression of specific miRNAs 
may play a role in the pathogenesis of HHD. Here, we report that miRNAs are
expressed in a non-random manner in Hailey-Hailey patients. miR-125b appeared a
promising candidate for playing a role in HHD manifestation. Both Notch1 and p63 
are part of a regulatory signalling whose function is essential for the control
of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and of note, the expression of 
both Notch1 and p63 is downregulated in HHD-derived keratinocytes. We found that 
both Notch1 and p63 expression is strongly suppressed by miR-125b expression.
Additionally, we found that miR-125b expression is increased by an oxidative
stress-dependent mechanism. Our data suggest that oxidative stress-mediated
induction of miR-125b plays a specific role in the pathogenesis of HHD by
regulating the expression of factors playing an important role in keratinocyte
proliferation and differentiation.

Genetic analysis of TP63 indicates that <U+0394>Np63 isoforms are required for
preservation of self-renewing capacity in the stem cell compartments of diverse
epithelial structures; however, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms 
remain incompletely defined. Cellular quiescence is a common feature of adult
stem cells that may account for their ability to retain long-term replicative
capacity while simultaneously limiting cellular division. Similarly, quiescence
within tumor stem cell populations may represent a mechanism by which these
populations evade cytotoxic therapy and initiate tumor recurrence. Here, we
present evidence that <U+0394>Np63a, the predominant TP63 isoform in the regenerative
compartment of diverse epithelial structuresm, promotes cellular quiescence via
activation of Notch signaling. In HC11 cells, ectopic <U+0394>Np63a mediates a
proliferative arrest in the 2N state coincident with reduced RNA synthesis
characteristic of cellular quiescence. Additionally, <U+0394>Np63a and other
quiescence-inducing stimuli enhanced expression of Notch3 in HC11s and breast
cancer cell lines, and ectopic expression of the Notch3 intracellular domain (N3 
(ICD) ) was sufficient to cause accumulation in G 0/G 1 and increased expression 
of two genes associated with quiescence, Hes1 and Mxi1. Pharmacologic inhibition 
of Notch signaling or shRNA-mediated suppression of Notch3 were sufficient to
bypass quiescence induced by <U+0394>Np63a and other quiescence-inducing stimuli. These 
studies identify a novel mechanism by which <U+0394>Np63a preserves long-term
replicative capacity by promoting cellular quiescence and identify the Notch
signaling pathway as a mediator of multiple quiescence-inducing stimuli,
including <U+0394>Np63a expression.

We report a 7-year-old boy with a past medical history of B-cell leukemia with
dysmorphic features, including cleft palate, hypotrichosis with trichorrhexis
nodosa, hypohidrosis, oligodontia, and ridging of nails. A heterozygous germline 
mutation, Ala111Thr, in the p63 gene was detected in the boy and in his mother,
who had no clinical expression. This case emphasizes the spectrum of different
phenotypical manifestations of mutations in the p63 gene and underlines the
possible role of this gene as a tumor suppressor.

Precise histopathological localization of E-cadherin and p63 is of immense
importance in understanding the integrity of oral mucosal stratified epithelium
in normal and diseased conditions. Necessarily immunohistochemical imaging should
have minimum bleaching impact on the dyes and ability to produce clear and crisp 
images. Here ApoTome provides an alternative with metal halide light source and
structured illumination under the assistance of grids, along with integrated
image processing modality to generate crisp images with digital interface. The
current study demonstrates the applicability of such microscopic system in
capturing fluorescence images of immunohistochemical sections of normal and
precancerous biopsies in respect to the expression of p63 and E-cadherin in the
epithelial cells. The ApoTome images localize the nuclear and membranous
expressions of p63 and E-cadherin, respectively, with remarkable specificity. The
findings on E-cadherin expression have enormous diagnostic significance as these 
images clearly differentiate the early and advanced stages of oral submucous
fibrosis based on their cytoplasmic and membranous location. Thus, this study
clearly depicts a remarkable performance of ApoTome with diagnostic significance.

PURPOSE: To characterize corneal epithelial cells separated from limbus in vivo
by transplantation of a stainless steel ring with or without creating a defect
inside the ring.
METHODS: A stainless steel ring (diameter, 8 mm; width, 300 µm; depth, 250 µm)
was transplanted into rabbit corneal stroma using 10-0 nylon interrupted suture
after cutting to a 250 µm depth by corneal vacuum trephine (diameter, 8.0 mm).
Epithelial cells were removed inside the ring, and re-epithelization was
evaluated after 1 week. Hematoxylin staining and immunostaining against p63,
Ki67, and cytokeratin 3 were performed for phenotypic analysis of corneal
epithelia. A corneal epithelial defect was centrally created inside the ring (4, 
5, and 6 mm diameter) after transplantation. When re-epithelization was achieved,
a central epithelial defect was continuously created until cells were exhausted
within the ring. The number of created defects was also analyzed to assess the
potential of re-epithelialization.
RESULTS: Ring-transplanted corneal stroma showed few signs of inflammation, and
when epithelium was totally removed from inside the ring, complete epithelial
defects were persistent for = 1 month. Corneal sensation was significantly
decreased in corneas with the ring (P < 0.05). Immunostaining demonstrated
similar expression patterns for p63, Ki67, and cytokeratin3 as the controls. When
rings were transplanted into the intact cornea, inside epithelia prevented
epithelial defects in vivo for = 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Transient-amplifying cells might maintain homeostasis for >1 month
when separated from their limbus in vivo. This model will be useful for future
stem cell research or wound healing models.

The present study focuses on the correlation between the expression pattern of
ß-catenin (component of Wnt signaling), <U+0394>Np63 (proliferation marker), and Notch 1
(transmembrane receptor) in oral squamous cell carcinoma. The study also aims to 
investigate the interaction between ß-catenin and <U+0394>Np63 in oral cancer.
Furthermore, we also analyzed the prognostic significance of ß-catenin, <U+0394>Np63,
and Notch 1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of
ß-catenin, <U+0394>Np63, and Notch 1 were done in 62 cases of oral squamous cell
carcinoma. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was done to study the possible
interaction between ß-catenin and <U+0394>Np63 in oral cancer. Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate overall and disease-free survival, and the Log-rank test was
used to compare the resulting curves. Statistically significant positive
correlation was found between the localization of ß-catenin and the expression of
<U+0394>Np63 (p = 0.001**, r (s) = 0.427), whereas, no significant association was found
between the expression pattern of ß-catenin and Notch 1. Interestingly,
interaction between ß-catenin and <U+0394>Np63 was observed in oral carcinoma. Moreover,
ß-catenin and <U+0394>Np63 may be related to worst survival in oral carcinoma.
Statistically significant positive association between localization of ß-catenin 
and expression of <U+0394>Np63 suggests that they might have dependent roles in
maintaining the proliferation of oral carcinoma cells. In addition, the
downregulated expression of Notch 1 was related to invasion and differentiation
status of oral carcinoma cells. Furthermore, ß-catenin and <U+0394>Np63 may be used as
independent prognostic markers of oral carcinoma. On the other hand, interaction 
of ß-catenin with <U+0394>Np63 may be a key event in maintaining the proliferation of
oral carcinoma cells. The present study indicates that ß-catenin and <U+0394>Np63 may be
used as independent prognostic markers of oral carcinoma and the interaction of
ß-catenin with <U+0394>Np63 may be a crucial event in regulating proliferation and
differentiation of oral carcinoma cells, which may be used as a target for
therapeutic implications.

p63 is a p53 family protein required for morphogenesis and postnatal regeneration
of epithelial tissues. Here we demonstrate that <U+0394>Np63a, a p63 isoform lacking the
N-terminal transactivation domain, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in primary human keratinocytes in a TGF-ß-dependent manner. Rapidly
proliferating normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were infected with
retroviral vector expressing <U+0394>Np63a or empty vector and serially subcultured
until replicative senescence. No phenotypic changes were observed until the
culture reached senescence. Then the <U+0394>Np63a-transduced cells underwent
morphological changes resembling mesenchymal cells and acquired the EMT
phenotype. Treatment with exogenous TGF-ß accelerated EMT in presenescent
<U+0394>Np63a-transduced cells, whereas the inhibition of TGF-ß signaling reversed the
EMT phenotype. TGF-ß treatment alone led to growth arrest in control NHEK with no
evidence of EMT, indicating that <U+0394>Np63a altered the cellular response to TGF-ß
treatment. <U+0394>Np63a-transduced cells acquiring EMT gained the ability to be
differentiated to osteo-/odontogenic and adipogenic pathways, resembling
mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, these cells expressed enhanced levels of
Nanog and Lin28, which are transcription factors associated with pluripotency.
These data indicate that EMT required <U+0394>Np63a transduction and intact TGF-ß
signaling in NHEK.

PURPOSE: The limbus of the cornea is said to be the niche for limbal stem cells
(LSCs) and the primary source of corneal epithelial maintenance. Previously, we
aimed to have shown that central human epithelial cells are capable of corneal
regeneration after wounding. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether
central epithelial cells in human corneas have LSC properties.
METHODS: Human corneal epithelial cells were separated from the central cornea
and the limbus. Isolated cells were collected for sphere-forming assay, and
spheres formed subsequently were analyzed using immunohistochemistry.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was also used to analyze epithelial
cells from central cornea, limbal rim, older donors, younger donors, and
dissociated spheres. These analyses were based on cell size and Hoechst 33342 dye
efflux ability, and side populations and non-side populations were isolated for
colony growth measurement and sphere-forming assay.
RESULTS: Human central and limbal epithelial cells were capable of forming
spheres, in a 1:2 ratio, that were positive for p63 immunolabeling. In FACS,
central and limbal epithelial cells showed no significant difference in cell size
and dye efflux ability. There were almost 10 times more large cells with good dye
efflux ability from younger donors than from older donors, and the gated side
population showed more than 4 times faster rate of colony growth than the
non-side population. Dissociated sphere cells, however, did not follow a similar 
pattern to tissue-derived cells using FACS analysis. In these, there were more
than twice as many large cells than small cells with good dye efflux ability.
CONCLUSIONS: Both limbal and central epithelial cells are capable of forming
spheres in cultures that have stem cell properties. Central and limbal epithelial
cells cannot be differentiated using FACS, but younger donor tissues give rise to
greater numbers of large cells with high dye efflux. Therefore, results indicate 
that human central corneal epithelium contains cells with stem/progenitor
properties, and these stem properties decline with age.

This study examined immunohistochemical expression of <U+0394>Np63, a keratinocyte stem 
cell marker, in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and
then to elucidate usefulness of <U+0394>Np63 as a marker for diagnosis and prognosis.
One-hundred and twelve cases of OL and 81 cases of OSCC were analyzed by
immunohistochemical staining for <U+0394>Np63, Ki-67, and cytokeratin 14. These labeling
indices (LIs) were calculated, and the association of these LIs with
clinicopathologic characteristics in the OL and OSCC was evaluated. In the OL,
these LIs increased significantly according to the severity of epithelial
dysplasia (p<0.0001). <U+0394>Np63-LI in the OL with malignant transformation was
significantly higher than that in the OL without (49.3 vs. 34.2%; p<0.01). In the
OSCC, the LIs increased significantly in association with the histologic grade
(p<0.0001). A significant difference between the high and low <U+0394>Np63-LI groups was
found in the incidence of cervical lymph node and distant metastasis (p<0.05).
The prognosis of the high <U+0394>Np63-LI (mean value >73.8%) group is poorer than that 
of the low <U+0394>Np63-LI (mean value =73.8%) group (p<0.05). These results suggested
that increased <U+0394>Np63 expression is involved in malignant transformation in
epithelial dysplasia and poor prognosis in OSCC.

Protein p63 is a key regulator in cell proliferation and cell differentiation in 
stratified squamous epithelium. <U+0394>Np63a is the most commonly expressed p63
isoform, which is often overexpressed in human tumor. In the present work we
report the potential involvement of <U+0394>Np63a in cell cycle regulation. <U+0394>Np63a
accumulated in mitotic cells but its expression decreased during mitotic exit.
Moreover, <U+0394>Np63a knockdown promoted mitotic exit. <U+0394>Np63a shares a conserved
destruction box (D-box) motif with other potential targets of the
Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). Overexpression of APC/C coactivator
Cdh1 destabilized <U+0394>Np63a. Our results suggest that <U+0394>Np63a level is cell
cycle-regulated and may play a role in the regulation of mitotic exit.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is one of the most widely used staining techniques for
diagnostic purposes. The selective localization of target proteins in tissue
specimens by conventional IHC is achieved with dye- or enzyme-labeled antibodies 
in combination with light microscopy. In this contribution, we demonstrate the
proof-of-principle for IHC based on surface-enhanced coherent Raman scattering
for contrast generation. Specifically, antibody-labeled metallic nanoshells in
conjunction with surface-enhanced coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (SECARS) 
microscopy are employed for the selective, sensitive, and rapid localization of
the basal cell protein p63 in normal prostate tissue. Negative control
experiments were performed in order to confirm the selective binding of the
target-specific metal nanoprobes and to disentangle the role of plasmonic (metal)
and molecular (Raman reporter) resonances in this plasmon-assisted four-wave
mixing technique.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, SCCHN, the sixth most common cancer
in the world, comprises tumours of different anatomical sites. The overall
survival is low, and there are no good prognostic or predictive markers
available. The p53 homologue, p63, plays an important role in development of
epithelial structures and has also been suggested to be involved in development
of SCCHN. However, most studies on p63 in SCCHN have not taken into account the
fact that this group of tumours is heterogeneous in terms of the particular site 
of origin of the cancer. Mapping and comparing p63 expression levels in tumours
and corresponding clinically normal tissue in SCCHN from gingiva, tongue and
tongue/floor of the mouth revealed clear differences between these regions. In
normal samples from tongue and gingiva, tongue samples showed 2.5-fold higher
median p63 expression and also more widespread expression compared to gingival
samples. These results emphasise the importance of taking sub-site within the
oral cavity into consideration in analyses of SCCHN.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common, morbid, and frequently
lethal malignancy. To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome
sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational
profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papillomavirus was detectable by 
sequencing DNA from infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known 
HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), our analysis revealed many
genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30% of cases
harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (for example, 
NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC
carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate the ability of large-scale
sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.

p63 is critical for squamous epithelial development, and elevated levels of the
<U+0394>Np63a isoform are seen in squamous cell cancers of various organ sites. However,
significant controversy exists regarding the role of p63 isoforms as oncoproteins
or tumor suppressors. Here, lentiviruses were developed to drive long-term
overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a in primary keratinocytes. Elevated levels of <U+0394>Np63a in
vitro promote long-term survival and block both replicative and oncogene-induced 
senescence in primary keratinocytes, as evidenced by the expression of SA-ß-gal
and the presence of nuclear foci of heterochromatin protein 1<U+03B3>. The contribution 
of <U+0394>Np63a to cancer development was assessed using an in vivo grafting model of
experimental skin tumorigenesis that allows distinction between benign and
malignant tumors. Grafted lenti-<U+0394>Np63a keratinocytes do not form tumors, whereas 
lenti-GFP/v-ras(Ha) keratinocytes develop well-differentiated papillomas.
Lenti-<U+0394>Np63a/v-ras(Ha) keratinocytes form undifferentiated carcinomas. The
average volume of lenti-<U+0394>Np63a/v-ras(Ha) tumors was significantly higher than
those in the lenti-GFP/v-ras(Ha) group, consistent with increased BrdU
incorporation detected by immunohistochemistry. The block in oncogene-induced
senescence corresponds to sustained levels of E2F1 and phosphorylated AKT, and is
associated with loss of induction of p16(ink4a)/p19(arf). The relevance of
p16(ink4a)/p19(arf) loss was demonstrated in grafting studies of p19(arf)-null
keratinocytes, which develop malignant carcinomas in the presence of v-ras(Ha)
similar to those arising in wildtype keratinocytes that express lenti-<U+0394>Np63a and 
v-ras(Ha). Our findings establish that <U+0394>Np63a has oncogenic activity and its
overexpression in human squamous cell carcinomas contributes to the malignant
phenotype, and implicate its ability to regulate p16(ink4a)/p19(arf) in the
process.

differentiating urothelial carcinoma from prostate carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Distinguishing urothelial carcinoma (UC) from prostate carcinoma (PC)
is important due to potential therapeutic and prognostic implications. However,
this can be a diagnostic challenge when there is limited tissue and in poorly
differentiated tumors. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of a dual
immunohistochemical stain comprising p63 and P501S (prostein), applied
sequentially on a single slide and visualized by double chromogen reaction, in
differentiating these two cancers. Thus far, there have been no previous studies 
assessing the diagnostic utility of p63 and P501S combined together as a dual
immunostain in distinguishing between these two cancers.
METHODS: p63/P501S dual-color sequential immunohistochemical staining was
performed on archival material from 132 patients with high-grade UC and 23
patients with PC, and evaluated for p63 (brown nuclear) and P501S (red
cytoplasmic) expression. Both the staining intensity and percentage of positive
tumor cells were assessed.
RESULTS: p63 was positive in 119/132 of UC and negative in PC. P501S was positive
in 22/23 of PC and negative in UC. The p63+/P501S- immunoprofile had 90%
sensitivity and 100% specificity for UC. The p63-/P501S+ immunoprofile had 96%
sensitivity and 100% specificity for PC.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that double sequential immunohistochemical
staining with p63 and P501S is highly specific and can be a useful tool in
distinguishing UC from PC especially when there is limited diagnostic tissue as
it can be performed on a single slide.

Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin is a malignant neuroendocrine tumour, whose
prognostic criteria are a matter of dispute. Specifically, no predictor is
presently available in stage I-II tumours. We collected clinical and follow-up
data from 70 Merkel cell carcinomas of the skin. The same cases were studied for 
p63 expression by immunohistochemistry, by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and
TP63 gene status by FISH and for presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus by PCR.
Stage emerged as a significant prognostic parameter (P=0.008). p63 expression,
detected in 61% (43/70) of cases by immunohistochemistry, was associated with
both decreased overall survival (P<0.0001) and disease-free survival (P<0.0001). 
Variable expression patterns of the different p63 isoforms were found only in
cases immunoreactive for p63. In these latter lesions, at least one of the
N-terminal p63 isoforms was detected and TAp63a was the most frequently expressed
isoform. TP63 gene amplification was observed by FISH in only one case. Presence 
of Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA sequences was detected in 86% (60/70) of Merkel
cell carcinomas and did not emerge as a significant prognostic parameter. Merkel 
cell carcinoma cases at low stage (stage I-II) represented over half (40/70
cases, 57%) of cases, and the clinical course was uneventful in 25 of 40 cases
while 15 cases died of tumour (10/40 cases) within 34 months or were alive with
disease (5/40 cases) within 20 months. Interestingly, a very strict correlation
was found between evolution and p63 expression (P<0.0001). The present data
indicate that p63 expression is associated with a worse prognosis in patients
with Merkel cell carcinoma, and in localised tumours it represents the single
independent predictor of clinical evolution.

p53 mutations, occurring in two-thirds of all human cancers, confer a gain of
function phenotype, including the ability to form metastasis, the determining
feature in the prognosis of most human cancer. This effect seems mediated at
least partially by its ability to physically interact with p63, thus affecting a 
cell invasion pathway, and accordingly, p63 is deregulated in human cancers. In
addition, p63, as an 'epithelial organizer', directly impinges on epidermal
mesenchimal transition, stemness, senescence, cell death and cell cycle arrest,
all determinant in cancer, and thus p63 affects chemosensitivity and
chemoresistance. This demonstrates an important role for p63 in cancer
development and its progression, and the aim of this review is to set this new
evidence that links p63 to metastasis within the context of the long conserved
other functions of p63.

Up-regulation of heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1) in human limbo-corneal
epithelial cells cultivated on amniotic membrane: A proteomic study.

Transplantation of cultivated human limbo-corneal epithelial (HLE) cells has been
recognized as an effective stem cell (SC) therapy for treating corneal epithelial
SC deficiency caused by burn or other diseases. With this technique,
cryo-preserved human intact amniotic membrane (IAM) has been successfully used as
a cell culture substrate and carrier, and is reported to preferentially preserve 
HLE stem/progenitor cells in vitro. However, little is known about what factors
released by HLE cells are involved in the progenitor cell-preserving mechanism.
Using proteomic method, we identified 13 proteins over-expressed by HLE cells
cultured on IAM, which included heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1), Hsp-27,
glutathione (GSH) S-transferase, annexin A2, galectin-7, and protein S100-A9.
Increased Hsp70-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot and real-time PCR. The
role of Hsp70-1 in promoting HLE cell survival was demonstrated by increased
apoptosis index and increased cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (CPARP)
formation in hsp70-1-silenced, but not normal HLE cells after exposure to
sublethal UVB irradiation or hydrogen peroxide. To understand the regulatory
mechanism of Hsp70-1 expression in HLE cells, the role of transcription factor
deltaNp63 (a well-recognized HLE stem cell; SC marker) was studied. We found that
over-expression of deltaNp63a by plasmid vector induced a corresponding increase 
in Hsp70-1 protein production. Likewise, Hsp70-1 expression decreased in HLE
cells after addition of deltaNp63a SiRNA. Immunoconfocal microscopy also revealed
a paralleled expression of both proteins in corneal specimens. Thus,
deltaNp63a-associated Hsp70-1 over-expression may promote HLE progenitor cell
survival on IAM, possibly through the cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effect of
Hsp70-1.

to the emergence of the trophectoderm and the pluripotent cells of the inner cell
mass. Using a double mRNA amplification technique and a comparison with
transcriptome data on pluripotent stem cells, placenta, germinal and adult
tissues, we report here some essential molecular features of the human mural
trophectoderm. In addition to genes known for their role in placenta (CGA, PGF,
ALPPL2 and ABCG2), human trophectoderm also strongly expressed Laminins, such as 
LAMA1, and the GAGE Cancer/Testis genes. The very high level of ABCG2 expression 
in trophectoderm, 7.9-fold higher than in placenta, suggests a major role of this
gene in shielding the very early embryo from xenobiotics. Several genes,
including CCKBR and DNMT3L, were specifically up-regulated only in trophectoderm,
indicating that the trophoblast cell lineage shares with the germinal lineage a
transient burst of DNMT3L expression. A trophectoderm core transcriptional
regulatory circuitry formed by 13 tightly interconnected transcription factors
(CEBPA, GATA2, GATA3, GCM1, KLF5, MAFK, MSX2, MXD1, PPARD, PPARG, PPP1R13L,
TFAP2C and TP63), was found to be induced in trophectoderm and maintained in
placenta. The induction of this network could be recapitulated in an in vitro
trophoblast differentiation model.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To identify 
genetic factors that modify the risk of lung cancer in individuals of Chinese
ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association scan in 5,408 subjects (2,331
individuals with lung cancer (cases) and 3,077 controls) followed by a two-stage 
validation among 12,722 subjects (6,313 cases and 6,409 controls). The combined
analyses identified six well-replicated SNPs with independent effects and
significant lung cancer associations (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) located in TP63
(rs4488809 at 3q28, P = 7.2 × 10(-26)), TERT-CLPTM1L (rs465498 and rs2736100 at
5p15.33, P = 1.2 × 10(-20) and P = 1.0 × 10(-27), respectively), MIPEP-TNFRSF19
(rs753955 at 13q12.12, P = 1.5 × 10(-12)) and MTMR3-HORMAD2-LIF (rs17728461 and
rs36600 at 22q12.2, P = 1.1 × 10(-11) and P = 6.2 × 10(-13), respectively). Two
of these loci (13q12.12 and 22q12.2) were newly identified in the Chinese
population. These results suggest that genetic variants in 3q28, 5p15.33,
13q12.12 and 22q12.2 may contribute to the susceptibility of lung cancer in Han
Chinese.

BACKGROUND: Appropriate treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) depended
on histologic type. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels
of Napsin A, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and p63 by immunostaining
using CytoRich Red preserved cytocentrifuged bronchial brushings.
METHODS: The expression levels of Napsin A, TTF-1, and p63 were
semiquantitatively evaluated using proportion and intensity scores in 12 patients
from whom both bronchial brushing cytology and bronchial biopsy samples had been 
obtained, as well as in a selection of 64 resected NSCLC tissue samples, and 8
normal or benign bronchial brushing cytology samples.
RESULTS: The nuclear expressions of TTF-1 and p63 allowed for good visualization 
of cancer cells, whereas the cytoplasmic expression of Napsin A in cancer cells
was often more difficult to evaluate because medium-sized and large macrophages
also expressed Napsin A. Napsin A and TTF-1 were reliable adenocarcinoma markers,
and p63 was a reliable squamous cell carcinoma marker in cytology, and histology 
samples. The average scores of Napsin A, TTF-1, and p63 were highly correlated in
bronchial brushing cytology and bronchial biopsy samples, whereas TTF-1
expression was significantly lower than Napsin A expression in resected NSCLC
tissue samples (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Immunostaining of bronchial brushings fixed with CytoRich Red was
useful in determining histologic types in NSCLC. It was suggested that the panels
of Napsin A, TTF-1, and p63 were effective in identifying histologic type in
NSCLC, and that a combination of either Napsin A and p63 or TTF-1 and p63 should 
be chosen, depending on morphology.

The p53-related transcription factor p63 is critically important for basic
cellular functions during development of the ectoderm and derived structure and
tissues, including skin, limb, palate, and hair. On the one side, p63 is required
to sustain the proliferation of keratinocyte progenitors, while on the other side
it is required for cell stratification, commitment to differentiate, cell
adhesion, and epithelial-mesenchymal signaling. Molecules that are components or 
regulators of the p63 pathway(s) are rapidly being identified, and it comes with 
no surprise that alterations in the p63 pathway lead to congenital conditions in 
which the skin and other ectoderm-derived structures are affected. In this paper,
we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular and cellular regulations
centered on p63, derived from the comprehension of p63-linked human diseases and 
the corresponding animal models, as well as from cellular models and
high-throughput molecular approaches. We point out common themes and features,
that allow to speculate on the possible role of p63 downstream events and their
potential exploitation in future attempts to correct the congenital defect in
preclinical studies.

AIMS: Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) is currently considered to provide 
better staging of regional metastasis. For rapid and accurate sentinel lymph node
analysis, one-step nucleic acid amplification using cytokeratin 19 (CK19) has
been applied, particularly in breast cancer. On the other hand, additional
quantitative reverse transcription PCR targets containing cytokeratins have been 
reported recently in head and neck cancer. In this report, CK19 and p63 were
immunohistochemically examined in primary tumours for use as molecular markers
and were compared with cytokeratin 903 (CK903), cytokeratin 8/18 (CK8/18) and
cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), which are used in diagnostic immunohistochemistry for head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: The study reviewed 17 patients with T1/T2, N0 (UICC) oral squamous cell 
carcinoma of the tongue who were treated surgically at Kyorin University Hospital
between 2002 and 2009. The intensity and proportion of tumour cells stained for
CK19, CK903, p63, CK8/18 and AE1/AE3 were evaluated.
RESULTS: CK19 and CK8/18 staining in cytoplasm was patchy among carcinoma cells, 
indicating weak expression. Staining proportion for p63, CK903 and AE1/AE3 was
greater than for CK19 and CK8/18, although staining intensity for CK903 was
weaker than for p63 and AE1/AE3. The difference in total score between CK19 and
CK8/18 staining and p63, CK903 and AE1/AE3 staining was statistically significant
(p<0.001). p63 and AE1/AE3 may be better markers than CK903, CK19 and CK8/18.
CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that p63 is of clinical utility in SNNS and that CK19 
is unsuitable for early tongue carcinoma. Further studies are needed before
clinical application of these markers.

The TP63 gene, a TP53 homologue, encodes for two main isoforms by different
promoters: one retains (TA) and the other lacks (<U+0394>N) the transactivation domain. 
p63 plays a critical role in the maintenance of basal and myoepithelial cells in 
ectodermally derived tissues and is implicated in tumorigenesis of several
neoplastic entities. However, the biological and regulatory roles of these
isoforms in salivary gland tumorigenesis remain unknown. Our results show a
reciprocal expression between TA and <U+0394>N isoforms in both benign and malignant
salivary tumors. The most dominantly expressed were the <U+0394>N isoforms, whereas the 
TA isoforms showed generally low levels of expression, except in a few tumors.
High <U+0394>Np63 expression characterized tumors with aggressive behavior, whereas
tumors with high TAp63 expression were significantly smaller and less aggressive.
In salivary gland cells, high expression of <U+0394>Np63 led to enhanced cell migration 
and invasion and suppression of cell senescence independent of TAp63 and/or TP53 
gene status. We conclude the following: i) overexpression of <U+0394>Np63 contributes to
salivary tumorigenesis, ii) <U+0394>Np63 plays a dominant negative effect on the TA
isoform in the modulation of cell migration and invasion, and iii) the <U+0394>N isoform
plays an oncogenic role and may represent an attractive target for therapeutic
intervention in patients with salivary carcinomas.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expressions of p53 pathway
genes and EZH2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: The expression levels of p53, mdm2, p63 and EZH2 proteins were detected 
by immunohistochemistry in 47 cases of undifferentiated NPC and 12 cases of
chronic nasopharyngitis, and their correlation to the clinical parameters and
prognosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: The protein expressions of p53, mdm2, p63 and EZH2 in NPC were 31.9%,
85.1%, and 95.7%, respectively. mdm2 and EZH2 was not correlated to p53 protein
expression (P>0.05); positive correlations was found between EZH2 and p63
expressions and between p53 and p63. The high expression of EZH2 and p63 proteins
was correlated to advanced T stage and clinical stage of NPC (P<0.05). The
five-year disease-free survival rate in patients with high EZH2 protein
expression was significantly lower than that in patients with low EZH2
expression.
CONCLUSION: mdm2 does not show an obvious correlation to p53 protein inactivation
in NPC. p63 protein overexpression may be associated with p53 protein
inactivation. The overexpression of EZH2 is correlated to NPC progression and
poor prognosis.

PURPOSE: To examine the expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA4) 
in the epithelium of the human ocular surface and characterize SSEA4(+) and
SSEA4(-) limbal epithelial cells.
METHODS: SSEA4 expression in the human cornea and limbus was examined by RT-PCR
and immunohistochemistry. SSEA4(+) and SSEA4(-) cells were then separated by
using magnetic beads. The phenotypes of these two cell populations were evaluated
on the basis of cell size, clonogenic assay, and expression of putative limbal
stem cell (LSC) and corneal epithelial differentiation markers.
RESULTS: SSEA4 was expressed in all layers of the corneal and anterior limbal
epithelia. Discrete clusters of SSEA4(+) cells were present in the central and
posterior limbal epithelia. SSEA4(+) cells accounted for an average of 40% of the
total limbal epithelial cells. The SSEA4(-) population contained five times more 
small cells (=11 µm in diameter) than did the SSEA4(+) population. The expression
levels of the putative LSC markers ABCG2, <U+0394>Np63a, and cytokeratin (K)14 were
significantly higher in the SSEA4(-) population than in the SSEA4(+) population. 
The SSEA4(-) cells also expressed a significantly higher level of N-cadherin, but
a lower level of the differentiation marker K12. The colony-forming efficiency in
the SSEA4(-) population was 25.2% (P = 0.04) and 1.6-fold (P < 0.05) higher than 
in the unsorted population and the SSEA4(+) population, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: SSEA4 is highly expressed in differentiated corneal epithelial
cells, and SSEA4(-) limbal epithelial cells contain a higher proportion of limbal
stem/progenitor cells. SSEA4 could be used as a negative marker to enrich the
isolation of LSCs.

Expression of p63, a putative marker for epithelial or myoepithelial
differentiation, has been used to distinguish spindle cell carcinoma from
sarcoma. The specificity of p63 for epithelial differentiation has not been
thoroughly evaluated however, since p63 expression has been explored in only a
handful of mesenchymal tumors. After observing unexpected immunohistochemical
staining for p63 in an angiosarcoma of the breast, we evaluated a series of
benign and malignant vascular tumors to determine the frequency of such a
finding. Nuclear immunoreactivity to p63 was detected, at least focally, in 24%
of malignant vascular tumors other than Kaposi sarcoma, which was uniformly
negative. Benign vascular tumors were also negative for p63. Although p63
expression in tumors of vascular differentiation is unusual, it may be seen
occasionally in some malignant vascular tumors. Thus, p63 is not entirely
specific for epithelial differentiation. Since soft tissue angiosarcomas and
hemangioendotheliomas sometimes express cytokeratins, the finding of nuclear p63 
represents another potential pitfall in the differential diagnosis between
poorly-differentiated carcinomas and vascular neoplasms.

Tp63 in oral development, neoplasia, and autoimmunity.

NY, USA.

The Tp63 gene encodes for multiple isoforms of the p63 transcription factor, a
member of the p53 family of proteins. Much like its more famous sibling, the
biological role of p63 is quite complex, with wide-ranging effects on
development, differentiation, and cellular lineage choices. The crucial function 
of p63 is epitomized by the striking phenotype of p63 knockout mice. These
animals have a profound block in the development of stratified epithelia and
aplasia of multiple ectodermal appendages, as well as orofacial clefting and limb
defects. Remarkably, a similar spectrum of phenotypic alterations is observed in 
human syndromes resulting from Tp63 gene mutations. p63 is an important hub in
the transcriptional and signaling networks of epithelial cells; thus, it is not
surprising that dysregulation of this transcription factor is associated with
squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, as a testament to the growing repertoire of
p63-associated diseases, autoantibodies to p63 are associated with chronic
ulcerative stomatitis, an oral immunologically mediated disease. Over the past
decade, our understanding of the broad biologic and pathophysiological roles of
p63 has grown significantly. In this review, we discuss the molecular attributes 
of Tp63 and the clinical consequences of Tp63 dysregulation, particularly as it
pertains to oral tissues.

The <U+0394>Np63 protein, a product of the TP63 gene that lacks the N-terminal domain,
has a critical role in the maintenance of self renewal and progenitor capacity in
several types of epithelial tissues. <U+0394>Np63 is frequently overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in some other epithelial tumours. This
overexpression may contribute to tumour progression through dominant-negative
effects on the transcriptionally active (TA) isoforms of the p53 family (TAp63,
TAp73 and p53), as well as through independent mechanisms. However, the molecular
basis of <U+0394>Np63 overexpression is not fully understood. Here, we show that the
expression of <U+0394>Np63 is regulated by the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway in human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and SCC cell lines. This regulation operates in
particular through TCF/LEF sites present in the P2 promoter of TP63. In addition,
we show that <U+0394>Np63 and ß-catenin are frequently coexpressed and accumulated in
oesophageal SCC, but not in HCC. These results suggest that activation of the
ß-catenin pathway may contribute to overexpression of <U+0394>Np63 during tumour
progression, in a cell type-specific manner.

<U+0394>Np63a regulates keratinocyte proliferation by controlling PTEN expression and
localization.

<U+0394>Np63a, implicated as an oncogene, is upregulated by activated Akt, part of a
well-known cell survival pathway. Inhibition of Akt activation by phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and the presence of putative
p63-binding sites in the pten promoter led us to investigate whether <U+0394>Np63a
regulates PTEN expression. Knockdown of <U+0394>Np63a led to increases in PTEN levels
and loss of activated Akt, while overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a decreased PTEN levels
and elevated active Akt. The repression of PTEN by <U+0394>Np63a occurs independently of
p53 status, as loss of <U+0394>Np63a increases PTEN expression in cell lines with and
without functional p53. In addition, decreased levels of <U+0394>Np63a resulted in an
increase in nuclear PTEN. Conversely, in vivo nuclear PTEN was absent in the
proliferative basal layer of the epidermis where <U+0394>Np63a expression is highest.
Additionally, we show that in keratinocytes a balance between <U+0394>Np63a and PTEN
regulates Akt activation and maintains normal proliferation rates. This balance
is disrupted in non-melanoma skin cancers through increased <U+0394>Np63a levels, and
could enhance proliferation and subsequent neoplastic development. Our studies
show that <U+0394>Np63a negatively regulates PTEN, thereby providing a feedback loop
between PTEN, Akt and <U+0394>Np63a, which has an integral role in skin cancer
development.

PURPOSE: As a member of the p53 family, p63 is considered to be an important
differentiation regulation transcriptional factor, but the roles of p63 in many
epithelial tumourigenesis and metastasis processes are still not clear. This
study was designed to investigate the expression of p63 and its isoform in normal
tissues and squamous cell cancer tissues of uterine cervix, and its significance 
in cancer cell differentiation.
METHODS: The expression of p63 was assessed in cervical tissue and cell lines by 
immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and Western Blotting. The relationships between p63 
protein, various clinico-pathological features, and the differentiation marker
involucrin were analyzed.
RESULTS: <U+0394><U+039D>p63a is the predominant isoform expressed in cervical epithelial
tissues, and it is decreased in moderately or poorly differentiated cervical
squamous carcinoma, as well as in the HeLa, SiHa and C33A cervical cancer cell
lines. The expression level of <U+0394><U+039D>p63a was positively correlated with that of
involucrin in cervical squamous cancer tissue, and the expression of <U+0394><U+039D>p63a is
decreased with the degree of tumour invasion.
CONCLUSION: The decrease of <U+0394><U+039D>p63a in cervical squamous cell cancer appears to be
associated with the tumour progression, and <U+0394><U+039D>p63a may be a sensitive marker for 
cervical squamous cancer differentiation.

CONTEXT: Previous studies have demonstrated p63 overexpression in giant cell
tumors of bone and advocate its use as a potential diagnostic marker. Although
routine histology is often all that is required to diagnose giant cell tumor of
bone, immunohistochemistry could prove useful to distinguish it from other benign
and malignant giant cell-containing lesions of bone and soft tissue on needle
biopsies and unusual clinical settings.
OBJECTIVE: To assess p63 expression in giant cell-containing lesions of bone and 
soft tissue.
DESIGN: p63 immunohistochemistry was performed in 23 giant cell tumors of bone, 8
primary aneurysmal bone cysts, 12 chondroblastomas, 4 giant cell reparative
granulomas, 4 osteosarcomas, 15 tenosynovial giant cell tumors, 6 nonossifying
fibromas, and 4 pigmented villonodular synovitides.
RESULTS: p63 overexpression was identified in 20 of 23 giant cell tumors of bone 
(86.9%), 5 of 8 primary aneurysmal bone cysts (62.5%), 10 of 12 chondroblastomas 
(83.3%), 4 of 4 giant cell reparative granulomas (100%), 2 of 4 osteosarcomas
(50%), 1 of 15 tenosynovial giant cell tumors (6.6%), 1 of 6 nonossifying
fibromas (16.6%), and 1 of 4 pigmented villonodular synovitides (25%). The
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value of p63 immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of giant cell tumor of bone
were 86.95%, 53.36%, 45.45%, and 91.17%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that although p63 is expressed by most giant cell
tumors of bone, its lack of specificity limits its use as an immunohistochemical 
marker in the differential diagnosis of giant cell-containing lesions of bone and
soft tissue.

TP63, a member of the TP53 gene family, is a nuclear marker of myoepithelial
cells. Antibody against p63 is frequently used to aid in the diagnosis of
prostate carcinoma, as well as in the identification of myoepithelial cells in
other tissues including the breast. p63 is also a marker for squamous cell
carcinoma. Recently, it was found that all p53 family members are involved in
regulating the process of muscle differentiation through the retinoblastoma (RB) 
protein. Ablation of these p53 family functions blocks the differentiation
program and promotes malignant transformation by enabling cooperating oncogenes
to transform myoblasts. We therefore studied p63 expression in a number of
neoplasms with myogenic differentiation. Immunohistochemical staining for p63 was
performed on paraffin sections from 38 rhabdomyosarcomas, five leiomyomas, five
leiomyosarcomas, five rhabdomyomas, five rhabdomyomatous Wilms tumors, three
normal cardiac muscles, one medullomyoblastoma, one pleuropulmonary blastoma with
rhabdomyomatous differentiation, and one teratoma with prominent rhabdomyoblasts.
Each case was also stained with desmin. Unlike the nuclear staining scored in
myoepithelial cells, only cytoplasmic staining for p63 was considered positive.
Of 38 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, 36 showed cytoplasmic p63 staining; 24 of these 
showed highlighting of cross-striations superior to that of desmin. In addition, 
5/5 rhabdomyomas, 5/5 rhabdomyomatous Wilms tumors, 1/1 pleuropulmonary blastoma 
with rhabdomyomatous differentiation, 1/1 teratoma with atypical rhabdoblasts,
and 1/1 medullomyoblastoma exhibited cytoplasmic p63 staining. Normal cardiac
muscle samples (3/3) also demonstrated positive cytoplasmic staining and distinct
cross-striations. Smooth muscle tumors exhibited only very focal and faint
cytoplasmic staining in 5/5 leiomyomas and 4/5 leiomyosarcomas. Immunoelectron
microscopic study of skeletal muscle showed p63 localization to the Z bands of
sarcomeres. We conclude that p63 immunostain is a sensitive marker for skeletal
muscle differentiation and highlights the cross-striations of strap cells with
exceptional definition.

Immunohistochemistry is increasingly utilized to differentiate lung
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. However, detailed analysis of
coexpression profiles of commonly used markers in large series of whole-tissue
sections is lacking. Furthermore, the optimal diagnostic algorithm, particularly 
the minimal-marker combination, is not firmly established. We therefore studied
whole-tissue sections of resected adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma
(n=315) with markers commonly used to identify adenocarcinoma (TTF-1) and
squamous cell carcinoma (p63, CK5/6, 34ßE12), and prospectively validated the
devised algorithm in morphologically unclassifiable small biopsy/cytology
specimens (n=38). Analysis of whole-tissue sections showed that squamous cell
carcinoma had a highly consistent immunoprofile (TTF-1-negative and
p63/CK5/6/34ßE12-diffuse) with only rare variation. In contrast, adenocarcinoma
showed significant immunoheterogenetity for all 'squamous markers' (p63 (32%),
CK5/6 (18%), 34ßE12 (82%)) and TTF-1 (89%). As a single marker, only diffuse
TTF-1 was specific for adenocarcinoma whereas none of the 'squamous markers,'
even if diffuse, were entirely specific for squamous cell carcinoma. In contrast,
coexpression profiles of TTF-1/p63 had only minimal overlap between
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and there was no overlap if CK5/6 was
added as a third marker. An algorithm was devised in which TTF-1/p63 were used as
the first-line panel, and CK5/6 was added for rare indeterminate cases.
Prospective validation of this algorithm in small specimens showed 100% accuracy 
of adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma prediction as determined by
subsequent resection. In conclusion, although reactivity for 'squamous markers'
is common in lung adenocarcinoma, a two-marker panel of TTF-1/p63 is sufficient
for subtyping of the majority of tumors as adenocarcinomas vs squamous cell
carcinoma, and addition of CK5/6 is needed in only a small subset of cases. This 
simple algorithm achieves excellent accuracy in small specimens while conserving 
the tissue for potential predictive marker testing, which is now an essential
consideration in advanced lung cancer specimens.

Diagnosis of limited cancer can be challenging in prostate needle biopsies, and
immunohistochemistry is commonly used in such settings. Recently, TMPRSS2:ERG
gene rearrangement was found to be highly specific for and detected in
approximately 50% of prostate cancer. Positive immunohistochemical staining with 
a novel anti-ERG antibody highly correlated with TMPRSS2:ERG gene rearrangement
status. We developed a double immunohistochemical staining containing both
erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogen (ERG) and basal cell marker P63 antibodies and
evaluated its use in the diagnosis of limited cancer in prostate needle biopsies.
A total of 77 prostate needle biopsies containing cancer occupying <1 mm of the
length of only 1 core of the entire biopsy set were stained with the double stain
containing ERG and P63 antibodies. ERG positivity and its staining intensity in
cancerous and other noncancerous lesions were evaluated. ERG expression was
detected in 42% (32 of 77) of cases, with strong, moderate, and weak staining
intensity in 72%, 16%, and 12% of cases. The staining was uniform in 84% of cases
and heterogeneous in 16% of cases with different staining intensities in >10% of 
cancerous cells. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was present in 17
cases, and in 5 (29%) cases ERG was positive in high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia glands, which were all immediately adjacent to or
intermingled with ERG-positive cancerous glands. In 4 additional cases, positive 
ERG staining was found in morphologically benign glands, which were also
immediately adjacent to or intermingled with ERG-positive cancerous glands. All
other benign lesions distant from cancerous glands, including simple and partial 
atrophy, were negative for ERG. P63 was negative in all cancerous glands and
positive in noncancerous lesions. The P63/ERG double immunostain combines the
high sensitivity of P63 and the high specificity of ERG and may be potentially
useful in the work-up of difficult prostate biopsies. The high specificity of ERG
for the presence of cancer may have important implications for prostate biopsy
interpretation and needs to be further validated in larger prospective studies.

p63 is a member of the p53 tumour suppressor family that includes p73. The p63
gene encodes a protein comprising an N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA
binding domain and an oligomerization domain, but varies in the organization of
the C-terminus as a result of complex alternative splicing. p63a contains a
C-terminal sterile a motif (SAM) domain that is thought to function as a
protein-protein interaction domain. Several missense and heterozygous frame shift
mutations, encoded within exon 13 and 14 of the p63 gene, have been identified in
the p63a SAM domain in patients suffering from ankyloblepharon-ectodermal
dysplasia-clefting syndrome. Here we report the solution and high resolution
crystal structures of the p63a SAM domain and investigate the effect of several
mutations (L553F/V, C562G/W, G569V, Q575L and I576T) on the stability of the
domain. The possible effects of other mutations are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Variation at TP63 has recently been shown to be associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma in the Asian population.
METHODS: To investigate how this finding translates to the European population we
compared the genotypes of SNPs annotating the TP63 locus at 3q28 in 4,462 lung
cancer patients, including 911 with adenocarcinoma, and 8,235 controls from the
United Kingdom.
RESULTS: A statistically significant association between adenocarcinoma risk and 
SNP genotype was shown: rs10937405, OR = 1.21, P = 1.82 × 10(-4); rs17429138, OR 
= 1.23, P = 7.49 × 10(-5); and rs4396880, OR = 1.21, P = 2.03 × 10(-4). Haplotype
analysis was consistent with a single TP63 risk locus defined by SNPs rs10937405,
rs17429138, and rs4396880. While no association between SNPs and small cell lung 
cancer was shown, the rs10937405 and rs439680 associations were significant for
squamous cancer (respective P-values, 0.0022 and 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show TP63 variation is a risk factor for the
development of lung adenocarcinoma in the UK population. Furthermore, they
provide additional insight into the subtype-specificity of the 3q28 lung cancer
association.
IMPACT: Our data confirm the association of 3q28 with lung adenocarcinoma and
that this association is not confined to the Asian population. Elucidating the
functional basis of this association will be contingent on future fine mapping of
the TP63 loci.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and many other epithelial
malignancies exhibit increased proliferation, invasion, and inflammation,
concomitant with aberrant nuclear activation of TP53 and NF-<U+03BA>B family members
<U+0394>Np63, cRel, and RelA. However, the mechanisms of cross-talk by which these
transcription factors coordinate gene expression and the malignant phenotype
remain elusive. In this study, we showed that <U+0394>Np63 regulates a cohort of genes
involved in cell growth, survival, adhesion, and inflammation, which
substantially overlaps with the NF-<U+03BA>B transcriptome. <U+0394>Np63 with cRel and/or RelA 
are recruited to form novel binding complexes on p63 or NF-<U+03BA>B/Rel sites of
multitarget gene promoters. Overexpressed <U+0394>Np63- or TNF-a-induced NF-<U+03BA>B and
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) reporter activation depended on
RelA/cRel regulatory binding sites. Depletion of RelA or <U+0394>Np63 by small
interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly inhibited NF-<U+03BA>B-specific, or TNF-a-induced 
IL-8 reporter activation. <U+0394>Np63 siRNA significantly inhibited proliferation,
survival, and migration by HNSCC cells in vitro. Consistent with these data, an
increase in nuclear <U+0394>Np63, accompanied by increased proliferation (Ki-67) and
adhesion (ß4 integrin) markers, and induced inflammatory cell infiltration was
observed throughout HNSCC specimens, when compared with the basilar pattern of
protein expression and minimal inflammation seen in nonmalignant mucosa.
Furthermore, overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a in squamous epithelial cells in transgenic 
mice leads to increased suprabasilar cRel, Ki-67, and cytokine expression,
together with epidermal hyperplasia and diffuse inflammation, similar to HNSCC.
Our study reveals <U+0394>Np63 as a master transcription factor that, in coordination
with NF-<U+03BA>B/Rels, orchestrates a broad gene program promoting epidermal
hyperplasia, inflammation, and the malignant phenotype of HNSCC.

Mutations in sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of TP63 have been reported to be
associated with ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate syndrome
and Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. SAM domain, a protein-protein interaction module, is
found in cytoplasmic signaling proteins and several transcriptional regulatory
proteins which are involved in development and differentiation. Here, we report
on a SAM domain mutation (p.Asp564His) in TP63 that predisposed the patients to
have nonsyndromic cleft palate and nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate.

Non-hominid TP63 lacks retroviral LTRs but contains a novel conserved upstream
exon.

We have recently identified novel isoforms of human p63, with specific expression
in testicular germ cells. The synthesis of these p63 mRNA species is driven by
the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the endogenous retrovirus ERV9. This LTR was
inserted upstream of the previously known TP63 exons roughly 15 million years
ago, leading to the expression of novel exons and the synthesis of
germline-specific transactivating p63 (GTAp63) isoforms in humans and great apes 
(Beyer et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2011; 108:3624-9). However, this study did
not reveal whether similar upstream exons can also be found in the TP63 genes of 
non-hominid animals. Here we performed rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to
identify a novel upstream exon of murine TP63, located in the 5' position from
the previously described start of transcription. This exon, termed "exon U3" in
our previous publication, is conserved within a broad range of mammalian species,
including hominids. However, in contrast to the human TP63 gene structure, the
murine exon U3 represented the most upstream transcribed sequence of TP63. Murine
exon U3 is then alternatively spliced to acceptor sites within exon 1 or upstream
of exon 2, resulting in two different available translational start sites. p63
mRNAs comprising exon U3 are detectable in various tissues, with no particular
preference for testicular cells. Thus, whereas the retroviral LTR in hominid
species results in strictly germline-associated p63 isoforms, the upstream exon
in non-hominids fails to confer this tissue specificity. This notion strongly
supports the concept that the synthesis of a testis-specific p63 isoform is a
recently acquired, unique feature of humans and great apes.

OBJECTIVE: To find out the immunohistochemical assessment of p63 expression in
odontogenic cysts based on the differences among their clinical behaviors.
METHODS: This study was carried out on 34 archival paraffin-embedded specimens of
odontogenic cysts. We obtained the specimens from the Pathology Department of
Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran from March 2003 to February
2008. The specimens comprised 12 dentigerous cysts, 9 radicular cysts, and 13
keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). The immunohistochemical technique was
performed using the Envision system for evaluation of p63 expression.
RESULTS: The KCOT revealed the highest p63 expression and the differences between
the 3 groups was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: P63 expression might be helpful when identifying cyst types with more
aggressive and invasive phenotype.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a treatment-refractory subtype of human cancer
arising from stratified epithelium of the skin, lung, esophagus, oropharynx, and 
other tissues. A unifying feature of SCC is high-level expression of the
p53-related protein p63 (TP63) in 80% of cases. The major protein isoform of p63 
expressed in SCC is <U+0394>Np63a, an N-terminally truncated form which functions as a
key SCC cell survival factor by mechanisms that are unclear. In this study, we
show that <U+0394>Np63a associates with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2 to form 
an active transcriptional repressor complex that can be targeted to therapeutic
advantage. Repression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member genes including p53
upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) by p63/HDAC is required for survival of
SCC cells. Cisplatin chemotherapy, a mainstay of SCC treatment, promotes
dissociation of p63 and HDAC from the PUMA promoter, leading to increased histone
acetylation, PUMA activation, and apoptosis. These effects are recapitulated upon
targeting the p63/HDAC complex selectively with class I/II HDAC inhibitors using 
both in vitro and in vivo models. Sensitivity to HDAC inhibition is directly
correlated with p63 expression and is abrogated in tumor cells that overexpress
endogenous Bcl-2. Together, our results elucidate a mechanism of p63-mediated
transcriptional repression and they identify the <U+0394>Np63a/HDAC complex as an
essential tumor maintenance factor in SCC. In addition, our findings offer a
rationale to apply HDAC inhibitors for SCC treatment.

The homeodomain transcription factors play crucial roles in many developmental
processes ranging from organization of the body plan to differentiation of
individual tissues. The homeodomain protein Distal-less-3 (DLX3) has an essential
role in epidermal stratification and development of ectodermal appendages,
placenta and bones. A four-nucleotide deletion in the human DLX3 gene is
etiologic for the human hereditary tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) ectodermal
dysplasia, a dominant syndrome characterized by abnormalities in hair, nails,
teeth, and bones. We have previously demonstrated that DLX3 gene expression
induces degradation of <U+0394>Np63a, a specific product of the TP63 gene, a master
regulator of multi-layered epithelia. Here we show that the DLX3(TDO) mutant
protein is unable to promote <U+0394>Np63a protein degradation and impairs the
expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and skin differentiation markers.
However, we found that in cell expressing equal amounts of mutant and wild-type
DLX3, <U+0394>Np63a protein level is efficiently regulated implying that genetic
heterozygosity at the DLX3 locus protects TDO patients from developing severe
p63-associated skin defects.

Since their initial identification p53 homologues p63 and p73 have been expected 
to play a role in cancer development due to their close homology to p53,
notoriously one of the most mutated genes in cancer. However soon after their
discovery the awareness that these genes were rarely mutated in cancer seemed to 
indicate that they did not play a role in its development. However a large number
of data collected in the following years indicated that altered expression rather
than mutation could be found in different neoplasia and play a role in its
biology. In particular p63 due to its fundamental role in epithelial development 
seems to play a role in a number of tumors of epithelial origin. In this review
we summarize some of the evidence linking p63 to carcinogenesis.

INTRODUCTION: More detailed typing of non-small cell lung cancer on small biopsy 
specimens is increasingly required, albeit sometimes demanding with morphology
alone. Little, however, is known about the likelihood of immunohistochemistry
(IHC)-assessed small biopsies to effectively parallel profiling and, hence,
eventual diagnoses of surgical specimens.
METHODS: Sixty-three preoperative biopsies and the corresponding surgical
specimens from 30 consecutive squamous cell carcinomas, 22 adenocarcinomas, 2
adenosquamous carcinomas, eight sarcomatoid carcinomas, and one yolk sac tumor
were jointly evaluated semiquantitatively for cytokeratins 5/6 and 7, p63,
thyroid transcription factor-1, and vimentin immunoreactivity. Surgical specimens
were the gold standard for morphology and IHC.
RESULTS: Hierarchic clustering analysis of both surgical specimens and biopsies
showed a nonrandom and overlapping distribution of the relevant markers, which
closely correlated with each other and the diverse tumor categories, as confirmed
by mosaic plot analysis. There were no differences in area under the
curve-receiver operating characteristic curves for each marker between any two
samples, with the exception of p63 that paralleled more effectively squamous cell
carcinoma on biopsies than surgical specimens. Fifty-nine of 63 (94%) lesions
were correctly classified by IHC on biopsy compared with 53 of 63 (84%) by
revised morphology, with the predictive positive value being 97% for squamous
cell carcinoma, 88% for adenocarcinoma, and 100% for sarcomatoid and
adenosquamous carcinoma. Yolk sac tumor and three of eight sarcomatoid
carcinomas, however, failed any diagnostic recognition.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse cell differentiation lineages of non-small cell lung cancer 
may be consistently detected by IHC in small biopsies, making the eventual typing
of tumors effective in most cases.

p63 is a master regulator of proliferation and differentiation in stratifying
epithelia, and its expression is frequently altered in carcinogenesis. However,
its role in maintaining proliferative capacity remains unclear. Here, we
demonstrate that hypoproliferation and loss of differentiation in organotypic
raft cultures of primary neonatal human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) depleted of
the a and ß isoforms of p63 result from p53-p21-mediated accumulation of
retinoblastoma (Rb) family member p130. Hypoproliferation in p63-depleted HFKs
can be rescued by depletion of p53, p21(CIP1) or p130. Furthermore, we identified
the gene encoding S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), the recognition
component of the SCF(Skp2) E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel target of p63,
potentially influencing p130 levels. Expression of Skp2 is maintained by p63
binding to a site in intron 2 and mRNA levels are downregulated in p63-depleted
cells. Hypoproliferation in p63-depleted cells can be restored by re-expression
of Skp2. Taken together, these results indicate that p63 plays a multifaceted
role in maintaining proliferation in the mature regenerating epidermis, in
addition to being required for differentiation.

[The coordinated interaction of multifunctional members of p53 family determines 
many key processes in multicellular organisms].

Vilgelm AE, Zaika AI, Prasolov VS.

First time p53 was found in the complex with viral large T-antigene in the cells 
transformed by small DNA virus SV40. The cloning of p53 cDNA was done in the
beginning of eighties and soon after that the whole p53 gene was cloned. The p53 
family is comprised of three genes: TP53,TP63 and TP73, each of which is
expressed as a set of structurally and functionally different isoforms. All of
them intensively interact with each other forming a united functional network of 
proteins. In this review we discuss evolution of the p53 family and significance 
of all its members in embryonic development, reproduction, regeneration,
regulation of aging and life span, as well as in the body's defense against
cancer. With special attention we review the role of less studied members of the 
p53 family: p63 and p73, in oncogenesis and tumor progression and show that
different isoforms of these proteins might exert a contrary effect on these
processes.

Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is characterized by underdeveloped or absent 
central digital rays, clefts of hands and feet, and variable syndactyly of the
remaining digits. SHFM is a heterogeneous condition caused by abnormalities at
one of multiple loci, including SHFM1 (SHFM1 at 7q21-q22), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3
(FBXW4/DACTYLIN at 10q24), SHFM4 (TP63 at 3q27), and SHFM5 (DLX1 and DLX 2 at
2q31). SHFM3 is unique in that it is caused by submicroscopic tandem chromosome
duplications of FBXW4/DACTYLIN. In order to show that array-based comparative
genomic hybridization should be considered an essential aspect of the genetic
analysis of patients with SHFM, we report on a family with two brothers who have 
ectrodactyly. Interestingly, both also have ocular abnormalities. Their sister
and both parents are healthy. DNA of all five family members was analyzed using
oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray and quantitative PCR. The two affected
brothers were found to have a small duplication of approximately 539 kb at
10q24.32. The patients' sister and father do not have the microduplication, but
qPCR showed that mother's DNA carries the duplication in 20% of blood
lymphocytes. In this family, two children were affected with ectrodactyly having 
a duplication over the SHFM3 locus. The mother, who shows no clinical features of
ectrodacytyly, is a mosaic for the same duplication. Therefore, we demonstrate
that somatic/gonadal mosaicism is a mechanism that gives rise to SHFM. We also
suggest that ocular abnormalities may be part of the clinical description of
SHFM3.

The inhibitor of DNA binding 2, dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein, ID2, 
acts as an oncogene and elevated levels of ID2 have been reported in several
malignancies. Whereas some inducers of the ID2 gene have been characterized,
little is known regarding the proteins capable to repress its expression. We
developed siRNA microarrays to perform a large scale loss-of-function screen in
human adult keratinocytes engineered to express GFP under the control of the
upstream region of ID2 gene. We screened the effect of siRNA-dependent inhibition
of 220 cancer-associated genes on the expression of the ID2::GFP reporter
construct. Three genes NBN, RAD21, and p63 lead to a repression of ID2 promoter
activity. Strikingly NBN and RAD21 are playing on major role in cell cycle
progression and mitosis arrest. These results underline the pregnant need to
silence ID2 expression at transcript level to promote cell cycle exit. Central to
this inhibitory mechanism we find p63, a key transcription factor in epithelial
development and differentiation, which binds specific cis-acting sequence within 
the ID2 gene promoter both in vitro and in vivo. P63 would not suppress ID2
expression, but would rather prevent excessive expression of that protein to
enable the onset of keratinocyte differentiation.

Transcription factor p63, a p53 family member, plays a role in epithelial cell
development, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Point mutations,
primarily in the DNA binding domain (p63DBD), lead to malformation syndromes. To 
gain insight into differences between p63 and p53 and the impact of mutations on 
the structure, we have determined two crystal structures of p63DBD in complex
with A/T-rich response elements. One complex contains a 10-bp DNA half-site
response element (5'AAACATGTTT3') and the other contains a 22-bp DNA full
response element with a 2-bp spacer between two half-sites
(5'AAACATGTTTTAAAACATGTTT3'). In both structures, each half-site binds a p63DBD
dimer. The two p63DBD dimers do not interact in the presence of the DNA spacer,
whereas they interact with one another in the p63DBD/10-bp complex where the DNA 
simulates a full response element by packing end-to-end. A unique dimer-dimer
interaction involves a variable loop region, which differs in length and sequence
from the counterpart loop of p53DBD. The DNA trajectories in both structures
assume superhelical conformations. Surface plasmon resonance studies of
p63DBD/DNA binding yielded K(d) = 11.7 µM for a continuous full response element,
whereas binding was undetectable with the 22-bp DNA, suggesting an important
contribution of a p63DBD interdimer interface to binding and establishing that
p63DBD affinity to the response element is approximately 1,000-fold lower than
that of p53DBD. Analyses of the structural consequences of p63DBD mutations that 
cause developmental defects show that, although some mutations affect DNA binding
directly, the majority affects protein stability.

MA 02111, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic ulcerative stomatitis is a condition characterized by
chronic, painful oral ulcers, whose pathogenesis is unknown. Patients demonstrate
specific IgG autoantibodies against <U+0394>Np63a, an epithelial nuclear transcription
factor. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of patient
autoantibodies in the disease pathogenesis.
METHODS: Three-dimensional in vitro tissues consisting of a fully differentiated,
multilayer epithelium that mimics its in vivo counterpart were incubated with
serum from patients with chronic ulcerative stomatitis.
RESULTS: Our results show a subepithelial detachment of the epithelium at the
basement membrane interface, mimicking the oral ulcerations that are seen
clinically. Expression of basement membrane proteins Type IV collagen and
laminin-5 was unaltered, whereas the expression of a6ß4 integrins, hemidesmosome 
components that attach basal keratinocytes to the basement membrane, was reduced,
as determined by immunohistochemistry.
CONCLUSION: These results give evidence that patient autoantibodies are
pathogenic; and support an autoimmune pathogenesis in chronic ulcerative
stomatitis.

PURPOSE: To explore the roles of STAT3 in the regulation of <U+0394>Np63-dependent
proliferation and differentiation of rabbit limbal keratinocytes.
METHODS: siRNAs were designed to specifically suppress the expression of STAT3
and <U+0394>Np63, and their effects on limbal epithelial cell proliferation and
differentiation were examined. Ectopically expressed <U+0394>Np63 was used to compensate
for the decreased endogenous <U+0394>Np63. Immunoblot was used to examine the
expressions of STAT3, <U+0394>Np63, K3, integrin ß1, and involucrin.
RESULTS: Limbal tissue expresses higher level of phosphorylated and nuclear
translocated STAT3 compared with that of the cornea. Knockdown of STAT3
expression reduces the expression of <U+0394>Np63, inhibits the expansion of limbal
epithelial outgrowth, suppresses the expression of integrin ß1, and promotes the 
expression of involucrin.
CONCLUSIONS: STAT3 enhances the proliferation of limbal keratinocytes through a
<U+0394>Np63-dependent mechanism. Suppression of this pathway inhibits cell
proliferation with a concomitant increase of cell differentiation.

Many p53 missense mutations possess dominant-negative activity and oncogenic gain
of function. We report that for structurally destabilized p53 mutants, these
effects result from mutant-induced coaggregation of wild-type p53 and its
paralogs p63 and p73, thereby also inducing a heat-shock response. Aggregation of
mutant p53 resulted from self-assembly of a conserved aggregation-nucleating
sequence within the hydrophobic core of the DNA-binding domain, which becomes
exposed after mutation. Suppressing the aggregation propensity of this sequence
by mutagenesis abrogated gain of function and restored activity of wild-type p53 
and its paralogs. In the p53 germline mutation database, tumors carrying
aggregation-prone p53 mutations have a significantly lower frequency of wild-type
allele loss as compared to tumors harboring nonaggregating mutations, suggesting 
a difference in clonal selection of aggregating mutants. Overall, our study
reveals a novel disease mechanism for mutant p53 gain of function and suggests
that, at least in some respects, cancer could be considered an
aggregation-associated disease.

The transcription factor p63 has important functions in tumorigenesis, epidermal 
differentiation and stem cell self-renewal. The TP63 gene encodes multiple
protein isoforms that have different or even antagonistic roles in these
processes. The balance of p63 isoforms, together with the presence or absence of 
the other p53 family members, p73 and p53, has a striking biological impact.
There is increasing evidence that interactions between p53-family members,
whether cooperative or antagonistic, are involved in various cell processes. This
review summarizes the current understanding of the role of p63 in tumorigenesis, 
metastasis, cell migration and senescence. In particular, recent data indicate
important roles in adult stem cell and cancer stem cell regulation and in the
response of cancer cells to therapy.

The p63 gene is a transcription factor and a member of the p53 family.
Heterozygote mutation of the p63 gene is suggested in a number of human syndromes
including limb development and/or ectodermal dysplasia. The EEC syndrome,
consisting of ectrodactyly (E), ectodermal dysplasia (E) and cleft lip (C) with
or without cleft palate, is the prototype of these syndromes with the presence of
heterozygote mutation in the p63 gene in most of the patients. Nonsyndromic split
hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is one of the EEC-like syndromes, and the p63 gene 
mutation was reported in only a few patients. Five different loci have been
mapped to date, but the etiology is yet to be explained in the rest of the
patients. Here, we report two cases. Case 1, diagnosed with EEC syndrome, had
type 2 urogenital sinus and a new heterozygous mutation of 934G>A (D312N) in exon
8 of the p63 gene. Case 2 was diagnosed as SHFM with no mutation in the p63 gene.
Genotype and phenotype correlation of these two cases among the reported patients
is discussed in this report.

The p53 family of proteins consists of p53, p63 and p73, which are transcription 
factors that affect both cancer and development. It is now emerging that these
proteins also regulate maternal reproduction. Whereas p63 is important for
maturation of the egg, p73 ensures normal mitosis in the developing blastocyst.
p53 subsequently regulates implantation of the embryo through transcriptional
control of leukaemia inhibitory factor. Elucidating the cell biological basis of 
how these factors regulate female fertility may lead to new approaches to the
control of human maternal reproduction.

Previous studies have suggested an important role for the Janus kinase-signal
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathway in tumour
development. Therefore, we explored genetic variants in JAK-STAT pathway
associated genes with lymphoma risk. In samples of the EpiLymph case-control
study we genotyped 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using GoldenGate
BeadArray Technology (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Here, we report the
associations between selected SNPs and haplotypes of the JAK-STAT pathway and
risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and most
frequent B-NHL subtypes. Among 210 relevant JAK-STAT pathway-related SNPs,
polymorphisms in nine genes (BMF, IFNG, IL12A, SOCS1, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A,
STAT6, TP63) were significantly associated with lymphoma risk. At a study-wise
significance level, we obtained a risk reduction of 28% among carriers of the
heterozygous genotype of the STAT3 variant (rs1053023) for B-NHL. For six other
variants within the STAT3 gene we observed an inverse association with different 
lymphoma subtypes. A reduced risk for HL was observed for the heterozygous
genotype of the STAT6 SNP (rs324011). This is an explorative investigation to
examine associations between JAK-STAT signalling related genes and lymphoma risk.
The results implicate a relevant role of certain pathway-related genes in
lymphomagenesis, but still need to be approved by independent studies.

The secret second life of an innocent chaperone: the story of CD74 and B

This review deals with the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 
and its receptor, CD74. MIF and CD74 have been shown to regulate peripheral B
cell survival and were associated with tumor progression and metastasis. CD74
expression has been suggested to serve as a prognostic factor in many cancers,
with higher relative expression of CD74 behaving as a marker of tumor
progression. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, binding of MIF to CD74 
induces nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) activation and up-regulation of TAp63
expression, resulting in the secretion of interleukin 8 (IL-8), which in turn
promotes cell survival. In addition, TAp63 expression elevates expression of the 
integrin VLA-4, particularly during the advanced stage of the disease. Blocking
of CD74, TAp63, or VLA-4 inhibits the in vivo homing of CLL cells to the BM.
Thus, CD74 and its target genes, TAp63 and VLA-4, facilitate migration of CLL
cells back to the BM, where they interact with the supportive BM environment that
helps rescue them from apoptosis. These results are expected to pave the way
toward novel therapeutic strategies aimed at interrupting this survival pathway. 
One such agent, the monocolonal antibody milatuzumab directed at CD74, is already
being studied in early clinical trials.

Psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by the presence of red plaques on the
skin. This pathology is well-known to be a retinoid-sensitive disease. Previous
investigations have shown that retinoids can modulate epidermal proliferation
with an antiproliferative potential in hyperproliferative skins. The aim of this 
study was to compare the development of psoriatic substitutes cultured in a
retinoic acid supplemented medium with those cultured in medium receiving no
supplement, to define the effects of this growth factor on keratinocyte
proliferation and differentiation. The self-assembly method was used to create
substitutes. Characterization of the psoriatic substitutes was performed by
histological and immunolabeling analyses. Results showed that psoriatic
keratinocyte substitutes cultured with retinoic acid have a thinner epidermis
compared with psoriatic keratinocyte substitutes cultured without this
supplement. Further, the expression of all tested cell differentiation markers
was restored in psoriatic keratinocyte substitutes cultured in presence of
retinoic acid. No significant change in epidermal thickness or in the expression 
of late differentiation markers was observed in healthy keratinocyte substitutes 
cultured with or without retinoic acid; however, some changes were reported for
proliferation and early differentiation markers. Results suggest that retinoic
acid can modulate epidermal differentiation and proliferation with an
antiproliferative potential in psoriatic substitutes such as observed in
psoriatic skin in vivo.

Tumor suppressor p53 is crucial for embryonic implantation through
transcriptional up-regulation of uterine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This
article reports that p53 and estrogen receptor a were activated in endometrial
tissues during implantation to coordinately regulate LIF production. By using
human p53 knockin (Hupki) mice carrying a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at
codon 72 (arginine/proline), the arginine allele was demonstrated to produce
higher uterine LIF levels during implantation than the proline allele. In humans,
the diversity of haplotypes of the p53 gene has decreased during evolution,
because the arginine allele, existing in only a subset of haplotypes, is under
positive selection. This observation is consistent with previous results showing 
that the proline allele is enriched in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization
(IVF). Studies with p63- and p73-knockout mice have demonstrated the involvement 
of p63 and p73 in female reproduction and their roles in egg formation and
apoptosis (p63) and spindle checkpoint (p73) in female mice. Here, the role of
p63 and p73 in human reproduction was investigated. Selected alleles of SNPs in
p63 and p73 genes were enriched in IVF patients. These findings demonstrate that 
the p53 family members are involved in several steps to regulate female
reproduction in mice and humans.

In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than
300 validated associations between genetic variants and risk of approximately 70 
common diseases. A small number of rare variants with a frequency of usually less
than 1% are associated with a strongly enhanced risk, such as genetic variants of
TP53, RB1, BRCA1, and BRCA2. Only a very small number of SNPs (with a frequency
of more that 1% of the rare allele) have effects of a factor of two or higher.
Examples include APOE4 in Alzheimer's disease, LOXL1 in exfoliative glaucoma, and
CFH in age-related macular degeneration. However, the majority of all identified 
SNPs have odds ratios between 1.1 and 1.5. In the case of urinary bladder cancer,
all known SNPs that have been validated in sufficiently large populations are
associated with odds ratios smaller than 1.5. These SNPs are located next to the 
following genes: MYC, TP63, PSCA, the TERT-CLPTM1L locus, FGFR3, TACC3, NAT2,
CBX6, APOBEC3A, CCNE1, and UGT1A. It is likely that these moderate risk or "wimp 
SNPs" interact, and because of their high number, collectively have a strong
influence on whether an individual will develop cancer or not. It should be
considered that variants identified so far explain only approximately 5-10% of
the overall inherited risk. Possibly, the remaining variance is due to an even
higher number of SNPs with odds ratios smaller than 1.1. Recent studies have
provided the following information: (1) The functions of genes identified as
relevant for bladder cancer focus on detoxification of carcinogens, control of
the cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as maintenance of DNA integrity. (2) Many
novel SNPs are far away from the protein coding regions, suggesting that these
SNPs are located on distant-acting transcriptional enhancers. (3) The low odds
ratio of each individual bladder cancer-associated SNP is too low to justify
reasonable preventive measures. However, if the recently identified SNPs
interact, they may collectively result in a substantial risk that is of
preventive relevance. In addition to the "novel SNPs" identified by the recent
GWAS, at least 163 further variants have been reported in relation to bladder
cancer, although they have not been consistently validated in independent
case-control series. Moreover, given that only 60 of these 163 "old SNPs" are
covered by the SNP chips used in the recent GWAS, there are in principle 103
published variants still awaiting validation or disproval. In future, besides
identifying novel disease-associated rare variants by deep sequencing, it will
also be important to understand how the already identified variants interact.

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease in which dysregulation of p63, a member
of the p53 family that is crucial for skin development and maintenance, has been 
demonstrated. Involvement of miR-203, miR-21 and miR-125b, small non-coding RNAs 
implicated in the regulation of p63 or p53, has been suggested in the
patho-genesis of psoriasis. To elucidate the roles of p63 and p63-related
microRNAs in psoriasis and to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of
narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy, we studied the effects of NB-UVB
treatment on the expression of these molecules. Skin biopsies from 12 psoriasis
patients were collected before, during and after NB-UVB therapy. Real-time PCR
and immunohistochemistry showed that p63 expression was not significantly
affected, whereas NB-UVB phototherapy significantly decreased expression of
miR-21 (p = 0.003) and increased miR-125b levels (p = 0.003). The results
indicate that the unresolved p63 abnormality in treated epidermis may play a role
in maintenance of this disease.

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a member of the pathogen recognition receptors, is
widely expressed in various cells and has been shown to activate immune signaling
pathways by recognizing viral double-stranded RNA. Recently, it was reported that
the activation of TLR3 induced apoptosis in some cells, but the detailed
molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we found that in
endothelial cells polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C)) induced dose- and
time-dependent cell apoptosis, which was elicited by TLR3 activation, as TLR3
neutralization and down-regulation repressed the apoptosis. Poly(I-C) induced the
activation of both caspases 8 and 9, indicating that TLR3 triggered the signaling
of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Poly(I-C) up-regulated
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and its receptors, death 
receptors 4/5, resulting in initiating the extrinsic pathway. Furthermore,
poly(I-C) down-regulated anti-apoptotic protein, B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and
up-regulated Noxa, a key Bcl-2 homology 3-only antagonist of Bcl-2, leading to
the priming of the intrinsic pathway. A p53-related protein, the transactivating 
p63 isoform a (TAp63a), was induced by TLR3 activation and contributed to the
activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Both the cells
deficient in p63 gene expression by RNA interference and cells that overexpressed
the N-terminally truncated p63 isoform a (<U+0394>Np63a), a dominant-negative variant of
TAp63a, by gene transfection, survived TLR3 activation. Taken together, TAp63a is
a crucial regulator downstream of TLR3 to induce cell death via death receptors
and mitochondria.

Yes-associated protein (YAP) regulates DNA damage and chemosensitivity, as well
as functioning as a pro-growth, cell size regulator. For both of its roles,
regulation by phosphorylation is crucial. We undertook an in vitro screen to
identify novel YAP kinases to discover new signaling pathways to better
understand YAP's function. We identified JNK1 and JNK2 as robust YAP kinases, as 
well as mapped multiple sites of phosphorylation. Using inhibitors and siRNA, we 
showed that JNK specifically phosphorylates endogenous YAP in a number of cell
types. We show that YAP protects keratinocytes from UV irradiation but promotes
UV-induced apoptosis in a squamous cell carcinoma. We defined the mechanism for
this dual role to be YAP's ability to bind and stabilize the pro-proliferative
<U+0394>Np63a isoform in a JNK-dependent manner. Our report indicates that an evaluation
of the expression of the different isoforms of p63 and p73 is crucial in
determining YAP's function.

Little is known about the origin of basal-like breast cancers, an aggressive
disease that is highly similar to BRCA1-mutant breast cancers. p63 family
proteins that are structurally related to the p53 suppressor protein are known to
function in stem cell regulation and stratified epithelia development in multiple
tissues, and p63 expression may be a marker of basal-like breast cancers. Here we
report that <U+0394>Np63 isoforms of p63 are transcriptional targets for positive
regulation by BRCA1. Our analyses of breast cancer tissue microarrays and
BRCA1-modulated breast cancer cell lines do not support earlier reports that p63 
is a marker of basal-like or BRCA1 mutant cancers. Nevertheless, we found that
BRCA1 interacts with the specific p63 isoform <U+0394>Np63<U+03B3> along with transcription
factor isoforms AP-2a and AP-2<U+03B3>. BRCA1 required <U+0394>Np63<U+03B3> and AP-2<U+03B3> to localize to
an intronic enhancer region within the p63 gene to upregulate transcription of
the <U+0394>Np63 isoforms. In mammary stem/progenitor cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
<U+0394>Np63 expression resulted in genomic instability, increased cell proliferation,
loss of DNA damage checkpoint control, and impaired growth control. Together, our
findings establish that transcriptional upregulation of <U+0394>Np63 proteins is
critical for BRCA1 suppressor function and that defects in BRCA1-<U+0394>Np63 signaling 
are key events in the pathogenesis of basal-like breast cancer.

The TP63 gene, a member of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene family, can be
expressed as at least six isoforms due to alternative promoter use and
alternative splicing. The lack of p63 isoform-specific antibodies has limited the
analysis of the biological significance of p63. We report a novel set of
well-defined antibodies to examine p63 isoforms in mouse and human urothelium
during embryogenesis and tumor progression, respectively. We provide evidence
that basal and intermediate urothelial cells express p63 isoforms, with the TAp63
variant the first to be detected during development, whereas umbrella cells are
characterized by a p63-negative phenotype. Notably, we report that p63-null mice 
develop a bladder with an abnormal urothelium, constituted by a single layer of
cells that express uroplakin II and low molecular weight cytokeratins, consistent
with an umbrella cell phenotype. Finally, analysis of 202 human bladder
carcinomas revealed a new categorization of invasive tumors into basal-like
(positive for <U+0394>Np63 and high molecular weight cytokeratins and negative for low
molecular weight cytokeratins) versus luminal-like (negative for <U+0394>Np63 and high
molecular weight cytokeratins and positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins)
phenotypes, with <U+0394>Np63 expression associated with an aggressive clinical course
and poor prognosis. This study highlights the relevance of p63 isoforms in both
urothelial development and bladder carcinoma progression, with <U+0394>Np63 acting as an
oncogene in certain invasive bladder tumors.

Invasive micropapillary carcinoma is associated with frequent lymph node
metastasis and adverse clinical outcome. Initially described as a variant of
breast and ovarian carcinoma, it has subsequently been found in other organs,
most recently the colon. Reports of colorectal micropapillary carcinoma to date
are limited in number, and their molecular profile has not been established. The 
aims of the present study were to analyze their clinicopathological features and 
molecular profile, and compare them with those of conventional adenocarcinoma.
Clinicopathological features of a cohort of 379 patients with primary colorectal 
cancer were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of the pattern
characteristic of micropapillary carcinoma. We also assessed the expression of
KRT7, KRT20, CEACAM5, MUC1 (EMA, clone E29), MUC1 (clone MA695), MLH1, MSH2, MSH6
and TP53 by immunohistochemistry. Genetic assessments of microsatellite
instability, chromosomes 17p and 18q, and mutations in TP53, BRAF and KRAS were
performed using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. In
all, 60 of the reviewed cases (16%) had a micropapillary component that ranged
from 5 to 95% of the tumor, characterized by a higher frequency of an
infiltrative pattern, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, a higher depth of
invasion and more positive lymph nodes than conventional adenocarcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry for MUC1 (clone MA695) and MUC1 (EMA, clone E29) enhanced
the characteristic inside-out staining pattern of the micropapillary carcinoma
component, whereas the rest of the tumor showed luminal staining patterns. KRT7
expression was slightly increased in micropapillary carcinoma, but did not reach 
significance (17-3%, P=0.1967). The molecular parameters showed a higher
frequency of TP53 alterations and a low incidence of microsatellite instability
and RER phenotype (loss of mismatch repair protein) in micropapillary carcinoma. 
With regard to the histological parameters, micropapillary carcinoma appears to
be more aggressive than conventional colorectal adenocarcinoma. The molecular
profile supports the hypothesis that micropapillary carcinoma carcinogenesis
develops through the classical chromosomal instability pathway.

PPAR<U+03B3> ligands induce growth inhibition and apoptosis through p63 and p73 in human
ovarian cancer cells.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) agonists, including
thiazolidinediones (TZDs), can induce anti-proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis in various cancer cell types. This study investigated the mechanism of 
the anticancer effect of TZDs on human ovarian cancer. Six human ovarian cancer
cell lines (NIH:OVCAR3, SKOV3, SNU-251, SNU-8, SNU-840, and 2774) were treated
with the TZD, which induced dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth.
Additionally, these cell lines exhibited various expression levels of PPAR<U+03B3>
protein as revealed by Western blotting. Flow cytometry showed that the cell
cycle was arrested at the G1 phase, as demonstrated by the appearance of a sub-G1
peak. This observation was corroborated by the finding of increased levels of
Bax, p21, PARP, and cleaved caspase 3 in TGZ-treated cells. Interestingly, when
we determined the effect of p53-induced growth inhibition in these three human
ovarian cancer cells, we found that they either lacked p53 or contained a mutant 
form of p53. Furthermore, TGZ induced the expression of endogenous or exogenous
p63 and p73 proteins and p63- or p73-directed short hairpin (si) RNAs inhibited
the ability of TGZ to regulate expression of p21 in these cells. Thus, our
results suggest that PPAR<U+03B3> ligands can induce growth suppression of ovarian
cancer cells and mediate p63 and p73 expression, leading to enhanced growth
inhibition and apoptosis. The tumor suppressive effects of PPAR<U+03B3> ligands may have
applications for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Ionizing radiation-induced TAp63a phosphorylation at C-terminal S/TQ motifs
requires the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain.

University, Seoul, South Korea.

TAp63a, a homolog of p53 and one of six alternatively spliced p63 isoforms, is a 
critical mediator of the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage response in
female germ cells and also tumor suppression in somatic cells. The <U+0394>Np63a
isoform, lacking the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain, is associated with
oncogenic potential. The mechanism of p63 functional regulation is not well
understood. TAp63a is phosphorylated by ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA
damage and gene transactivation is likely to be involved. Based on information
gleaned from studies on p53, we explored the possibility that TAp63a S/TQ sites
may be phosphorylated by IR-induced DNA damage. Our findings show a
wortmanin-sensitive kinase phosphorylates TAp63a at C-terminal Ser-Gln and
Thr-Gln (S/TQ) sites but not N-terminal S/TQ sites. <U+0394>Np63a, lacking the TA
domain, and TAp63<U+03B3>, lacking C-terminal domains, including S/TQ sites, fail to
undergo IR-induced phosphorylation. We propose a model for TA domain-dependent
C-terminal phosphorylation drawing from previously described self-inactivating
intramolecular interaction between N-terminal TA domain and C-terminal
Transactivation Inhibitory Domain (TID) of TAp63a. A specific topology adopted
only by TAp63a, but not possible for <U+0394>Np63a or TAp63<U+03B3>, may lead to
TAp63a-specific kinase recruitment, phosphorylation and self-inactivation
release. TID-lacking TAp63<U+03B3>, like p53, is constitutively active and thus may
forgo phosphorylation-dependent activation. Thus, p53 is regulated by protein
stabilization and TAp63a by protein activation but both appear to involve S/TQ
phosphorylation. The difference in phosphorylation potential of TAp63a and <U+0394>Np63a
may in part help explain why the two similar isoforms have diametrically opposite
tumor suppression and oncogene functions, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential diagnostic role of the myoepithelial marker 
p63 in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of breast in comparison to other
diagnostic tools.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 49 FNAC of breast were assessed according to clinical,
mammographic, cytological findings, and p63 immunostaining on FNAC. The strength 
of agreement with final histological diagnosis (FHD) was measured by kappa test.
RESULTS: p63 was positive in myoepithelial cells of 75% (9/12) of benign cases
and negative in 89% (33/37) of the malignant cases with strong agreement with the
FHD (p < 0.0001, <U+03BA> = 0.63). All the malignant positive cases showed variable
degrees of in situ component. Only one malignant case (1/37, 0.03%) showed few
p63 positive neoplastic cells in FNAC. Combined FNAC and p63 staining (with <25% 
cutoff point) to diagnose malignancy showed 100% sensitivity, 75% specificity,
92% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, and 94% diagnostic
accuracy. Most of the cytologically suspicious cases (7/9, 78%) showed negative
p63 staining results, and all these suspicious cases (100%) proved to be
malignant by the FHD. There was poor agreement between diagnosis according to
positive background naked nuclei (NN) and the FHD (<U+03BA> = 0.24 and p < 0.0001);
however, presence of more than 74% positive NN is strongly suggestive of
fibroadenoma.
CONCLUSION: p63 immunostaining with a cutoff value of <25% to diagnose malignancy
is a highly sensitive and specific myoepithelial marker which is recommended as
an adjuvant tool to FNAC of breast in suspicious cases.

Nuclear findings, including size, shape, chromatin, or nucleoli, affect the
cytological diagnosis and were found to have prognostic significance in several
studies based on morphometric analysis. In this study, we investigated whether
the nucleus area relates to the appearance of p63-positive myoepithelial cells.
The nucleus area was analyzed in 101 breast cancers and 14 benign breast lesions 
using morphometric analysis and immunohistochemistry for p63. Breast cancer
patients were classified into two groups; small nucleus group (n = 19) and large 
nucleus group (n = 82) based on the average nucleus area of ductal cells. The
nucleus area was significantly negative correlating with p63-positive
myoepithelial cells (P = 0.031), and there was a significant positive correlation
with small cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (P = 0.002). Although small cells
with hyperchromatic nuclei were similar to myoepithelial cells, there was no
significant correlation with the appearance of small cells with hyperchromatic
nuclei and p63-positive myoepithelial cells in breast cancer patients (P =
0.189). Although the identification of normal myoepithelial cells is mainly
performed by immunostaining for p63, morphometric analysis of the nucleus area
also suggests the existence of p63-positive myoepithelial cells.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been reported to be
clinically significant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, because
most previous studies focused only on adenocarcinomas, EGFR mutations in other
histotypes are poorly investigated. We evaluated the frequency of EGFR gene
mutations in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its clinicopathological features. 
In total, 89 frozen tumor specimens that had been first diagnosed as SCCs, were
examined for EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21 using direct sequencing,
PNA-enriched sequencing and SmartAmp2. Additionally, pathological investigation, 
including immunostaining for p63 and TTF-1, alcian blue staining and EGFR
mutation-specific immunohistochemistry in mutation-positive samples was also
performed. The frequency of EGFR mutations was 5.6% (5/89); all mutations were
deletions in EGFR exon 19. Immunohistological investigation of these samples
revealed that two of five were positive for p63 and TTF-1 staining, and showed
production of mucin, as evidenced by alcian blue staining. Consequently, three of
the samples were considered to be true SCC at final pathological diagnosis, while
the remaining two samples were revised to adenosquamous carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma. The final frequency of the EGFR mutations in true SCC was 3.4%
(3/87). In conclusion, EGFR mutations were found in a small, but significant,
number of SCC tumor samples and thus EGFR mutational analysis was useful in the
accurate diagnosis of SCC. Our data demonstrate that EGFR mutational analysis
should be performed not only in adenocarcinoma, but also in SCC to allow accurate
diagnosis and treatment.

Phosphohistone H3 assessed proliferation has strong prognostic value. Lymph
vessel invasion by D2-40 is also prognostic, but D2-40+ myoepithelial expression 
in small ducts completely filled by solid-pattern ductal carcinoma in situ can
mimic lymphovascular invasion. As myoepithelial cells are also p63 positive, we
have investigated whether lymph vessel invasion identified by combined D2-40/p63 
is stronger prognostically than by D2-40 alone, and whether it has independent
prognostic value to phosphohistone H3. In 240 operable T(1-2)N(0)M(0) node
negative invasive breast cancer patients <71 years, phosphohistone H3 was
determined by quantitative immunohistochemistry and lymph vessel invasion by
D2-40/p63 double immunostaining. Correlation analysis between the
clinico-pathologic factors and lymph vessel invasion, and univariate and
multivariate prognostic survival analysis were performed. With median 117 (range:
12-192) months follow-up, 36 patients (15%) developed and 28 (12%) died of
distant metastases. Ten of the 61 patients (16%) with cancer cells surrounded by 
D2-40 were p63 positive and none of these 'false lymph vessel invasion' recurred.
D2-40+/p63- lymph vessel invasion occurred in 51/239 (21%) cases and correlated
with grade, mitotic activity index, phosphohistone H3, ER, cytokeratin14, and
HER2. D2-40+/p63- lymph vessel invasion was strongly prognostic, but far more in 
women =55 than those <55 years (P<0.0001 and 0.04). With multivariate analysis,
phosphohistone H3 proliferation was the strongest single prognosticator. Lymph
vessel invasion had additional prognostic value to phosphohistone H3 only in
women =55. This group of patients, without/with lymph vessel invasion, had
10-year survival rates of 83 and 50%, respectively (hazard ratio-lymph vessel
invasion=3.0, P=0.04; hazard ratio-phosphohistone H3=6.9, P=0.002). Where age was
<55 years, only phosphohistone H3 had independent prognostic value. Combinations 
of other features had no additional value. In conclusion, T(1-2)N(0)M(0) invasive
breast cancer patients =55 years with phosphohistone H3=13, D2-40+/p63- defined
lymph vessel invasion identifies a subgroup with a high risk of distant
metastases.

The p63 gene, a member of the p53 family, is expressed as TA and <U+0394>N isoforms.
<U+0394>Np63 is the predominant isoform expressed in cells of epithelial origin and
frequently overexpressed in cancers. However, what regulates p63 expression is
uncertain. Here, we showed that <U+0394>Np63 is regulated by the transcription factor
DEC1, a p53 family target. We also showed that the ability of DEC1 to regulate
<U+0394>Np63 is enhanced by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or knockdown of
histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Consistent with this, we found that DEC1 and HDAC2
physically interact and knockdown of HDAC2 leads to increased binding of DEC1 to 
the <U+0394>Np63 promoter. Interestingly, we found that growth suppression induced by
HDAC inhibitors is attenuated by ectopic expression of DEC1 in a <U+0394>Np63-dependent 
manner. In addition, we showed that ectopic expression of DEC1 inhibits, whereas 
knockdown of DEC1 promotes, keratinocyte differentiation via modulating <U+0394>Np63
expression. Finally, we showed that DEC1 cooperates with HDAC inhibitors to
further decrease keratinocyte differentiation. Together, we conclude that <U+0394>Np63
is a novel target of DEC1 and HDAC2 and modulates the efficacy of HDAC inhibitors
in growth suppression and keratinocyte differentiation.

Endogenous retrovirus drives hitherto unknown proapoptotic p63 isoforms in the

TAp63, but not its homolog p53, eliminates oocytes that suffered DNA damage. An
equivalent gene for guarding the male germ line is currently not known. Here we
identify hitherto unknown human p63 transcripts with unique 5'-ends derived from 
incorporated exons upstream of the currently mapped TP63 gene. These unique p63
transcripts are highly and specifically expressed in testis. Their most upstream 
region corresponds to a LTR of the human endogenous retrovirus 9 (ERV9). The
insertion of this LTR upstream of the TP63 locus occurred only recently in
evolution and is unique to humans and great apes (Hominidae). A corresponding p63
protein is the sole p63 species in healthy human testis, and is strongly
expressed in spermatogenic precursors but not in mature spermatozoa. In response 
to DNA damage, this human male germ-cell-encoded TAp63 protein (designated
GTAp63) is activated by caspase cleavage near its carboxyterminal domain and
induces apoptosis. Human testicular cancer tissues and cell lines largely lost
p63 expression. However, pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylases
completely restores p63 expression in testicular cancer cells (>3,000-fold
increase). Our data support a model whereby testis-specific GTAp63 protects the
genomic integrity of the male germ line and acts as a tumor suppressor. In
Hominidae, this guardian function was greatly enhanced by integration of an
endogenous retrovirus upstream of the TP63 locus that occurred 15 million years
ago. By providing increased germ-line stability, this event may have contributed 
to the evolution of hominids and enabled their long reproductive periods.

BACKGROUND: This study was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-203
(miR-203) and <U+0394>Np63 on cell proliferation and the functional connection between
miR-203 and <U+0394>Np63 in ESCC.
METHODS: We employed 2 human ESCC cell lines, Eca109 and TE-1, as the model
system. The effect of miR-203 and <U+0394>Np63 on cell proliferation was determined in
cells transfected with miR-203 mimic and <U+0394>Np63 small interfering RNA (siRNA),
respectively. The regulation of <U+0394>Np63 expression in ESCC cells by miR-203 was
studied by luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and western blot analysis in cells
transfected with miR-203. The effect of <U+0394>Np63 re-expression on miR-203 induced
inhibition of cell proliferation was studied by cell proliferation assay in cells
cotransfected with miR-203 and pcDNA-<U+0394>Np63 plasmid (without the 3'-UTR of <U+0394>Np63).
RESULTS: We found that both miR-203 and <U+0394>Np63 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell
proliferation in ESCC. MiR-203 could down-regulate endogenous <U+0394>Np63 expression at
the posttranscriptional level. Moreover, re-expression of <U+0394>Np63 in cells
transfected with miR-203 significantly attenuated the miR-203 induced inhibition 
of cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data implied that miR-203 could inhibit cell proliferation in
human ESCC through <U+0394>Np63-mediated signal pathway. Therefore, we propose that
miR-203 might be used as a therapeutic agent for human ESCC.

The ancient p53 paralogs p63 and p73 regulate specific tissue formation, cell
survival and cell death via their TA and <U+0394>N isoforms. Targeted disruption of the 
p73 locus leads to severe defects in the development of the central nervous
system (CNS), and p73 has recently been shown to be an essential regulator of
neural stem cell maintenance and differentiation in both embryonal and adult
neurogenesis. In contrast, global p63-/- mice lack skin and limbs. Moreover, p63 
is detectable in embryonic cortex. It has previously been proposed to also play
critical pro-death and pro-survival roles in neural precursors of the developing 
sympathetic and central nervous system, respectively, based on experimental
overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of p63. Here we perform an extensive 
analysis of the developing central nervous system in global p63-/- mice and their
wildtype littermates. Brain and spinal cord of embryos and newborn mice were
assessed in vivo for neuroanatomy, histology, apoptosis, proliferation, stemness 
and differentiation, and in vitro for self-renewal and maturation in neurosphere 
assays. None of these analyses revealed a detectable phenotype in p63-/- mice.
Hence, despite the profound impact of p63 on the development of stratified
epithelia and limbs, p63 is completely dispensable for proper development of the 
central nervous system. Thus, despite their strong homology, the non-overlapping 
tissue specificity of p63 and p73 functions appears more pronounced than
previously anticipated.

The p53 tumor suppressor, a central mediator of chemosensitivity in normal cells,
is functionally inactivated in many human cancers. Therefore, a central challenge
in human cancer therapy is the identification of pathways that control tumor cell
survival and chemosensitivity in the absence of functional p53. The p53-related
transcription factors p63 and p73 exhibit distinct functionsp73 mediates
chemosensitivity while p63 promotes proliferation and cell survivaland are both 
overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, how p63 and p73
interact functionally and govern the balance between prosurvival and proapoptotic
programs in SCC remains elusive. Here, we identify a microRNA-dependent mechanism
of p63/p73 crosstalk that regulates p53-independent survival of both human and
murine SCC. We first discovered that a subset of p63-regulated microRNAs target
p73 for inhibition. One of these, miR-193a-5p, expression of which was repressed 
by p63, was activated by proapoptotic p73 isoforms in both normal cells and tumor
cells in vivo. Chemotherapy caused p63/p73-dependent induction of this microRNA, 
thereby limiting chemosensitivity due to microRNA-mediated feedback inhibition of
p73. Importantly, inhibiting miR-193a interrupted this feedback and thereby
suppressed tumor cell viability and induced dramatic chemosensitivity both in
vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have identified a direct, microRNA-dependent
regulatory circuit mediating inducible chemoresistance, whose inhibition may
provide a new therapeutic opportunity in p53-deficient tumors.

BACKGROUND: The TP73 and TP63 genes are members of the p53 tumor suppressor
family and are expressed in different N-terminal isoforms either with
proapoptotic (transactivation domain, TA) and antiapoptotic (N-terminally
truncated, <U+0394>N) function. Unlike p53, the role of p73 and p63 in tumor is
controversial. It has been recently hypothesized that altered <U+0394>N:TA expression
ratio, rather than single isoform overexpression, plays a role in the
pathogenesis of many diseases, including lung cancer.
METHODS: Isoform-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction and
immunohistochemistry analysis on matched cancer and corresponding normal tissues 
from surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have been performed
aiming to explore the expression levels of each p63 and p73 N-terminal isoforms
and their <U+0394>N:TA expression ratio.
RESULTS: For both p63 and p73, a N-terminal isoform-specific modulation that
alter <U+0394>N:TA isoform balance was identified. In particular, <U+0394>Np63 isoform was
significantly up-modulated, whereas TAp63 was slightly down-modulated in NSCLC
specimens. Likewise, <U+0394>2p73 and <U+0394>2/3p73 were up-modulated, whereas <U+0394>Np73 and
<U+0394>N'p73 isoforms were down-modulated. Moreover, a higher TAp63 and <U+0394>N'p73
transcripts expression, detected in the normal tissue surrounding the tumors,
correlates with poor patient outcome, representing independent prognostic factors
for overall survival (<U+0394>N'p73: p = 0.049, hazard ratio = 3.091, 95% confidence
interval = 1.005-9.524 and TAp63: p = 0.001, hazard ratio = 8.091, 95% confidence
interval = 2.254-29.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that p63 and p73 altered <U+0394>N:TA expression ratio 
occurs in NSCLC likely contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells exposed to cisplatin (CIS)
displayed a dramatic ATM-dependent phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a that leads to the
transcriptional regulation of downstream mRNAs. Here, we report that phospho
(p)-<U+0394>Np63a transcriptionally deregulates miRNA expression after CIS treatment.
Several p-<U+0394>Np63a-dependent microRNA species (miRNAs) were deregulated in HNSCC
cells upon CIS exposure, including miR-181a, miR-519a, and miR-374a
(downregulated) and miR-630 (upregulated). Deregulation of miRNA expression led
to subsequent modulation of mRNA expression of several targets (TP53-S46, HIPK2, 
ATM, CDKN1A and 1B, CASP3, PARP1 and 2, DDIT1 and 4, BCL2 and BCL2L2, TP73, YES1,
and YAP1) that are involved in the apoptotic process. Our data support the notion
that miRNAs are critical downstream targets of p-<U+0394>Np63a and mediate key pathways 
implicated in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Strategies to address resistance to platin drugs are greatly needed in human
epithelial cancers (e.g., ovarian, head/neck, and lung) where platins are used
widely and resistance occurs commonly. We found that upon <U+0394>Np63a overexpression, 
AKT1 and phospho-AKT1 levels are upregulated in cancer cells. Investigations
using gel-shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation and functional reporter assays
implicated <U+0394>Np63a in positive regulation of AKT1 transcription. Importantly, we
found that <U+0394>Np63a, AKT1, and phospho-AKT levels are greater in 2008CI3
CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer cells than in 2008 CDDP-sensitive cells.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of <U+0394>Np63a expression dramatically decreased AKT1
expression, whereas knockdown of either <U+0394>Np63a or AKT1 decreased cell
proliferation and increased death of ovarian and head/neck cancer cells.
Conversely, enforced expression of <U+0394>Np63a increased cancer cell proliferation and
reduced apoptosis. Together, our findings define a novel <U+0394>Np63a-dependent
regulatory mechanism for AKT1 expression and its role in chemotherapeutic
resistance of ovarian and head/neck cancer cells.

The mammary gland is a dynamic organ that only undergoes complete differentiation
during pregnancy. Differentiation is fuelled by asymmetric division of stem cells
that reside in normally quiescent niches in the resting gland in response to
pregnancy-associated hormones. Loss of regulation of stem cells is believed to
underlie some breast cancers. This process is poorly understood in humans since
it is difficult to extract stem cells from the lactating gland. We have
identified a p63-positive population in breastmilk that proliferates and
differentiates into at least two separate mammary lineages in culture. Nuclear
translocation of p63 coincides with expression of the cell-cycle arrest protein
14-3-3s (Sigma) and precedes differentiation. Transient down-regulation of Sigma 
promotes maintenance of the p63-positive population without affecting normal
differentiation. We propose that p63-postive cells from breastmilk represent a
novel source of cells to model regulation of mammary gland development and
tumorigenesis.

It is widely held that solid cell nests (SCN) of the thyroid are ultimobranchial 
body remnants. SCNs are composed of main cells and C cells. It has been suggested
that main cells might be pluripotent cells contributing to the histogenesis of C 
cells and follicular cells, as well as to the formation of certain thyroid
tumors. The present study sought to analyze the immunohistochemical profile of
SCN and to investigate the potential stem cell role of SCN main cells. Tissue
sections from ten cases of nodular hyperplasia (non-tumor goiter) with SCNs were 
retrieved from the files of the Hospital Infanta Luisa (Seville, Spain).
Parathormone (PTH), calcitonin (CT), thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid transcription
factor (TTF-1), galectin 3 (GAL3), cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), p63, bcl-2, OCT4, and 
SALL4 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Patient clinical data
were collected, and tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for
histological examination. Most cells stained negative for PTH, CT, TG, and TTF-1.
Some cells staining positive for TTF-1 and CT required discussion. However,
bcl-2, p63, GAL3, and CK 19 protein expression was detected in main cells. OCT4
protein expression was detected in only two cases, and SALL4 expression in none. 
Positive staining for bcl-2 and p63, and negative staining for PTH, CT, and TG in
SCN main cells are both consistent with the widely accepted minimalist definition
of stem cells, thus supporting the hypothesis that they may play a stem cell role
in the thyroid gland, although further research will be required into stem cell
markers. Furthermore, p63 and GAL-3 staining provides a much more sensitive means
of detecting SCNs than staining for carcinoembryonic antigen, calcitonin, or
other markers; this may help to distinguish SCNs from their mimics.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if alteration in TP63 is responsible for a Chinese
patient with ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia clefting (EEC) syndrome, but
without cleft palate/lip.
METHODS: Screening of TP63 gene was performed in the patient with EEC syndrome
and his family members using PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
analysis, then performed by direct sequencing of the coding region.
RESULTS: A C > T substitution at nucleotide position 838 in exon 7 was detected
in the patient, and the change predicted a heterozygous missense mutation,
Arg280Cys. His parents showed the wild type.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the de novo mutation Arg280Cys of the TP63
gene observed in the patient maybe contribute to his EEC syndrome.

PURPOSE: Wogonin, a plant flavonoid, has antitumor activity in various cancers.
Dysregulation of GSK-3ß has been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer
progression. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity and the
mechanistic action of wogonin in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells.
METHODS: The effects of wogonin on the cell survival and apoptosis in NPC cells
were investigated by MTS assay, flow cytometry, and PARP cleavage assays.
Pharmacological inhibitors (BIO, LiCl, and OA), or small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
were used to address the expression status of GSK-3ß and the anticancer effect of
<U+0394>Np63 in NPC cells.
RESULTS: Wogonin was shown to induce dose-dependent cell apoptosis due to the
induction of sub-G1-phase cells, PARP cleavage, and downregulation of <U+0394>Np63, a
survival factor in NPC cells. Strikingly, the apoptotic effect of wogonin
involved GSK-3ß inactivation via prominent inhibition of phosphorylation at
Tyr216 and slightly increment of phosphorylation at Ser9, while there is no
change in total GSK-3ß proteins. Dysregulation of GSK-3ß caused cell apoptosis
was confirmed by pharmacological inhibitors (lithium chloroid, LiCl, and
6-bro-moindirubin-3-oxime, BIO). Administration of okadaic acid (OA, a protein
phosphatase inhibitor) that significantly inactivated GSK-3ß also induced <U+0394>Np63
downregulation and apoptosis. Targeted silencing of <U+0394>Np63 repressed the
phosphorylation of GSK-3ß at Tyr216 and sensitized NPC cells to wogonin-induced
apoptosis. Furthermore, GSK-3ß or PP2A inhibitors enhanced wogonin-induced
apoptosis via activation of caspase 3/7.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that GSK-3ß, as well as <U+0394>Np63, are novel
targets for wogonin action and suggest that wogonin might provide a potential
therapeutic option in NPC. Further in vitro and in vivo studies will help to
clarify the therapeutic role of wogonin in NPC.

Phospho-<U+0394>Np63a/Rpn13-dependent regulation of LKB1 degradation modulates autophagy
in cancer cells.

Oxidative stress was shown to promote the translocation of Ataxia-telangiectasia 
mutated (ATM) to cytoplasm and trigger the LKB1-AMPK-tuberin pathway leading to a
down-regulation of mTOR and subsequently inducing the programmed cell death II
(autophagy). Cisplatin was previously found to induce the ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. In this study, 
phosphorylated (p)-<U+0394>Np63a was shown to bind the ATM promoter, to increase the ATM
promoter activity and to enhance the ATM cytoplasmic accumulation. P-<U+0394>Np63a
protein was further shown to interact with the Rpn13 protein leading to a
proteasome-dependent degradation of p-<U+0394>Np63a and thereby protecting LKB1 from the
degradation. In SCC cells (with an altered ability to support the ATM-dependent
<U+0394>Np63a phosphorylation), the non-phosphorylated <U+0394>Np63a protein failed to form
protein complexes with the Rpn13 protein and thereby allowing the latter to bind 
and target LKB1 into a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway thereby
modulating a cisplatin-induced autophagy. We thus suggest that SCC cells
sensitive to cisplatin-induced cell death are likely to display a greater ratio
of p-<U+0394>Np63a/non-phosphorylated <U+0394>Np63a than cells with the innate
resistant/impaired response to a cisplatin-induced cell death. Our data also
suggest that the choice made by Rpn13 between p-<U+0394>Np63a or LKB1 to be targeted for
degradation is critical for cell death decision made by cancer cells in response 
to chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: To determine whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition is involved in
the development of corneal subepithelial fibrosis (pannus).
METHODS: Frozen samples of pannus tissue removed from human corneas with a
diagnosis of total limbal stem cell deficiency were characterized by
immunostaining for both epithelial and mesenchymal markers. We selected
transformation-related protein 63 (p63) and pancytokeratin as epithelial markers 
and vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) as mesenchymal markers.
Immunostaining for ß-catenin and E-cadherin was performed to determine
wingless-Int (Wnt)-pathway activation. RT-PCR analysis was also performed on
epithelial tissue obtained from pannus samples after dispase digestion.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed strong nuclear expression of p63 and weak 
intercellular expression of E-cadherin in epithelial basal cells of pannus
tissue. Furthermore, translocation of ß-catenin from intercellular junctions to
the nucleus and cytoplasm was also observed. Double-positive cells for both p63
and a-SMA were observed in the subepithelial stroma of pannus tissue, which was
supported by RT-PCR and cytospin analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition may be partially involved in the
development of subepithelial corneal fibrosis due to total limbal stem cell
deficiency.

growth factor ß Signaling Pathway with Smad2 and I<U+03BA>B Kinase a in squamous cell

The expression of p63 (TP63/p51) occurs in the basal cells of stratified
epithelia and is strongly enhanced at the early stages of squamous cell
carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck, skin, cervix, and others. We analyzed a
promoter/enhancer region (2k<U+0394>N) that drives the predominant expression of <U+0394>Np63
for sensitivity to Smad signaling pathways. Reporter assays in HepG2 cells showed
a moderate activation of 2k<U+0394>N by Smad2 and I<U+03BA>B kinase a (IKKa), partners of the
newly identified keratinocyte-specific transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß)
signaling, but not by other Smad molecules. In A431 cells, 2k<U+0394>N was activated by 
Smad2 and IKKa, for which a Smad binding element (SMD2) at -204 was essential.
Binding of Smad2 to the chromosomal SMD2 site was detectable. The association of 
Smad2 with IKKa was evident in the nucleus of A431, accounting for the
enhancement of <U+0394>Np63 expression by TGF-ß. Moreover, both <U+0394>Np63 and IKKa were
necessary to maintain the noninvasive phenotype of this cell line. FaDu, an
invasive, Smad4-deficient SCC, also allowed 2k<U+0394>N transactivation by transfected
Smad2 in the presence of endogenous IKKa. Reflecting the lack of chromosomal
SMD2-Smad2 association and the absence of nuclear IKKa, however, endogenous <U+0394>Np63
was not controlled by TGF-ß or IKKa in FaDu. SCC tissue arrays showed nuclear
accumulation of IKKa and p63 intensification in well-differentiated noninvasive
lesions. This study indicates that p63 is a target gene of the proposed
keratinocyte-specific TGF-ß signal pathway for suppression of the malignant
conversion of SCC.

Studies have established that autophagy constitutes an efficient process to
recycle cellular components and certain proteins. The phenomenon was demonstrated
primarily in response to nutrient starvation, and there are increasing evidences 
that it is implied in differentiation. Keratinocyte differentiation was going
along an activation of lysosomal enzymes and organelle clearance, and terminal
steps are sometimes described as a specialized form of cell death leading to
corneocytes. We examined whether initiation of the process in human keratinocyte 
HaCaT involves autophagy. The KSFM culture medium was substituted by M199, which
contains a low glucose concentration but a high calcium level (known to induce
differentiation). Metabolic stress reduced enhanced cell number in G(1) phase,
without apoptotic features (<U+0394><U+03A8>mt and membrane integrity are unchanged).
Morphological changes were associated with a lower integrin ß1 expression and
modifications of protein levels involved in keratinocyte differentiation
(involucrin, keratin K10 and <U+0394>Np63a). Whereas autophagic signalling was supported
by SIRT1 and pAMPK (T172) increase according to time kinetic, which led to the
disappearance of mTOR phosphorylated on S2448 residue. The significant Bcl-X(L)
level reduction with stress promoted autophagy, by the release of Beclin-1,
whereas ATG5-ATG12 and LC3-II that are involved in autophagosome formation were
enhanced significantly. Then, the level of lysosomal protein cathepsin B rose to 
execute autophagy. Kinetic studies established that autophagy would constitute an
early signalling process required for keratinocyte commitment in differentiation 
pathway.

The availability of targeted therapies has created a need for precise subtyping
of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). The aim of this study was to assess
the utility of immunohistochemical markers in subtyping poorly differentiated
NSCLC and to compare the results of immunohistochemical staining on biopsies with
the corresponding resections. Thirty-nine cases of NSCLC that could not be
further classified on biopsy and had subsequent resection specimens were
identified. Classification of the tumor was based on the resection specimen using
the World Health Organization criteria. All biopsies and resections were stained 
with CK7, TTF-1, napsin A (novel aspartic proteinase of the pepsin family), p63, 
CK5/6, and 34ßE12. The specimens included 20 adenocarcinomas (ACs), 15 squamous
cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 4 large-cell carcinomas (LCCs). TTF-1 was positive in
biopsies from 16 of 20 ACs, 2 of 4 LCCs, and none of the SCCs. p63 was positive
in all 15 SCCs, 2 of 20 ACs (both were also positive for TTF-1 and napsin A), and
none of the LCCs. CK5/6 was positive in 11 of 15 SCCs (all p63 positive) but none
of the ACs or LCCs. Napsin A stained 11 of 19 ACs (all TTF-1 positive) but none
of the other tumors. Staining for CK7 was present in 19 of 19 ACs and 9 of 15
SCCs. 34ßE12 stained both SCCs (15 of 15) and ACs (12 of 20). The combination of 
TTF-1, napsin A, p63, and CK5/6 allowed an accurate classification of 30 of39
(77%) cases. Of 232 pairs of slides (biopsy and resection) stained with
immunohistochemical markers, 12 (5%) showed discrepancies in immunohistochemical 
staining between biopsies and their corresponding resections. Immunohistochemical
staining using a combination of TTF-1, napsin A, p63, and CK5/6 allows
subclassification of poorly differentiated NSCLCs on small lung biopsies in most 
cases. Discrepancies in immunohistochemical staining between biopsies and
resections are uncommon.

The transcription factor p63 is required for proper epidermal barrier formation
and maintenance. Herein, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA
sequencing to identify novel p63 target genes involved in normal human epidermal 
keratinocyte (NHEKs) growth and differentiation. We identified over 2000 genomic 
sites bound by p63, of which 82 were also transcriptionally regulated by p63 in
NHEKs. Through the discovery of interleukin-1-a as a p63 target gene, we
identified that p63 is a regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk. Further, 
three-dimensional organotypic co-cultures revealed TCF7L1, another novel p63
target gene, as a regulator of epidermal proliferation and differentiation,
providing a mechanism by which p63 maintains the proliferative potential of basal
epidermal cells. The discovery of new target genes links p63 to diverse signaling
pathways required for epidermal development, including regulation of paracrine
signaling to proliferative potential. Further mechanistic insight into p63
regulation of epidermal cell growth and differentiation is provided by the
identification of a number of novel p63 target genes in this study.

This is the first study to show that cigarette smoking induced the
LKB1/PEA3/<U+0394>Np63-dependent transcriptional regulation of inflammatory molecules,
such as COX-2/PTGS-2. Using mainstream smoke extract (MSE) and sidestream smoke
extract (SSE) as modeling tools for primary and second-hand smoking, we found
that both MSE and SSE down regulated protein levels for LKB1, while up regulated 
protein levels for PEA3 and COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Using the
endogenous ChIP analysis, we further found that the C/EBPß, NF-kB, NF-Y (CHOP),
PEA3 (ETS), and <U+0394>Np63 proteins bound to the specific area (-550 to -130) of the
COX-2 promoter, while forming multiple protein complexes in lung cancer cells
exposed to MSE and SSE. Our results define a novel link between various
transcription factors occupying the COX-2 promoter and cellular response to
cigarette smoke exposure bringing a new component, <U+0394>Np63a, showing a critical
role for cooperation between various chromatin components in regulation of COX-2 
expression and, therefore strengthening the central role of inflammatory process 
in tumorigenesis of epithelial cells, especially after cigarette smoke exposure
(both primary and second-hand.

Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are currently widely used
in cell therapy and tissue engineering. In vitro experiments have demonstrated
that apoptosis of MSCs can be induced by hypoxia, serum deprivation, and
chemotherapeutic agents, and the process is p53 independent. In this study, we
investigated the role of p63 (a member of p53 family) in the regulation of
apoptosis of MSCs. TAp63a, a subtype of p63, is highly similar to p53 and plays a
crucial role in apoptosis. In vitro exposure of MSCs to either cisplatin or
etoposide resulted in an increased TAp63a expression, which was time and dose
dependent. Interference of TAp63a led to drug resistance and decreased apoptosis,
accompanied by reduced expression of Bax, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and
caspase-3. However, downregulation of TAp63a did not influence the phenotype,
proliferation capacity, and differentiation potential of MSCs. These results
indicate that downregulation of TAp63a in MSCs is an attractive strategy to
protect against apoptosis when MSCs are used to support hematopoiesis during bone
marrow transplantation.

The hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the relentless accumulation
of mature lymphocytes, mostly due to their decreased apoptosis. CD74 was recently
shown to serve as a survival receptor on CLL cells. In this study, we show that
stimulation of CD74 with its natural ligand, migration inhibitory factor,
initiates a signaling cascade that results in upregulation of TAp63, which
directly regulates CLL survival. In addition, TAp63 expression elevates the
expression of the integrin VLA-4, particularly during the advanced stage of the
disease. Blocking of CD74, TAp63, or VLA-4 inhibits the in vivo homing of CLL
cells to the bone marrow (BM). Thus, CD74 and its target genes TAp63 and VLA-4
facilitate migration of CLL cells back to the BM, where they interact with the
supportive BM environment that rescues them from apoptosis. These results could
form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking homing of CLL
cells in their return to the BM and attenuating their survival.

Carcinomas may arise as a disorder of regeneration, so that a malignant cell may 
represent a failure to fully attain the characteristics of differentiated tissue.
We hypothesized that there is a differential distribution of progenitor cell
markers among different histological types of lung cancers, with poorly
differentiated tumors being more likely to express progenitor stem cell markers. 
The study was limited to paraffin-embedded archival material of resected
untreated pulmonary carcinomas, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. The sections were
stained for putative stem cells markers (Musashi-1, Musashi-2, CD34, CD21, KIT,
CD133, p63, and OCT-4). Positivity was read as isolated, focal, or diffuse
staining. Stem cell markers were detected in all histological types of pulmonary 
carcinomas. There was a difference in the expression of markers among the
histological types. Small cell carcinoma showed diffuse positivity for most of
the markers; in contrast to focal or negative staining in other histological
groups. An inverse relationship between CD21 and Musashi-1 was observed. No
staining for OCT-4 and CD34 was seen in any of the tumor types. Hierarchical
clustering based on marker expression separated tumors into two groups, with one 
group marked by high expression of Musashi-1 and KIT, contained most of the
poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas. Therefore, stem 
cell markers are expressed in lung cancers with different patterns seen for
different histological types and degrees of differentiation.

p53, p63 and p73 make a family of transcription factors that play a vital role in
development and cancer. All p53 family members have more than one promoter
producing Transactivating (TA) and Dominant Negative (DeltaN) isoforms and their 
mRNAs are subjected to extensive splicing at 3' end to produce multiple protein
products. p53 is usually inactivated by point mutations during tumorigenesis,
whereas the expression levels and p63 and p73 are modulated to give tumor cells a
selective advantage. In this study, aiming to find novel targets of the p53
family members, we identified FGFR3 as a gene transcriptionally controlled by p63
and p73. FGFR3 has been implicated in development and tumor biology as activating
mutations of this gene was described in skeletal disorders, non-invasive skin
conditions and superficial bladder cancers. We found that TAp73, TAp63 and
DeltaNp63 was capable of inducing FGFR3. siRNA mediated downregulation of
DeltaNp63 decreased endogenous FGFR3 protein levels. Our findings of this new
link between p53 family proteins and FGFR3 may help understanding the transition 
of superficial bladder cancers to an invasive phenotype.

Whereas the hallmark of wild-type p53 is its tumor suppressor activity,
tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins can exert novel anti-apoptotic
gain-of-function activities, which confer a selective advantage upon tumor cells 
harboring such mutations. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of mutant p53 
gain-of-function in hepatocellular carcinoma with special emphasis on the
interaction of mutant p53 gain-of-function proteins with the p53 family members
p63 and p73. Mutant forms of p53, namely the hot-spot mutants p53R143A, p53R175D,
p53R175H, p53R248W, and p53R273H, acquire anti-apoptotic gain-of-function in
hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing the activity of genes regulating both, the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway initiated by ligation of death receptors and the
intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In the presence of mutated p53, the
CD95L-CD95 apoptotic pathway is markedly attenuated. This is due to repression of
CD95 gene transcription by mutant p53. In addition, these mutants repress the
expression of the Bax gene and attenuate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
signaling. Furthermore, and of clinical relevance, these gain-of-function mutants
are anti-apoptotic due to their inhibitory interaction with the pro-apoptotic p53
family members TAp63 and TAp73. p53 gain-of-function mutants significantly
decrease activation of pro-apoptotic target genes by wild-type p53, TAp63, and
TAp73. This contributes to the ability of cancer cells to withstand DNA
damage-induced apoptosis. Interference with the interaction of p53
gain-of-function mutants with TAp63 or TAp73 may thus sensitize hepatocellular
carcinoma to elimination by therapy.

Human papillomaviruses modulate expression of microRNA 203 upon epithelial
differentiation to control levels of p63 proteins.

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) link their life cycles to epithelial differentiation
and induce productive replication of viral DNA in suprabasal cells. Viral-DNA
amplification requires cells to remain active in the cell cycle upon
differentiation. This is in contrast to normal cells, which lose proliferative
capability upon differentiation. One factor that negatively regulates
proliferative capability upon differentiation is microRNA 203 (miR-203), which is
expressed primarily in suprabasal epithelial cells. Although HPVs do not encode
their own microRNAs (miRNAs), they modulate expression of cellular miRNAs to
regulate the activities of cellular proteins. We show that the HPV E7 protein
downregulates miR-203 expression upon differentiation, which may occur through
the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. One
target of miR-203 is the p63 family of transcription factors, and we demonstrate 
that HPV-positive cells maintain significantly higher levels of these factors
upon differentiation than do normal keratinocytes. Several downstream targets of 
p63, CARM-1, p21, and Bax, were also increased in E7-expressing cells, and their 
levels were inversely correlated with amounts of miR-203. Introduction of
expression vectors for miR-203 into keratinocytes that stably maintain HPV
episomes resulted in short-term elevation of HPV genome copy numbers, but these
were rapidly lost upon subsequent passage. When HPV-positive cells expressing
high levels of miR-203 were induced to differentiate in methylcellulose, impaired
genome amplification was observed. We conclude that high levels of miR-203 are
inhibitory to HPV amplification and that HPV proteins act to suppress expression 
of this microRNA to allow productive replication in differentiating cells.

ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 interacting protein 1 (ARL6IP1) is an apoptotic
regulator. To investigate the role of ARL6IP1 in human cervical cancer
progression, we designed and used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to inhibit ARL6IP1
expression in CaSki cells and validated its effect on cell proliferation and
invasion. Changes in gene expression were analyzed by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or western blot. Down-regulation
of ARL6IP1 expression by infection with ARL6IP1-specific RNAi-expressing vector
inhibited CaSki cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition,
down-regulation of ARL6IP1 expression arrested CaSki cell cycling at the G0/G1
phase and mitigated CaSki cell migration, determined by wound healing assays.
ARL6IP1 was involved in cervical cancer cell growth, cell cycle progression, and 
invasion through regulation of gene expression, such as Caspase-3, Caspase-9,
p53, TAp63, NF-<U+03BA>B, MAPK, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, suggesting that ARL6IP1 could have
important implications in cervical cancer biology. Our findings illustrate the
biological significance of ARL6IP1 in cervical cancer progression, and provide
novel evidence that ARL6IP1 may serve as a therapeutic target in the prevention
of human cervical cancer.

p53, p63, and p73 are members of the p53 protein family involved in regulation of
cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation, and other critical cellular processes.
Here, we investigated the contribution of the entire p53 family in
chemotherapeutic drug response in gastrointestinal tumors. Real-time PCR and
immunohistochemistry revealed complexity and variability of expression profiles
of the p53 protein family. Using colon and esophageal cancer cells, we found that
the integral transcription activity of the entire p53 family, as measured by the 
reporter analysis, associated with response to drug treatment in studied cells.
We also found that p53 and p73, as well as p63 and p73, bind simultaneously to
the promoters of p53 target genes. Taken together, our results support the view
that the p53 protein family functions as an interacting network of proteins and
show that cellular responses to chemotherapeutic drug treatment are determined by
the total activity of the entire p53 family rather than p53 alone.

INTRODUCTION: The emergence of treatments for non-small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) with differential efficacy and toxicity between subtypes has highlighted 
the importance of specific pathologic NSCLC subtyping. Most NSCLCs are
inoperable, and pathologic diagnosis is made only on small tissue samples that
are prone to diagnostic inaccuracy. In a substantial proportion of cases,
standard morphology cannot specifically subtype the tumor, necessitating a
diagnosis of NSCLC-not otherwise specified (NOS). Histochemical staining for
mucin and immunohistochemical (IHC) identification of NSCLC subtype-associated
markers could help predict the final subtype of resected NSCLCs diagnosed as
NSCLC-NOS on preoperative bronchial biopsy samples.
METHODS: Paraffin sections of 44 bronchial biopsy samples diagnosed as NSCLC-NOS 
were stained for mucin (Alcian blue/periodic acid Schiff) and thyroid
transcription factor 1 by IHC-(markers of adenocarcinoma), and for S100A7,
cytokeratin 5/6, high molecular weight cytokeratins, and p63 proteins-markers of 
squamous cell carcinoma. A predictive staining panel was derived from statistical
analysis after comparing staining profiles with the final postsurgical NSCLC
subtype. This panel was prospectively applied to 82 small biopsy samples
containing NSCLC.
RESULTS: True NSCLC subtype of undifferentiated NSCLC samples was best predicted 
using Alcian blue/periodic acid Schiff plus p63 and thyroid transcription factor 
1 IHC, allowing specific subtyping in 73% of NSCLC-NOS cases with 86% accuracy.
When applied prospectively, this staining panel showed 100% concordance with
specific NSCLC morphologic subtyping in small biopsies.
CONCLUSION: This approach can facilitate treatment selection by accurately
predicting the subtype in undifferentiated NSCLC biopsies, reducing to 7% the
proportion of cases without a definite or probable histologic subtype.

Aberrant activation of Notch receptors has been implicated in breast cancer;
however, the mechanisms contributing to Notch-dependent transformation remain
elusive because Notch displays dichotomous functional activities, promoting both 
proliferation and growth arrest. We investigated the cellular basis for the
heterogeneous responses to Notch pathway activation in 3D cultures of MCF-10A
mammary epithelial cells. Expression of a constitutively active Notch-1
intracellular domain (NICD) was found to induce two distinct types of 3D
structures: large, hyperproliferative structures and small, growth-arrested
structures with reduced cell-to-matrix adhesion. Interestingly, we found that
these heterogeneous phenotypes reflect differences in Notch pathway activation
levels; high Notch activity caused down-regulation of multiple matrix-adhesion
genes and inhibition of proliferation, whereas low Notch activity maintained
matrix adhesion and provoked a strong hyperproliferative response. Moreover,
microarray analyses implicated NICD-induced p63 down-regulation in loss of matrix
adhesion. In addition, a reverse-phase protein array-based analysis and
subsequent loss-of-function studies identified STAT3 as a dominant downstream
mediator of the NICD-induced outgrowth. These results indicate that the
phenotypic responses to Notch are determined by the dose of pathway activation;
and this dose affects the balance between growth-stimulative and
growth-suppressive effects. This unique feature of Notch signaling provides
insights into mechanisms that contribute to the dichotomous effects of Notch
during development and tumorigenesis.

Often the distinction of primary adnexal carcinoma from metastatic adenocarcinoma
to skin from breast, lung, and other sites can be a diagnostic dilemma. Current
markers purportedly of utility as diagnostic adjuncts include p63 and D2-40;
however, their expression has been demonstrated in 11-22% and 5% of metastatic
cutaneous metastases, respectively. Both cytokeratin (CK) 15 and nestin have been
reported as follicular stem cell markers. We performed CK15 and nestin, as well
as previously reported stains (such as p63, D2-40, and calretinin) on 113 cases
(59 primary adnexal carcinomas and 54 cutaneous metastases). Expressions of p63, 
CK15, nestin, D2-40, and calretinin were observed in 91, 40, 37, 44, and 14% of
primary adnexal carcinoma, respectively, and in 8, 2, 8, 4, and 10% of cutaneous 
metastases, respectively. p63 appeared to be the most sensitive marker (with a
sensitivity of 91%) in detecting primary adnexal carcinomas. CK15 appeared to be 
the most specific marker with a specificity of 98%. Using chi(2) analysis,
statistically significant P-values (<0.05) were observed for p63, CK15, nestin,
and D2-40 in the distinction of primary adnexal carcinoma versus cutaneous
metastases. In logistic regression and stepwise selection for predicting a
primary adnexal carcinoma, statistical significance was observed for p63, CK15,
and D2-40 (P-values: <0.001, 0.0275, and 0.0298, respectively) but not for nestin
(P-value=0.4573). Our study indicates that diagnostic sensitivity and specificity
are significantly improved using a selected panel of immunohistochemical markers,
including p63, CK15, and D2-40. Positive staining with all three markers argues
in favor of a primary cutaneous adnexal neoplasm.

Ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome is an uncommon disorder that 
includes a clinical spectrum of limb, facial, ocular, internal ear, and
urogenital malformations. The disease is caused by heterozygous mutations in the 
3q27-29 located p63 gene. In this paper we describe a 17-year-old girl affected
by ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome with a de novo p63
mutation that predicts a heterozygous missense substitution (arginine to
tryptophan substitution caused by a cytosine to thymine transition) at the amino 
acid 304 (R304W) of the p63 DNA-binding domain. Scattered freckles on face, legs,
and abdominal region, an uncommon feature associated with this syndrome, were
recognized in our patient. The clinical features and genotype-phenotype
correlation with previous p63 mutations related to the syndrome are discussed and
compared with those observed in our patient. This case expands the phenotypic
spectrum of ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease is a human tropical parasitic illness and a subset of
the chronic patients develop megaesophagus or megacolon. The esophagus dilation
is known as chagasic megaesophagus (CM) and one of the severe late consequences
of CM is the increased risk for esophageal carcinoma (ESCC). Based on the
association between CM and ESCC, we investigated whether genes frequently showing
unbalanced copy numbers in ESCC were altered in CM by fluorescence in situ (FISH)
technology.
METHODS: A total of 50 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal mucosa
specimens (40 from Chagas megaesophagus-CM, and 10 normal esophageal mucosa-NM)
were analyzed. DNA FISH probes were tested for FHIT, TP63, PIK3CA, EGFR, FGFR1,
MYC, CDKN2A, YES1 and NCOA3 genes, and centromeric sequences from chromosomes 3, 
7 and 9.
RESULTS: No differences between superficial and basal layers of the epithelial
mucosa were found, except for loss of copy number of EGFR in the esophageal basal
layer of CM group. Mean copy number of CDKN2A and CEP9 and frequency of nuclei
with loss of PIK3CA were significantly different in the CM group compared with
normal mucosa and marginal levels of deletions in TP63, FHIT, PIK3CA, EGFR,
CDKN2A, YES and gains at PIK3CA, TP63, FGFR1, MYC, CDNK2A and NCOA3 were detected
in few CM cases, mainly with dilation grades III and IV. All changes occurred at 
very low levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Genomic imbalances common in esophageal carcinomas are not present
in chagasic megaesophagus suggesting that these features will not be effective
markers for risk assessment of ESCC in patients with chagasic megaesophagus.

Bladder cancer is the 5th commonest cancer and two major risk factors are smoking
and occupational chemical exposure. There is also evidence of a genetic component
to its aetiology. Candidate gene studies have mostly focused on genes involved in
adduct metabolism and DNA repair, including a recent consortium-based
meta-analysis. Recently, two genome-wide association studies in bladder cancer
have been published and a third is awaited with interest. These first two studies
have identified three SNPs of genome-wide significance, two located within the
8q24 'gene desert'. These SNPs are positioned near or within loci of genes
potentially implicated in cancer predisposition, namely MYC, TP63 and PSCA,
although the functional significance of this is as yet unclear.

TP63 is a p53-related gene that contains two alternative promoters, which give
rise to transcripts that encode proteins with (TAp63) or without (DeltaNp63) an
amino-transactivating domain. Whereas the expression of p63 is required for
proper development of epithelial structures, the role of p63 in tumorigenesis
remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of Snail and Slug transcription
factors, known to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions during
development and cancer, in the regulation of p63 isoforms in human squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC). In the present study, we observed that the expressions of DeltaN
and TAp63 isoforms were, respectively, down- and up-regulated by both Snail and
Slug. However, the induction of TAp63 was not directly caused by these two
transcription factors but resulted from the loss of DeltaNp63, which acts as
dominant-negative inhibitor of TAp63. In SCC cell lines and cancer tissues, high 
expression of Snail and Slug was also significantly associated with altered p63
expression. Finally, we showed that DeltaNp63 silencing reduced cell-cell
adhesion and increased the migratory properties of cancer cells. These data
suggest that the disruption of p63 expression induced by Snail and Slug plays a
crucial role in tumor progression. Therefore, p63 and its regulating factors
could constitute novel prognosis markers in patients with SCC and attractive
targets for the therapeutic modulation of neoplastic cell invasiveness.

The p53 family gene p63 plays an instrumental role in cellular stress responses
including responses to DNA damage. In addition to encoding a full-length
transcriptional activator, p63 also encodes several dominant inhibitory isoforms 
including the isoform DeltaNp63alpha, the function of which is not fully
understood. DeltaNp63alpha is degraded in response to DNA damage, thereby
enabling an effective cellular response to genotoxic agents. Here, we identify a 
key molecular mechanism underlying regulation of DeltaNp63alpha expression in
response to chemotherapeutic agents or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We found that
DeltaNp63alpha interacts with IkappaB kinase (IKK), a multisubunit protein kinase
that consists of two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory
subunit, IKKgamma. The IKKbeta kinase promotes ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation of DeltaNp63alpha, whereas a kinase-deficient mutant IKKbeta-K44A
fails to do so. Cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced stimulation of IKKbeta caused
degradation of DeltaNp63alpha and augmented transactivation of p53 family-induced
genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. Conversely, IKKbeta
inhibition attenuated cytokine- or chemotherapy-induced degradation of
DeltaNp63alpha. Our findings show that IKKbeta plays an essential role in
regulating DeltaNp63alpha in response to extrinsic stimuli. IKK activation
represents one mechanism by which levels of DeltaNp63alpha can be reduced,
thereby rendering cells susceptible to cell death in the face of cellular stress 
or DNA damage.

(CKR-HMW) and p63 in prostate trepan biopsy specimens for establishing the
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma].

Raskin GA.

Early diagnosis of prostate cancer is one of the most important problems of
modern oncology. Trepan biopsy and further histological investigation are the
standards for examination of patients with prostate neoplasms. Our investigations
of 56 cases have indicated that in 27% of the cases, histological investigation
is insufficient to make a valid diagnosis. In such cases, immunohistochemical
evaluation of the expression of high-molecular-weight cytokeratins and p63 allows
differentiation of carcinoma from benign masses of the prostate, which may be
used to enhance the efficiency of early diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Craniopharyngiomas are rare, histologically benign, non-neuroepithelial
epithelial tumors arising from the sellar region, the molecular pathogenesis of
CPs is yet not understood. The aim of the present study was to assess expression 
of aberrant beta-catenin and impaired p63 in 66 craniopharyngiomas included 51
adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas and 15 squamous papillary craniopharyngiomas.
On immunohistochemistry, 47 out of 51 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas, but
not squamous papillary craniopharyngiomas, showed strong nuclear/cytoplasmic
expression for beta-catenin predominantly in compactly cohesive epithelial cells 
within the whorl-like arrays where ki-67 was almost absent and rarely in
palisaded cells where ki-67 was mainly present. P63 overexpression was observed
in 45 out of 51 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas and 14 out of 15 squamous
papillary craniopharyngiomas. P63 stained not only in the nuclei of basal layer
cells but also within the whorl-like arrays in adamantinomatous
craniopharyngiomas and uniformly in squamous papillary craniopharyngiomas. Using 
quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction techniques to correlate p63
protein expression with p63 mRNA levels, TAp63 isoforms mRNA was reduced, whereas
DeltaNp63 mRNA elevated at levels in 5 snap frozen tissue samples with multiple
large p63 positive cell clusters compared with normal tissues. In conclusion, the
present study confirmed that the two variants of CPs have genetically not only
distinctive but also common feature. It demonstrated that cytoplasm/nuclear
beta-catenin accumulation is an exclusively characteristic morphology of adaCPs. 
P63 immunohistochemical overexpression were found in both adaCPs and spCPs
variant when analyzed in the same study. Taken together, the impaired p63
expression may be attributed to elevated DeltaNp63 mRNA and reduced TAp63mRNA in 
CPs.

TP63 gene is a member of TP53 tumor suppressor gene family that encodes several
protein isoforms involved in the process of epithelial stratification and in
epithelial-mesenchyme interactions. TP63 is amplified in a significant proportion
of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC), resulting in the
hyper-expression of DeltaNp63 as the major p63 isoform. To better understand the 
contribution of this high expression to tumorigenesis, we have analyzed the
impact of intraepithelial p63 expression on the expression of cell adhesion
complexes in normal esophagus and in ESCC cell lines. Cells expressing p63 showed
an adhesion pattern characterized by lack of tight junctions and presence of
adherens junctions. Cell differentiation was accompanied by a decrease in p63 and
by a shift to adhesion patterns involving tight junctions. Silencing of p63 mRNA 
in ESCC cell lines resulted in a similar shift, characterized by increased
expression of component of tight junctions, decreased cell-to-cell communication 
and downregulation of cell proliferation. These results indicate that DeltaNp63
may contribute to esophageal squamous carcinogenesis by maintaining cell adhesion
patterns compatible with cell proliferation.

The p53 homologue p63/TP73L is required for the proper development of squamous
epithelia, mammary glands and limb buds, with some of these tissues also
displaying strong canonical Wnt signalling activity. It was previously suggested 
that DeltaNp63alpha, the predominant isoform of p63 in epithelia, positively
regulates beta-Catenin through inhibition of GSK3beta. Results reported in this
communication show that, upon transient overexpression, DeltaNp63alpha indeed
promotes Wnt-inducible reporter gene activity in human cells, as well as
secondary axis formation in Xenopus embryos. However, in apparent contradiction
to these observations, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous p63 equally
enhanced the expression of Wnt-responsive genes. While p63 knockdown did not
detectably affect beta-Catenin levels or phosphorylation, DeltaNp63alpha was
found in a complex with members of the TCF/LEF family of Wnt-responsive
transcription factors. On The basis of these findings, we propose that
DeltaNp63alpha has a function in recruiting transcriptional repressors to
Wnt-responsive genes. Overexpression of p63 may lead to sequestration of such
repressors (squelching), resulting in a similar effect like siRNA-mediated
removal of p63, i.e., activation of Wnt-responsive genes. The role of p63 as a
negative Wnt-regulator thus matches with the frequently observed downregulation
of p63 during tumor progression, when cancer cells adopt a more mesenchymal,
invasive phenotype.

A genome-wide, whole brain approach to investigate genetic effects on
neuroimaging phenotypes for identifying quantitative trait loci is described. The
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and genetic dataset was
investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer parcellation
followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). One hundred forty-two
measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were
extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each
phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of
620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175
AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC).
Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and
associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p<10(-7) and p<10(-6)).
As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly
associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the
EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes. Detailed image analyses of rs6463843 (flanking
NXPH1) revealed reduced global and regional GM density across diagnostic groups
in TT relative to GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis indicated that AD patients
homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right
hippocampal GM density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of
adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity, the
loss of which is a hallmark of AD. A genome-wide, whole brain search strategy has
the potential to reveal novel candidate genes and loci warranting further
investigation and replication.

Cutaneous sclerosing epithelial neoplasms are often difficult to diagnose. Though
various immunohistochemical markers have proved useful, some cases remain a
diagnostic challenge. We aimed to assess the utility of p63 immunohistochemical
staining in distinguishing microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) from sclerosing
basal cell carcinoma (SBCC) and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (DTE). Biopsy
samples from 20 SBCC, 10 DTE, and 5 MAC were examined after immunohistochemical
staining with p63. Although all adnexal tumors examined demonstrated p63
expression, the pattern of staining was strikingly different in MAC when compared
with other tumor types. MAC exhibited a scattered pattern with p63-positive cells
around the periphery of tumor nests and minimal staining within the center of the
tumor islands. This pattern was more pronounced at increased depth of
infiltration into the dermis. A robust and consistent diffuse pattern of staining
with p63 was observed in all SBCCs and DTEs. We believe this pattern reflects the
multi-differentiation pathway of MAC, with eccrine/sebaceous differentiation
occurring at deeper levels of the dermis. The different staining patterns of MACs
compared with DTEs and SBCCs can thus serve asa useful diagnostic adjunct in
difficult lesions.

The role of paracrine tumor-stroma regulation in the progression of cancer is
under intense investigation. Activated fibroblasts are key components of the
tumor microenvironment providing the soluble factors mediating the regulation.
Nemosis is an experimental model to study these parameters: formation of a
multicellular spheroid activates fibroblasts and leads to increased production of
soluble factors involved in the promotion of growth and motility. Role of nemosis
was investigated in the tumorigenesis of HaCaT derivatives representing skin
carcinoma progression. Conditioned medium from fibroblast spheroids increased
proliferation rate of HaCaT derivatives. Expression of proliferation marker Ki-67
increased significantly in benign A5 and low-grade malignant II-4 cells, but did 
not further increase in the metastatic RT3 cells. Expression of p63, keratinocyte
stem cell marker linked to cancer progression, was augmented by medium from
nemotic fibroblasts; this increase was also seen in RT3 cells. Scratch-wound
healing of the keratinocytes was enhanced in response to fibroblast nemosis.
Neutralizing antibodies against growth factors inhibited wound healing to some
extent; the response varied between benign and malignant keratinocytes. Migration
and invasion were enhanced by conditioned medium from nemotic fibroblasts in
benign and low-grade malignant cells. RT3 keratinocyte migration was further
augmented, but invasion was not, indicating their intrinsic capacity to invade.
Our data demonstrate that fibroblast nemosis increases proliferation and motility
of HaCaT keratinocyte derivatives, and thus nemosis can be used as a model to
study the role of soluble factors secreted by fibroblasts in tumor progression.

Regulating the genome surveillance system: miRNAs and the p53 super family.

The p53 gene super family consists of three members; TP53, TP63 and TP73,
encoding proteins p53, p63 and p73. Whilst p63 appears to have an essential role 
in embryonic development with a less clear role in carcinogenesis, irregularities
in p53 and p73 signalling are implicated in tumour formation. As such, p53 is a
tumour suppressor which is mutated in over 50% cancers and p73 was recently
formally classified as a tumour suppressor based on data showing p73 deficient
mice generate spontaneous tumours similar to those observed in p53 null mice.
Dysregulation of both p53 and p73 has been correlated with cancer progression in 
many cell types and although mutation of these genes is often observed, some form
of p53/p73 deregulation likely occurs in all tumour cells. The discovery that
complementary micro RNAs (miRNAs) are able to target both of these genes provides
a potential new means of perturbing p53/p73 signalling networks in cancer cells. 
Here we summarise the current literature regarding the involvement of miRNAs in
the modulation of p53 family proteins and cancer development and detail the use
of in silico methods to reveal key miRNA targets.

p63, a transcription factor related to the p53 tumor suppressor, plays a key role
in epidermal differentiation and limb development. The gene has two distinct
promoters that allow the formation of proteins that either contain (TA) or lack
(DeltaN) a transactivation domain. DeltaNp63alpha is the most widely expressed
isoform, at all stages of development and in adult tissues. It supports the
regenerative capacity of basal keratinocytes and its upregulation is a hallmark
of human squamous carcinomas. To get insight into the complex biology of
DeltaNp63alpha, we set out to identify DeltaNp63alpha interacting proteins by
co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells and mass spectrometry analysis. A total
of 49 potential DeltaNp63alpha binding proteins, including several heterogeneous 
ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), were identified. Integration of the proteomic data
with a Human Coexpression Network highlighted 5 putative p63 protein interactors 
whose expression is significantly comodulated with p63: hnRNPA/B, hnRNPK, hnRNPQ,
FUS/TLS and Keratin 5. hnRNPA/B was already described as a p63 partner, but the
others were novel. Interaction of DeltaNp63alpha with hnRNPQ, hnRNPK and FUS/TLS 
was confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations in human keratinocytes. The
finding that DeltaNp63alpha exists in complexes with several RNA-binding proteins
lays the premises for the analysis of the role of DeltaNp63alpha in mRNA
metabolism and transport.

The p53homolog p63has emerged as a gene with an enormously complex function that 
is distinct from that of p53. It encodes two distinct transcript isoforms that
have a dramatic impact on replenishment of cutaneous epithelial stem cells and on
ovarian germ cell survival. However, although these two fundamental roles of p63 
attest to its powerful place in development, its other functions-specifically the
apparent capacity of p63, when induced, to supervise the emergence of new cell
populations in the breast, prostate, cervix, and upper reproductive tract-are
shared by embryo and adult. These observed functions may only scratch the surface
of a repertoire that has been postulated to encompass a range of cellular
activities, as evidenced by the fact that p63 proteins have been shown to
potentially bind to over 5800 target sites. Whether tumorigenic pathways are also
involved, and to what extent, is a subject of both promise and controversy that
remains to be resolved.

The p53 family of transcription factors is made up of p53, p63 and p73, which
share significant structural homology. In particular, transcriptional complexity 
and the expression of multiple protein isoforms are an emergent trait of all
family members. p63 is the evolutionarily eldest member of the p53 family and the
various isoforms have critical roles in the development of stratifying epithelia.
Recent results have uncovered additional splice variants, adding to the
complexity of the transcriptional architecture of p63. These observations and the
emerging extensive interplay between p63 and p53 in development, proliferation
and differentiation underline the importance of considering all isoforms and
family members in studies of the function of p53 family members.

INTRODUCTION: The dichotomization of non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) subtype
into squamous (SQCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) has become important in recent
years and is increasingly required with regard to management. The aim of this
study was to determine the utility of a panel of commercially available
antibodies in refining the diagnosis on small biopsies and also to determine
whether cytologic material is suitable for somatic EGFR genotyping in a
prospectively analyzed series of patients undergoing investigation for suspected 
lung cancer.
METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive cases of NSCLC were first tested using a panel
comprising cytokeratin 5/6, P63, thyroid transcription factor-1, 34betaE12, and a
D-PAS stain for mucin, to determine their value in refining diagnosis of NSCLC.
After this test phase, two further pathologists independently reviewed the cases 
using a refined panel that excluded 34betaE12 because of its low specificity for 
SQCC, and refinement of diagnosis and concordance were assessed. Ten cases of
ADC, including eight derived from cytologic samples, were sent for EGFR mutation 
analysis.
RESULTS: There was refinement of diagnosis in 65% of cases of NSCLC to either
SQCC or ADC in the test phase. This included 10 of 13 cases where cell pellets
had been prepared from transbronchial needle aspirates. Validation by two further
pathologists with varying expertise in lung pathology confirmed increased
refinement and concordance of diagnosis. All samples were adequate for analysis, 
and they all showed a wild-type EGFR genotype.
CONCLUSION: A panel comprising cytokeratin 5/6, P63, thyroid transcription
factor-1, and a D-PAS stain for mucin increases diagnostic accuracy and agreement
between pathologists when faced with refining a diagnosis of NSCLC to SQCC or
ADC. These small samples, even cell pellets derived from transbronchial needle
aspirates, seem to be adequate for EGFR mutation analysis.

TAp63 is a transcriptional target of NF-kappaB.

The p53 homologue p63 encodes multiple protein isoforms either with (TA) or
without (DeltaN) the N-terminal transactivation domain. Accumulating evidence
indicates that TAp63 plays an important role in various biological processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, how TAp63 
is regulated remains largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that
NF-kappaB induces TAp63 gene expression. The responsible elements for
NF-kappaB-mediated TAp63 induction are located within the region from -784 to
-296 bp in the TAp63 promoter, which contains two NF-kappaB binding sites.
Ectopic expression of RelA stimulates TAp63 promoter-driven reporter activity and
increases endogenous TAp63 mRNA levels. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by IkappaBalpha
super-repressor or with a chemical inhibitor leads to down regulation of TAp63
mRNA expression and activity. In addition, mutations in the critical
NF-kappaB-binding sites significantly abolish the effects of NF-kappaB on TAp63. 
Activation of NF-kappaB by TNFalpha enhances p50/RelA binding to the NF-kappaB
binding sites. Furthermore, we show that an Sp1 site adjacent to the NF-kappaB
sites plays a role in NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of TAp63. Taken together,
these data reveal that TAp63 is a transcriptional target of NF-kappaB, which may 
play a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival upon NF-kappaB
activation by various stimuli.

TAp63 belongs to the p53-tumour suppressor family and is capable of
transactivating a set of target genes to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 
We showed that treatment of cancer cells with chemo-therapeutic drugs or the
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) results in induction of
TAp63 expression, which is in turn related with chemosensitivity. Indeed,
induction of TAp63 by TSA affects sensitivity to chemo-therapeutic drugs via the 
cleavage of the trans-inhibitory domain of TAp63 by active caspases, resulting in
generation of a transcriptionally hyper-active TAp63 fragment. Therefore
therapeutic approaches that enhance TAp63 expression may offer an improvement in 
the management of chemoresistant tumours. In this study we tested the abilities
of different HDAC inhibitors to induce TAp63 expression. We discovered that two
HDAC inhibitors belonging to the hydroxamate group, namely TSA and LBH589, are
the most efficient inducers of TAp63 expression. Finally, we found that induction
of TAp63 expression in HCT116 cells depends on p53, as p53-negative HCT116 cells 
failed to induce significant TAp63 expression following treatment with different 
HDAC inhibitors.

Large-scale culture of primary keratinocytes allows the production of large
epidermal sheet surfaces for the treatment of extensive skin burns. This method
is dependent upon the capacity to establish cultures of proliferating
keratinocytes in conditions compatible with their clonal expansion while
maintaining their capacity to differentiate into the typical squamous pattern of 
human epidermis. Feeder layers are critical in this process because the
fibroblasts that compose this layer serve as a source of adhesion, growth and
differentiation factors. In this report, we have characterise the expression
patterns of p63 isoforms in primary keratinocytes cultured on two different
feeder layer systems, murine 3T3 and human fibroblasts. We show that with the
latter, keratinocytes express a higher ratio of Delta N to TAp63 isoform, in
relation with higher clonogenic potential. These results indicate that human
fibroblasts represent an adequate feeder layer system to support the culture of
primary human keratinocytes.

The transcription factor p63 is expressed as at least six different isoforms, of 
which two have been assigned critical biological roles within ectodermal
development and skin stem cell biology on the one hand and supervision of the
genetic stability of oocytes on the other hand. These two isoforms contain a
C-terminal inhibitory domain that negatively regulates their transcriptional
activity. This inhibitory domain contains two individual components: one that
uses an internal binding mechanism to interact with and mask the transactivation 
domain and one that is based on sumoylation. We have carried out an extensive
alanine scanning study to identify critical regions within the inhibitory domain.
These experiments show that a stretch of ~13 amino acids is crucial for the
binding function. Further, investigation of transcriptional activity and the
intracellular level of mutants that cannot be sumoylated suggests that
sumoylation reduces the concentration of p63. We therefore propose that the
inhibitory function of the C-terminal domain is in part due to direct inhibition 
of the transcriptional activity of the protein and in part due to indirect
inhibition by controlling the concentration of p63.

c-Abl phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a is critical for cell viability.

The p53 family member p63 has been shown to be critical for growth, proliferation
and chemosensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the c-Abl tyrosine kinase
phosphorylates the widely expressed <U+0394>Np63a isoform and identify multiple sites by
mass spectrometry in vitro and in vivo. Phopshorylation by c-Abl results in
greater protein stability of both ectopically expressed and endogenous <U+0394>Np63a.
c-Abl phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a induces its binding to Yes-associated protein
(YAP) and silencing of YAP by siRNA reduces the c-Abl-induced increase of <U+0394>Np63a 
levels. We further show that cisplatin induces c-Abl phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a
and its binding to YAP. Overexpression of <U+0394>Np63a, but not the c-Abl phosphosites 
mutant, protects cells from cisplatin treatment. Finally, we demonstrate the
rescue of p63 siRNA-mediated loss of viability with p63siRNA insensitive
construct of <U+0394>Np63a but not the phosphosites mutant. These results demonstrate
that c-Abl phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a regulates its protein stability, by inducing
binding of YAP, and is critical for cell viability.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors activate their target genes by binding to
specific response elements. Many transcription factor families evolved from a
common ancestor by gene duplication and subsequent divergent evolution. Members
of the p53 family, which play key roles in cell-cycle control and development,
share conserved DNA binding and oligomerisation domains but exhibit distinct
functions. In this study, the molecular basis of the functional divergence of
related transcription factors was investigated.
RESULTS: We characterised the DNA-binding specificity and oligomerisation
properties of human p53, p63 and p73, as well as p53 from other organisms using
novel biophysical approaches. All p53 family members bound DNA cooperatively as
tetramers with high affinity. Despite structural differences in the
oligomerisation domain, the dissociation constants of the tetramers was in the
low nanomolar range for all family members, indicating that the strength of
tetramerisation was evolutionarily conserved. However, small differences in the
oligomerisation properties were observed, which may play a regulatory role.
Intriguingly, the DNA-binding specificity of p53 family members was highly
conserved even for evolutionarily distant species. Additionally, DNA recognition 
was only weakly affected by CpG methylation. Prediction of p53/p63/p73 binding
sites in the genome showed almost complete overlap between the different
homologs.
CONCLUSION: Diversity of biological function of p53 family members is not
reflected in differences in sequence-specific DNA binding. Hence, additional
specificity factors must exist, which allowed the acquisition of novel functions 
during evolution while preserving original roles.

Cisplatin remains the most important chemotherapeutic agent for patients with
human head and neck cancer. However, tumor cells often develop resistance to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We previously found that head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) cells exposed to cisplatin display a marked ATM-induced
phosphorylation of DeltaNp63alpha. However, the mutated Np63-S385G failed to
undergo phosphorylation by ATM kinase. We used HNSCC cell lines expressing the
wild type DeltaNp63alpha or mutated DeltaNp63alpha-S385G to determine the effect 
of S385G mutation on the DeltaNp63alpha transcriptional activity and
protein-protein interactions. The S385G mutation in DeltaNp63alpha dramatically
abolished the upregulation/downregulation of downstream gene targets and the
binding of DeltaNp63alpha-S385G to certain promoters. In contrast to the
non-phosphorylated DeltaNp63alpha-S385G, the phospho-DeltaNp63alpha forms
protein-protein complexes with NF-YA transcription factor and regulates the
transcription of DDIT3 gene implicated in the programmed cell death of HNSCC
cells upon cisplatin exposure. We suggest that the transcriptional activation of 
DeltaNp63alpha through its phosphorylation by ATM kinase in HNSCC cells exposed
to cisplatin is a critical step in the subsequent sensitivity of certain human
head and neck cancers to platinum therapy.

Lymphadenoma of the salivary gland is a rare benign tumor with only 11 reported
cases in the English language literature, most of which have occurred in adults. 
We report a case of a lymphadenoma occurring in the parotid gland of a
15-year-old girl. The tumor was composed of variably sized cystic cavities within
abundant reactive lymphoid tissue. The cystic spaces were filled with
eosinophilic secretions with occasional histiocytes. Many of these features were 
also apparent on cytologic preparations. The cysts were lined by epithelium
lacking atypia and showed luminal and abluminal differentiation both by
immunohistochemistry and by electron microscopy. Tumor cells were not cycling as 
determined by MIB1 immunostaining, and the tumor karyotype was normal. This is
only the second case to be reported in the pediatric age group. Ultrastructural
features and karyotype analysis are reported for the first time. Although this
tumor is rarely encountered by pediatric pathologists, awareness of its existence
is important to distinguish it from possible malignant mimics, such as
lymphoepithelial carcinoma and metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma in a lymph
node.

Regulation of DeltaNp63alpha can be achieved at the transcriptional and
post-translational levels, with the latter being greatly influenced by external
stimuli such as DNA damaging agents. In this present study, we demonstrated that 
DeltaNp63alpha physical interacts with Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1). Ectopic
expression of Yap1 decreased the stability and the half-like of DeltaNp63alpha
and resulted in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of DeltaNp63alpha. Further, the
cisplatin mediated degradation of DeltaNp63alpha is attenuated with the
downregulation of Yap1. Thus, our results strongly suggest that Yap1 plays a role
in the regulation of endogenous DeltaNp63alpha levels and is likely to contribute
to the regulation of DeltaNp63alpha, in physiological conditions.

p63 plays a critical role in normal development and maintenance of stratified
epithelia, including the urothelium. In the normal urothelium, urothelial cells
in the basal layers abundantly express the predominant p63 isoform
DeltaNp63alpha. We previously showed that (a) DeltaNp63alpha expression at the
similar level to the normal urothelium is retained in most low-grade papillary
noninvasive (LPN) tumors, whereas frequently lost in high-grade invasive
carcinomas, and that (b) loss of DeltaNp63alpha is associated with poor prognosis
of invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma patients. However, a functional role of 
DeltaNp63alpha in progression of urothelial carcinomas remains to be elucidated. 
Here, we show that loss of DeltaNp63alpha expression promotes invasion of
urothelial carcinoma cells. In 5637 cells substantially expressing only
DeltaNp63alpha isoform at the protein level, knockdown of endogenous p63
upregulated N-cadherin, which recruited more Src homology and collagen to
N-cadherin and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling,
and consequently potentiated cell motility, excretion of matrix
metalloproteinase-9, and invasion. In T24 cells originally lacking endogenous
DeltaNp63alpha expression, exogenous expression of DeltaNp63alpha attenuated
invasion by downregulating N-cadherin expression and ERK activity, confirming an 
invasion-suppressive role of DeltaNp63alpha in urothelial carcinoma cells. We
further documented loss of DeltaNp63 expression accompanied by N-cadherin
upregulation during muscle-invasive recurrence in patients whose bladder cancer
had progressed from LPN tumors to muscle-invasive disease. These results suggest 
that loss of DeltaNp63alpha and subsequent upregulation of N-cadherin is one of
the mechanisms underlying progression of bladder cancer.

Research has shown that the inclusion of a fibroblast cell support layer is
required for the isolation and expansion of primary keratinocytes. Recent
advances have provided keratinocyte culture with fibroblast-free alternatives.
However, these technologies are often undefined and rely on the incorporation of 
purified proteins/components. To address this problem we developed a medium that 
used recombinant proteins to support the serum-free isolation and expansion of
human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The human dermal fibroblasts were
able to be isolated serum free by adding recombinant human albumin to a
collagenase solution. These fibroblasts were then expanded using a serum-free
medium containing recombinant proteins: epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast
growth factor, chimeric vitronectin:insulin-like growth factor-I protein, and
recombinant human albumin. These fibroblasts maintained a typical morphology and 
expressed fibroblast markers during their serum-free isolation, expansion, and
freezing. Moreover, these fibroblasts were able to support the serum-free
isolation and expansion of primary keratinocytes using these recombinant
proteins. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis
confirmed that there were no differences in expression levels of p63 or keratins 
1, 6, and 10 when keratinocytes were grown in either serum-supplemented or
serum-free medium. Using a three-dimensional human skin equivalent model we
demonstrated that these keratinocytes also maintained their ability to reform an 
epidermal layer. In summary, the techniques described provide a valuable
alternative for culturing fibroblasts and keratinocytes using recombinant
proteins.

The growth-promoting effect of KGF on limbal epithelial cells is mediated by

Corneal epithelial stem cells are thought to reside in the limbus, the transition
zoon between cornea and conjunctiva. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are two paracrine factors that regulate the
proliferation, migration and differentiation of the limbal epithelial cells;
however, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In an ex vivo
limbal explant culture, we found that KGF is a more potent growth stimulator for 
the epithelial outgrowth than HGF. Immunofluorescence studies of the epithelial
outgrowth from cells treated with HGF or KGF showed similar expression patterns
of keratin-3 and keratin-14. Interestingly, p63 was highly expressed in
KGF-treated limbal epithelial sheets but not in those treated with HGF. Kinase
inhibitor studies showed that induction of DeltaNp63alpha expression by KGF is
mediated via the p38 pathway. The effect of KGF on limbal epithelial outgrowth
was significantly reduced when endogenous DeltaNp63alpha was suppressed,
suggesting that KGF-induced limbal epithelial outgrowth is dependent on the
expression of DeltaNp63alpha. Our findings strongly suggest that limbal
keratocytes regulate limbal epithelial cell growth and differentiation through a 
KGF paracrine loop, with DeltaNp63alpha expression as one of the downstream
targets.

Summary EEC (ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting; OMIM 604292) syndrome 
is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder. Characteristic clinical features
comprise abnormalities in several ectodermal structures including skin, hair,
teeth, nails and sweat glands as well as orofacial clefting and limb defects.
Pathogenic mutations in the TP63 transcription factor have been identified as the
molecular basis of EEC syndrome and to date 34 mutations have been reported. The 
majority of mutations involve heterozygous missense mutations in the DNA-binding 
domain of TP63, a region critical for direct interactions with DNA target
sequences. In this report, we present an overview of EEC syndrome, discuss the
role of TP63 in embryonic development and skin homeostasis, and report five new
TP63 gene mutations. We highlight the significant intra- and interfamilial
phenotypic variability in affected individuals and outline the emerging paradigm 
for genotype-phenotype correlation in this inherited ectodermal dysplasia
syndrome.

P63 is a member of the p53 family. This protein is crucial for the maintenance of
a stem cell population in the human epithelium and necessary for the normal
development of all epithelial tissues including mammary glands. In normal breast 
tissue, the p63 seems to be a specific myoepithelial cell marker. P63 expression 
has been described in highly aggressive ER negative basal-like breast tumors. The
value of p63 expression in ER positive disease is less clear. The expression
levels of p63 mRNA by Affymetrix microarray analysis in a combined cohort of
2,158 ER positive breast cancers and its prognostic and predictive impact were
analyzed. Tumor samples containing large amounts of benign breast tissue, which
will interfere with p63 measurement, were excluded prior to the analysis.
Survival analysis revealed a better prognosis of ER positive breast cancer
expressing p63 (n = 410; P < 0.036). No correlation of p63 with standard
parameters was observed. In a subgroup analysis, endocrine-treated patients with 
high p63 expression showed a better prognosis than low p63 expression (P = 0.06; 
n = 186). In untreated patients, this effect was less clear (n = 148; P = 0.5).
P63 is a positive prognostic factor in endocrine-treated ER positive breast
cancer and might influence responsiveness to endocrine treatment. Thus, p63 could
be helpful as a predictive factor for endocrine therapy.

p63 is distinct from its homologue p53 in that its role as a tumour suppressor is
controversial, an issue complicated by the existence of two classes of p63
isoforms. Here we show that TAp63 isoforms are robust mediators of senescence
that inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo. Whereas gain of TAp63 induces senescence,
loss of p63 enhances sarcoma development in mice lacking p53. Using a new
TAp63-specific conditional mouse model, we demonstrate that TAp63 isoforms are
essential for Ras-induced senescence, and that TAp63 deficiency increases
proliferation and enhances Ras-mediated oncogenesis in the context of p53
deficiency in vivo. TAp63 induces senescence independently of p53, p19(Arf) and
p16(Ink4a), but requires p21(Waf/Cip1) and Rb. TAp63-mediated senescence
overrides Ras-driven transformation of p53-deficient cells, preventing tumour
initiation, and doxycycline-regulated expression of TAp63 activates
p21(Waf/Cip1), induces senescence and inhibits progression of established tumours
in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that TAp63 isoforms function as tumour
suppressors by regulating senescence through p53-independent pathways. The
ability of TAp63 to trigger senescence and halt tumorigenesis irrespective of p53
status identifies TAp63 as a potential target of anti-cancer therapy for human
malignancies with compromised p53.

Accumulating evidence indicates that TBP (TATA-binding protein)-like protein
(TLP) contributes to the regulation of stress-mediated cell cycle checkpoint and 
apoptotic pathways, although its physiological target genes have remained
elusive. In the present study, we have demonstrated that human TAp63 is one of
the direct transcriptional target genes of TLP. Enforced expression of TLP
results in the transcriptional induction of the endogenous TAp63, but not of the 
other p53 family members such as TAp73 and p53. Consistent with these results,
small interference RNA-mediated knockdown led to a significant down-regulation of
the endogenous TAp63. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that the genomic region located at positions -487 to -29, where
+1 represents the transcriptional initiation site of TAp63, is required for
TLP-dependent transcriptional activation of TAp63 and also TLP is efficiently
recruited onto this region. Additionally, cells treated with anti-cancer drug
etoposide underwent apoptosis in association with the transcriptional enhancement
of TAp63 in a p53-independent manner, and the knockdown of the endogenous TLP
reduced etoposide-induced apoptosis through repression of TAp63 expression. Taken
together, our present study identifies a TLP-TAp63 pathway that is further
implicated in stress-induced apoptosis.

Cultured keratinocytes (KC) are needed for transplantation to the surface of
large burn wounds and ulcers. They can be cultured in artificial media. However, 
the yield is always limited, viability is low, and proliferation and migration
after grafting are slow. The question arose whether tissue fluid/lymph, which is 
a natural humoral environment for epidermal and dermal cells, contains
cytokine(s) specifically regulating KC proliferation and could be used to culture
large numbers of cells for transplantation. Culturing of skin keratinocytes in
dermal tissue fluid/lymph containing keratinocyte growth factor,
interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming
growth factor-beta revealed its strong stimulatory effect on the expression of
p63 stem cell marker and proliferation but not differentiation of KC.
Neutralizing these cytokines with antibodies resulted in decreased percentages of
mitotic figures. None of the individual cytokines showed a dominant effect on
proliferation. This observation suggests that either there may be other (so far
undetected) specific cytokines or that the proliferation and differentiation of
keratinocytes is an effect of the combined action of all investigated cytokines.

The tumor suppressor p53 is commonly mutated in human cancers. However, two
homologs of p53, p63 and p73, are frequently overexpressed in tumors and are
associated with tumor subtypes, clinical outcomes, and responses to therapy.
There are many isoforms of p53, p63 and p73 (the p53 family). Proper detection of
and discrimination between the members of this tumor suppressor family in human
tissues is of critical importance to cancer research and clinical care. In this
study, we assessed the specificity of several commercially available and newly
generated p73 antibodies, focusing on antibodies that distinguish between the TA 
p73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms by western analysis, immunohistochemistry, and
immunofluorescence. In addition, we found that the pan-p63 and pan-p73 antibodies
tested cross-react with p73 and p63 respectively. The results of this study have 
important implications for analysis of p63 and p73 expression and co-expression
in human tumors, and for potential use of these reagents in molecular diagnostics
and therapeutic decision-making.

Recently, the first genome-wide association study of bladder cancer identified an
association of genome-wide significance between single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) rs715021 and urinary bladder cancer risk among European individuals. This
SNP is in a haplotype block in linkage disequilibrium with the TP63 gene. We
investigated the role of this SNP among 1,042 cases and 1,123 controls among
non-Latino whites in Los Angeles County, CA and among Chinese in Shanghai, China.
We confirmed an association between the A allele and bladder cancer risk
[log-additive per A allele odds ratios (OR), 1.24; and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI), 1.02-1.52; P = 0.032] in Los Angeles County and a similar association
in Shanghai (log-additive per A allele OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = 0.080).
These estimates did not differ by study site, smoking status, or gender. However,
the effects were greater in older individuals. Analysis within non-Latino whites,
for whom we had histologic results, revealed that this association was restricted
to low-risk tumors (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.92; P = 0.002) and absent among
high-risk tumors (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80-1.33; P = 0.790; heterogeneity, P =
0.019). A positive association (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.93-2.62; P = 0.089) was only 
observed among high-risk tumors from individuals older than 56 years old
(interaction, P = 0.045). Our results suggest that a TP63 gene variant may
increase susceptibility for the development of urinary bladder tumors with low
risk of progression.

The tumor suppressor p14(ARF) inhibits cell growth in response to oncogenic
stress in a p53-dependent and independent manner. However, new physiologic roles 
for ARF activation have been proposed. We have previously demonstrated that ARF
interacts with p63, influencing its transcriptional activity. p63 is a member of 
the p53 family involved in skin and limb development, as well as in the
homeostasis of mature epidermis. Here, we show that, in human keratinocytes, as
well as in tumor-derived cell lines, ARF targets DeltaNp63alpha, the most
abundantly expressed p63 isoform, to proteasomal degradation by stimulating its
sumoylation. Interestingly, we have observed an increase of ARF expression in
differentiating keratinocytes, that is concomitant to the already described
upregulation of SUMO2/3. Remarkably, we found that DeltaNp63alpha is
preferentially sumoylated by SUMO2, instead of SUMO1, and p14(ARF) increases the 
efficiency of this process.

Oligomerization of members of the p53 family of transcription factors (p53, p63, 
and p73) is essential for their distinct functions in cell-cycle control and
development. To elucidate the molecular basis for tetramer formation of the
various family members, we solved the crystal structure of the human p73
tetramerization domain (residues 351-399). Similarly to the canonical p53
tetramer, p73 forms a tetramer with D(2) symmetry that can be described as a
dimer of dimers. The most striking difference between the p53 and p73
tetramerization domain is the presence of an additional C-terminal helix in p73. 
This helix, which is conserved in p63, is essential for stabilizing the overall
architecture of the tetramer, as evidenced by the different oligomeric structures
observed for a shortened variant lacking this helix. The helices act as clamps,
wrapping around the neighboring dimer and holding it in place. In addition, we
show by mass spectrometry that the tetramerization domains of p63 and p73, but
not p53, fully exchange, with different mixed tetramers present at equilibrium,
albeit at a relatively slow rate. Taken together, these data provide intriguing
insights into the divergent evolution of the oligomerization domain within the
p53 family, from the ancestral p63/p73-like protein toward smaller, less
promiscuous monomeric building blocks in human p53, allowing functional
separation of the p53 pathway from that of its family members.

Ectodermal dysplasias are diseases with abnormal development of ectodermally
derived tissues such as skin, hair, teeth, and nails. Mutations in the
transcription factor p63 have been linked to several syndromes characterized by
ectodermal, orofacial, and limb defects. We present the case of an infant with
ankyloblepharon, cleft palate, scalp dermatitis, and ectrodactyly. She is unique 
for having a novel p63 mutation that has not been previously reported. Her case
also points to the significant overlap between the p63-associated ectodermal
dysplasias and challenges the traditional diagnostic schema for these rare
syndromes.

Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the skin is an unusual neoplasm with
few cases reported in the English medical literature. It has to be differentiated
from adenosquamous carcinoma, usually a high-grade neoplasm with poorer outcome, 
and metastasis from a primary MEC arising elsewhere in the body. We report a
78-year-old woman with an abdominal skin lesion of recent onset.
Histopathological examination revealed a dermal located carcinoma with variable
proportions of squamous differentiation and goblet cells. The patient died in a
very short time for an unrelated disease. Immunohistochemical study showed
staining for cytokeratins (AE1AE3, 7, and 34betaE12), epithelial membrane antigen
(EMA), and p63, whereas cytokeratins 18 and 20 and gross cystic disease fluid
protein (GCDFP15) were negative. We conclude that primary MEC of the skin is
usually a slow-growing neoplasm that should be differentiated from adenosquamous 
carcinoma. The immunohistochemical staining for p63 is helpful to differentiate
primary and metastatic MEC in the skin.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic value of HER2 and p63 expression in head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
STUDY DESIGN: A case review of 186 HNSCCs from the oral tongue, palate, maxillary
sinus, floor of mouth, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All primary tumor specimens were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry for HER2 and p63 expressions, which were correlated with
clinical parameters including age, sex, grade, lymph node metastases, stage, and 
survival.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients had stage III-IV disease and 109 had
lymph node metastases. For all cases, T and N stages were significant prognostic 
predictors for both overall and disease-free survivals. In the node-positive
subgroup, T stage and HER2 expression were significant prognostic predictors for 
both overall and disease-free survivals.
CONCLUSION: HER2 may be associated with longer survival in node-positive patients
with HNSCC.

College, Guangdong, China.

BACKGROUND: ADULT syndrome (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome) is a
rare ectodermal dysplasia disorder known as autosomal dominant inheritance.
Recent studies have linked p63 gene mutation to the development of this disease. 
However, the genetic characteristics of ADULT syndrome were still not well
understood.
METHODS: Mutation analysis of p63 gene in the first Chinese ADULT syndrome family
was performed using direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The sequence analysis of exon 8 of p63 gene disclosed a heterozygous G>A
substitution at nucleotide 893 (R298Q) in the proband. In addition, a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16864880 in the downstream flanking region (DFR) 
of p63 exon 8 was also identified in this family. The proband and the paternal
side including her father exhibited the C/G genotype at this position. The C/G
variant frequency in the paternal was significantly higher as compared with the
maternal (6/10 vs 0/6, P = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: ADULT syndrome may be caused by the p63 gene mutation, and it might 
have closer genetic association with the paternal side in this family.

BACKGROUND: p53 is the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in human
cancers. Unlike other tumour-suppressor genes, most p53 cancer mutations are
missense mutations within the core domain, leading to the expression of a
full-length mutant p53 protein. Accumulating evidence has indicated that p53
cancer mutants not only lose tumour suppression activity but also gain new
oncogenic activities to promote tumourigenesis.
METHODS: The endogenous mutant p53 function in human breast cancer cells was
studied using RNA interference (RNAi). Gene knockdown was confirmed by
quantitative PCR and western blotting. Apoptosis was evaluated by morphological
changes of cells, their PARP cleavage and annexin V staining.
RESULTS: We show that cancer-associated p53 missense mutants are required for the
survival of breast cancer cells. Inhibition of endogenous mutant p53 by RNAi led 
to massive apoptosis in two mutant p53-expressing cell lines, T47D and
MDA-MB-468, but not in the wild-type p53-expressing cells, MCF-7 and MCF-10A.
Reconstitution of an RNAi-insensitive mutant p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells completely
abolished the apoptotic effects after silencing of endogenous mutant p53,
suggesting the specific survival effects of mutant p53. The apoptotic effect
induced by mutant p53 ablation, however, is independent of p63 or p73 function.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide clear evidence of a pro-survival
'gain-of-function' property of a subset of p53 cancer mutants in breast cancer
cells.

PURPOSE: The risk of malignant transformation of oral preneoplastic lesion (OPL) 
is difficult to assess. DeltaNp63 is an early oncoprotein associated with mucosal
tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to assess DeltaNp63 expression in
OPL and its role as a marker of oral cancer risk.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DeltaNp63 expression was determined using
immunohistochemistry in 152 OPL patients included in a clinical trial comparing
retinyl palmitate alone or plus beta-carotene with low-dose 13-cis-retinoic acid.
The associations between DeltaNp63 expression as well as DeltaNp63 expression
with other potential risk factors for oral cancer development were analyzed.
RESULTS: DeltaNp63 expression was positive in 41 (27%) patients, clusters of
intraepithelial inflammatory cells (EIC) were noted in 37 (26%) patients, and
podoplanin (previously reported) was positive in 56 (37%) patients. Significantly
more patients whose lesions were DeltaNp63 positive or exhibited EIC developed
oral cancers. In the multicovariate analysis including age, treatment, and
histologic status as cofactors, positive DeltaNp63 expression was associated with
an increased hazard ratio of 3.308 (95% confidence interval, 1.663-6.580; P =
0.0007). Patients whose lesions showed positive DeltaNp63, podoplanin, and EIC
had the highest oral cancer risk with a hazard ratio of 4.372 (95% confidence
interval, 1.912-9.992; P = 0.0005) and 61% oral cancer development rate at 5
years compared with 15% of other OPL patients (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: DeltaNp63 overepression in OPL is associated with increased oral
cancer risk. Together, DeltaNp63, podoplanin, and EIC may be used as biomarkers
to identify OPL patients with substantially high oral cancer risk.

OBJECTIVES: The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) examined the association between
the relative expression of the DeltaNp63alpha isoform and clinicopathologic
variables, p53 status, angiogenic markers, progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
METHODS: Immunoblot analysis was used to determine the relative expression of
DeltaNp63alpha to beta-actin in lysates of frozen primary tumor from women with
previously untreated, advanced stage EOC who participated in a GOG specimen
banking protocol and a randomized phase III treatment protocol.
RESULTS: DeltaNp63alpha was detected in 49/56 (87.5%) cases with relative
expression ranging from 0 to 4.55 (median=0.325). A correlation was observed
between the relative expression of DeltaNp63alpha and debulking status
(Spearman's correlation coefficient=0.303; p=0.025) and the relative expression
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Spearman's correlation
coefficient=0.303; p=0.045), but not with p53 status (overexpression or
mutation), immunoblot expression of MASPIN, or the relative expression of
thrombospondin-1, basic fibroblast growth factor or VEGF receptor-1. A 1.4-fold
increase was observed in the risk of disease progression for each unit increase
in the relative expression of DeltaNp63alpha using an unadjusted (hazard ratio
[HR]=1.459; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.096-1.942; p=0.010), a full (HR=1.483;
95% CI=1.060-2.076; p=0.021) and a reduced (HR=1.387; 95% CI=1.025-1.877;
p=0.034) Cox regression model. The relative expression of DeltaNp63alpha was not 
associated with OS using an unadjusted, a full or a reduced Cox model.
CONCLUSIONS: The relative expression DeltaNp63alpha appears to be associated with
debulking status and the relative expression of VEGF and PFS, and to be an
independent prognostic factor for disease progression in EOC.

P53 family: at the crossroads in cancer therapy.

p53 and its related genes, p73 and p63, are members of the p53 gene family. While
p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors, p73 and p63 are rarely
mutated or lost in cancers. Although p53-deficient cancer cells are often less
responsive to chemotherapy, they are not completely drug resistant, suggesting
that other apoptotic pathways are at work. Interestingly, several studies have
shown that p73, and more recently p63, are involved in cellular response to
cancer therapy, while others have indicated that p63 and p73 are required for
p53-induced apoptosis, delineating functional interplay between p53 family
members. The latest reports in this field have established that Nutlin-3, a
selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, disrupts p73-MDM2 and enhances p73
function in p53-null cells, and that a p53-derived peptide that targets iASPP--a 
common negative regulator of p53 family members--can trigger cell death via a
p73-dependent mechanism. It has also been shown that a small-molecule RETRA
suppressed mutant p53-bearing cancers cells through a p73-dependent salvage
pathway. Finally, there is increasing evidence that cleaved fragments of p53, p63
and p73 are involved in apoptosis and it remains to be determined whether or not 
pro-forms of the p53 family play an apoptotic role mediated by cleavage. This
review will highlight research into drugs and mechanisms that activate p63 and
p73, since these proteins are not mutated in cancers and as such are potential
candidates for replacing p53 in p53-deficient cells. It will therefore focus on
recent findings in the search for pathways and molecules capable of modulating
p53 family protein activities and restoring response to cancer therapy,
particularly in tumors bearing p53 mutations.

OBJECTIVES: A diagnosis in pulmonary onco-cytopathology primarily necessitates
distinguishing small cell carcinoma (SCLC) from non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC),
which includes squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Lately, p63 antibody
has been used for distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma from SCLC and
adenocarcinoma. We present an analysis of p63 expression in cytological smears
from 100 bronchial lavage specimens comprising 51 cases of SCLC and 49 cases of
NSCLC.
METHODS: A single Papanicolaou-stained conventional smear was de-stained and
re-fixed with cold acetone and methanol for immunocytochemical staining with p63 
antibody. Staining results were graded as 0 (nil), 1+ (focal), 2+ (moderate,
diffuse) and 3+ (strong, diffuse).
RESULTS: Out of 100 cases, 21 were cytologically diagnosed as squamous cell
carcinoma. Twenty of these showed 2+ or 3+ p63 positivity, whereas one, which was
adenocarcinoma on histology, showed 1+ staining. Of seven cases cytologically
diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, six showed no p63 staining, whereas one, which was
squamous cell carcinoma on histology, showed 1+ staining. All 48 cases
cytologically diagnosed as SCLC were confirmed as such on histology and showed no
p63 staining. Four cases were cytologically designated as poorly differentiated
carcinomas, of which three showed no p63 staining and one showed 3+ staining. The
former three were found to be SCLC on histology while the latter was squamous
cell carcinoma. The remaining 20 cases were cytologically designated as NSCLC. Of
these, eight showed no p63 staining, whereas 10 showed 1+ and two showed 2+
staining. The former eight were adenocarcinoma on histology and the latter two
were squamous cell carcinoma. The 10 cases that showed 1+ p63 staining were
adenocarcinomas (n = 5), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4) and NSCLC, not otherwise
specified (n = 1). Positive staining was seen in normal basal cells, which acted 
as an internal control. Overall sensitivity of p63 for squamous cell carcinoma
was 100% and specificity was 90.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 immunostaining on processed cytology smears can be used to help 
identify squamous cell carcinoma. Its diffuse expression was specific for
squamous cell carcinoma while focal staining was also seen in adenocarcinoma.

The transcription factor p63, member of the p53 family, is crucial for epithelial
development. An RNAi screening identified the apoptotic gene Procaspase-8 as a
target activated by p63. The caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP is also under p63 control. 
We analysed and detailed the direct transactivation through the use of RNAi,
reporter assays, ChIPs, western blots, confocal studies in HaCat, as well as in
primary human keratinocytes. The direct DeltaNp63 regulation of these targets was
confirmed in vivo using transgenic DeltaNp63 mice under the K5 promoter, as
compared with p63 knockout mice, and in vitro in normal human primary
keratinocytes following UV irradiation. Lowering the steady state of p63 protein 
levels changes the relative ratio of FLIP isoforms, causing the activation of the
expressed, inactive Procaspase-8, into the active isoform thus triggering the
proapoptotic cascade. Therefore, p63 fine-tunes the Procaspase-8-FLIP pro- and
antiapoptotic pathway in keratinocytes.

Netrins and their receptors deleted in colon cancer (DCC), neogenin, UNC5, and
integrins are involved in axon guidance, epithelial morphogenesis, vascular
pattering, cancer cell survival, invasion, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis.
Here, we considered the possible contribution of the p53-related apoptosis
mediators p63 and p73 in the mechanisms underlying the antagonism between
netrin-1 and DCC at the cell death control. We have showed that ectopic
expression and external addition of netrin-1 in HeLa and HEK-293 cells with
inactive p53 lead to impaired cell viability and induction of apoptosis. These
responses were associated with up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein
TAp73alpha, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and caspase-3 cleavage, with no change in 
protein levels of the antiapoptotic NH(2)-terminal-truncated DeltaNp73alpha
isoform, p73 adapter Yap-1 and p73 E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, and p63, as well as 
the transcripts encoding p63, TAp73alpha, and DeltaNp73alpha. However, the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 potentiated, while DCC counteracted, netrin-1-induced 
TAp73alpha. Consistently, netrin-1 expression correlated with stabilization of
the TAp73alpha protein and lower levels of TAp73alpha ubiquitination that was
conversely enhanced by DCC, in a netrin-dependent manner. Our data indicate that 
netrin-1 selectively up-regulates TAp73alpha by preventing its ubiquitination and
degradation. Targeted repression of p73alpha by shRNA reversed TAp73alpha and the
apoptosis induced by netrin-1, and exacerbated the growth of HeLa tumor
xenografts. Apoptosis induced by cisplatin was markedly enhanced in netrin-1 or
DCC-expressing cells. Collectively, our data reveal that the transcriptionally
active TAp73alpha tumor suppressor is implicated in the apoptosis induced by
netrin-1 in a p53-independent and DCC/ubiquitin-proteasome dependent manner.

The p53 family network is a unique cellular processor that integrates information
from various pathways and determines cellular choices between proliferation,
replication arrest/repair, differentiation, senescence, or apoptosis. The most
studied role of the p53 family is the regulation of stress response and tumor
suppression. By removing damaged cells from the proliferating pool, p53 family
members preserve the integrity of the genome. In addition to this well recognized
role, recent data implicate the p53 protein family in a broader role of
controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Members of the p53
protein family with opposing activity perform coordination of these processes.
Imbalance of p53 protein family may contribute to a significant proportion of
congenital developmental abnormalities in humans.

One of the major handicaps in contemporary clinical oncology is the inability to 
predict the responsiveness of any individual's malignancy to specific therapies. 
The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of immunocytochemically
detecting markers that may be affected by therapy or are predictive of
therapeutic responsiveness, including phosphohistone H1 (anti-p-H1 MoAb 12D11)
and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in small samples obtained via
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy procedure, thus improving therapeutic
monitoring. p63, a squamous stem cell regulatory protein, was also examined.
These three markers were studied in FNA cell block samples of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Twenty-eight alcohol-fixed formalin-postfixed
paraffin-embedded cell-block samples from FNAs of patients with HNSCC were
subjected to antigen retrieval and then incubated with anti-XIAP, anti-p-H1, and 
anti-p63, and developed using EnVision-Plus reagents and diaminobenzidine as
chromagen; Granular or heterogeneous cytoplasmic staining for XIAP and nuclear
staining for p63 and p-H1 were considered positive. Among the 28 cases studied,
the overall positive rates for XIAP, p-H1, and p63 were 60.7%, 96.4%, and 92.8%, 
respectively. The staining intensity for XIAP: + 70.6%, ++ 23.5%, +++ 0%, and
++++ 5.9%; for p-H1: + 48.1%, ++ 11.1%, +++37.0%, and ++++ 3.7%; and for p63: +
11.5%, ++ 23.1%, +++ 53.9%, and ++++ 11.5%. The expression of p-H1 and p63
appeared to be higher and stronger than that of XIAP in HNSCC. This study
demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring expression of three tumor markers
using FNA samples. p-H1 and XIAP may be useful for monitoring actions of
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, XIAP-lowering, and/or apoptosis-inducing
drugs, respectively. Future studies will focus on the impact of therapies upon
these staining profiles.

Mutation of the p53 gene is a common event in human cancer. Interestingly, p53
mutation is uncommon in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The DeltaNp63 has been
postulated to have a dominant-negative effect on the function of the p53 gene and
may play a role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Immortalization 
is a common property of cancer cells and is believed to be an early event in
carcinogenesis. At present, the relationship between DeltaNp63 and
immortalization is poorly understood. In this study, we defined the expression
profile of p63 and its various isoforms in primary and immortalized
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Also, we elucidated some events regulating the
expression of p63. Elevated expression of p63 was generally detected in both
primary and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells at their proliferation
stage and the predominant isoform of p63 expressed was DeltaNp63alpha. p63
expression was suppressed upon cellular senescence of primary nasopharyngeal
epithelial cells and induction of terminal differentiation in immortalized
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Expression of DeltaNp63 alone was able to drive 
clonal proliferation in primary nasopharyngeal cells in culture while
downregulation of DeltaNp63 induced cellular apoptosis. All these results support
a role of DeltaNp63 in proliferation and immortalization which facilitates
pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. TGFbeta and retinoic acid downregulated
the expression of p63 in immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and may
play a role in regulating differentiation in squamous epithelial cells with
potential applications in prevention and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 targets p63 transcription
factor for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and regulates apoptosis.

WWP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase has previously been shown to be frequently amplified and
overexpressed in prostate and breast cancers. However, the mechanism of WWP1
action is still largely unknown. p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription
factors, has an important function in tumor development by regulating apoptosis. 
Using alternative promoters, p63 can be expressed as DeltaNp63 and TAp63.
Increasing evidence suggests that TAp63 sensitizes cells to apoptosis but
DeltaNp63 has an opposite function. In this study, we show that WWP1 binds,
ubiquitinates, and destructs both DeltaNp63alpha and TAp63alpha. The
protein-protein interaction occurs between the PY motif of p63 and the WW domains
of WWP1. The knockdown of WWP1 by siRNA increases the endogenous DeltaNp63alpha
level in the MCF10A and 184B5 immortalized breast epithelial cell lines and
confers resistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, the
knockdown of WWP1 increases the endogenous level of TAp63alpha, induces
apoptosis, and increases sensitivity to doxorubicin and cisplatin in the HCT116
colon cancer cell line in a p53-independent manner. Finally, we found that DNA
damage chemotherapeutic drugs induce WWP1 mRNA and protein expression in a
p53-dependent manner. These data suggest that WWP1 may have a context-dependent
role in regulating cell survival through targeting different p63 proteins for
degradation.

The p53 protein family consists of three transcription factors: p53, p63, and
p73. These proteins share significant structural and functional similarities and 
each has unique biological functions as well. Although the role of p53 in
cellular stress is extensively studied, many questions remain about p63 and p73. 
In this review we summarize current data on functional interactions within the
p53 family, their regulation and roles in response to genotoxic stress. We also
discuss the significance of p73 and p63 for cancer therapy and outline novel
approaches in development of therapeutic drugs that specifically target the p53
family.

Vulvar Paget's disease (VPD) is classified into primary and secondary types.
Differentiation of these subsets in biopsy specimen is important for appropriate 
therapy. Expression profile of cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK20, gross cystic disease 
fluid protein-15 and uroplakin III has been reported as a differentiation marker 
of primary and secondary VPD. To examine the role of p63 immunostaining in
differential diagnosis between primary VPD and VPD secondary to urothelial
carcinoma (VPD-UC), expression of p63 was examined in nine cases of VPD. Paget
cells in seven cases of VPD without UC did not express p63. In two cases of VPD
associated with UC, Paget cells and UC cells had identical CK expression profile.
UC cells were positive for p63 in both cases. In one case, Paget cells were
positive for p63 and examination of the resected specimen showed that VPD was
secondary to UC. In another case, Paget cells were negative for p63 and this was 
diagnosed as primary VPD independent of UC. This indicates that p63 is absent in 
Paget cells in primary VPD and is therefore useful in differentiating primary VPD
from VPD-UC.

We conducted a genome-wide SNP association study on 1,803 urinary bladder cancer 
(UBC) cases and 34,336 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands and follow up
studies in seven additional case-control groups (2,165 cases and 3,800 controls).
The strongest association was observed with allele T of rs9642880 on chromosome
8q24, 30 kb upstream of MYC (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.22; P = 9.34 x
10(-12)). Approximately 20% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous
for rs9642880[T], and their estimated risk of developing UBC is 1.49 times that
of noncarriers. No association was observed between UBC and the four 8q24
variants previously associated with prostate, colorectal and breast cancers, nor 
did rs9642880 associate with any of these three cancers. A weaker signal, but
nonetheless of genome-wide significance, was captured by rs710521[A] located near
TP63 on chromosome 3q28 (allele-specific OR = 1.19; P = 1. 15 x 10(-7)).

BACKGROUND: The pattern of changes in the expression of mammary serine protease
inhibitor (maspin) tumor suppressor protein in tongue epithelial lesions
[hyperplasia (HP), mild dysplasia (MD), moderate-to-severe dysplasia (MSD) and
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)] was investigated and correlated to the expression 
of maspin-regulating factors p53 and p63, and the proliferation marker Ki-67.
METHODS: Cases of HP (n = 16), MD (n = 12), MSD (n = 11), and SCC (n = 22) were
immunostained for maspin, p53, p63, and Ki-67. Maspin expression was scored
separately for the basal, middle, and upper thirds of the epithelial width, and
as the total sum of all 'thirds' (maspin-total). p53, p63, and Ki-67 were
immuno-morphometrically assessed for the entire epithelial width.
RESULTS: Maspin expression was differential and progressive extending to higher
epithelial layers as dysplastic changes aggravated and culminated in carcinoma.
Strong expression was related to MSD in the middle third and to carcinoma in the 
upper third. It was frequently lost at the invasion front, where the tumor was
less differentiated. The changes in mean scores of maspin-total in the different 
study groups were positively correlated to the mean scores of p63 (r = 0.5, P <
0.001), p53 (r = 0.4, P = 0.004), and Ki-67 (r = 0.5, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Strong expression of maspin in the middle third of the epithelium
may be considered a diagnostic sign of mild-to-moderate dysplasia and an
indication of carcinoma in the upper third. The correlations between maspin and
controlling factors (e.g. p63 and p53) may be events with key roles in the
development of tongue carcinoma.

GOLPH2 is coding the 73-kDa type II Golgi membrane antigen GOLPH2/GP73.
Upregulation of GOLPH2 mRNA has been recently reported in expression array
analyses of prostate cancer. As GOLPH2 protein expression in prostate tissues is 
currently unknown, this study aimed at a comprehensive analysis of GOLPH2 protein
in benign and malignant prostate lesions. Immunohistochemically detected GOLPH2
protein expression was compared with the basal cell marker p63 and the prostate
cancer marker alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) in 614 radical prostatectomy 
specimens. GOLPH2 exhibited a perinuclear Golgi-type staining pattern and was
preferentially seen in prostatic gland epithelia. Using a semiquantitative
staining intensity score, GOLPH2 expression was significantly higher in prostate 
cancer glands compared with normal glands (P<0.001). GOLPH2 protein was
upregulated in 567 of 614 tumours (92.3%) and AMACR in 583 of 614 tumours (95%)
(correlation coefficient 0.113, P = 0.005). Importantly, GOLPH2
immunohistochemistry exhibited a lower level of intratumoral heterogeneity (25 vs
45%). Further, GOLPH2 upregulation was detected in 26 of 31 (84%) AMACR-negative 
prostate cancer cases. These data clearly suggest GOLPH2 as an additional
ancillary positive marker for tissue-based diagnosis of prostate cancer.

The p53 family consists of p53, p63, and p73. It has been well characterized that
all of the p53 family proteins are transcription factors and capable of
regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. To determine whether the p53 family exerts
tumor suppression by other mechanisms, we set to identify novel p53 family target
genes. Here, we found that the gene encoding STX6 (syntaxin 6), a vesicle
transporter protein, is directly regulated by each of the p53 family proteins. In
addition, STX6 can be induced by DNA damage and Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in a
p53-dependent manner. To examine how STX6 mediates the activity of the p53
family, STX6 is inducibly overexpressed or knocked down in various cell lines. We
found that overexpression of STX6 alone has limited effect on cell proliferation.
In contrast, we found that knockdown of STX6 inhibits cell proliferation and
survival. We also found that knockdown of STX6 leads to cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that p53 is necessary for STX6
knockdown-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that
STX6 is necessary for proper expression of focal adhesion kinase and integrin
alpha5 adhesion receptor. Consistent with this observation, STX6 knockdown
inhibits cell adhesion. Together, we postulate that STX6 is an effector and a
modulator of the p53 family in the regulation of cell adhesion and survival.

We previously found that the pro-apoptotic DNA damaging agent, cisplatin,
mediated the proteasome-dependent degradation of Delta Np63 alpha associated with
its increased phosphorylated status. Since Delta Np63 alpha usually plays an
opposite role to p53 and TAp63 in human cancers, we tested the notion that
phosphorylation events induced by DNA damage would affect the protein degradation
of Delta Np63 alpha in HNSCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. We found that Delta
Np63 alpha is phosphorylated in the time-dependent fashion at the following
positions: S385, T397 and S466, which were surrounded by recognition motifs for
ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases, respectively. We showed that chemical agents or
siRNA inhibiting the activity of ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases blocked degradation
of Delta Np63 alpha in HNSCC cells after cisplatin exposure. Site-specific
mutagenesis of Delta Np63 alpha residues targeted for phosphorylation by ATM,
CDK2 or p70s6k led to dramatic modulation of Delta Np63 alpha degradation.
Finally, we demonstrated that the Delta Np63 alpha protein is a target for direct
in vitro phosphorylation by ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K. Our results implicate specific
kinases, and target phosphorylation sites in the degradation of Delta Np63 alpha 
following DNA damage.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this report were to describe the 5-year overall survival 
(OS) in a group of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and to
investigate the effects of age, gender, anatomic localization, tumor evolution
time, smoking and alcohol intake, nodal status, tumoral recurrences, histologic
classification, p53 and p63 immunoexpression, human papillomavirus DNA presence, 
and treatment on the prognostic outcome.
STUDY DESIGN: Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier method, and
univariate and multivariate analyses were made using the log rank test and Cox
regression, respectively.
RESULTS: The 5-year OS was 28.6%, and the univariate analysis showed significant 
results for p53 and p63 immunoexpression, age, and anatomic localization. The Cox
regression demonstrated poor OS for tumors with p53 immunoexpression and for
patients aged over 60 years. There were also significant differences in survival 
depending on the anatomic localizations.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight the influence of p53 immunoexpression, age,
and anatomic localization in OSCC evolution.

BACKGROUND: This article sought to investigate the existence of parameters useful
for predicting lymph node metastases in cases of surgically resected oral
squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs).
METHODS: Fifty-eight cases were studied for E-cadherin and the truncated
dominant-negative isoform of p63 (Delta Np63) with immunohistochemistry. In
addition, the p63 gene expression profile was evaluated by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to disclose the presence of the 
truncated variant Delta Np73L.
RESULTS: E-cadherin expression was the most powerful parameter related to the
presence of lymph node metastases at presentation. Twenty-four of 38 (63%) cases 
showing low E-cadherin expression had lymph node metastases at presentation
compared with 5 of 20 (25%) (p <.01) cases showing high E-cadherin expression.
The high predictive value was also maintained when a low expression of E-cadherin
was associated with immunohistochemical high expression of DeltaNp63. The
association between low E-cadherin expression and Delta Np73L (as seen with
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) was highly predictive for
developing lymph node metastases, especially in small tumors (T1\T2). When this
association occurred, metastases developed in 62.5% of cases during the follow-up
compared with 16.1% in those which did not show low E-cadherin expression and
presence of Delta Np73L.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that low E-cadherin expression is useful for
predicting lymph node metastases in cases of OSCC. The predictive value is
enhanced when low E-cadherin positivity is associated with DeltaNp63 and Delta
Np73L expression.

During embryogenesis, the transcription factor Tp63 is expressed in the basal
cells of multiple epithelial tissues. In humans, mutations in TP63 have been
identified in five distinct human developmental disorders that are characterized 
by limb abnormalities, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial anomalies. To dissect the
molecular pathogenesis of the bilateral cleft lip and cleft palate that results
from mutation of Tp63, we analysed Tp63 mutant mice. At E10.5, Tp63-deficient
mice exhibited abnormal morphogenesis of the medial nasal, lateral nasal and
maxillary processes. Analysis of key signaling molecules revealed that these
defects result from increased Bmp4 signaling in the epithelia of the facial
processes. Acting antagonistically on Fgf8 and Shh, this aberrant signaling led
to a reduction in mesenchymal cell proliferation and increased cell death in
specific regions of the facial processes. In addition, a proliferative defect in 
the mesenchyme of the maxillary processes at E11.5 resulted in absence of the
anterior region of the palatal shelves and, subsequently, cleft palate. Our
results are consistent with a role for Tp63 in the regulation of Bmp signaling
controlling the growth, modelling and fusion events underlying facial development
and shed new light on the complex abnormality of facial clefting.

The transcription factor p63 plays a pivotal role in the development and
differentiation of the epidermis and epithelial appendages. Indeed, mutations in 
p63 are associated with a group of ectodermal dysplasias characterized by skin,
limb, and craniofacial defects. It was hypothesized that p63 exerts its functions
by activating specific genes during epidermal development, which in turn regulate
epidermal stratification and differentiation. We have identified I-kappaB kinase 
alpha (IKKalpha) as a direct transcriptional target of p63 that is induced at
early phases of terminal differentiation of primary keratinocytes. We show that
the DeltaNp63 isoform is required for IKKalpha expression in differentiating
keratinocytes and that mutant p63 proteins expressed in ectodermal dysplasia
patients exhibit defects in inducing IKKalpha. Furthermore, we observed reduced
IKKalpha expression in the epidermis of an ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia
clefting patient. Our data demonstrate that a failure to properly express
IKKalpha may play a role in the development of ectodermal dysplasias.

BACKGROUND: The proteins p53, p63 and p73 are known to be overexpressed and to
play important roles in the pathogenesis of many tumours, but the expression of
p63 and p73 has not previously been investigated in extramammary Paget's disease 
(EMPD).
AIM: To investigate the potential contribution of p53, p63 and p73 in the
pathogenesis of EMPD.
METHODS: In total, 35 paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples from patients with
EMPD were examined using immunohistochemical staining for p53, p63 and p73.
RESULTS: All of the 35 EMPD specimens, including all 6 invasive EMPD and 2
metastatic lymph-node specimens, showed nuclear overexpression of both p53 and
p73. The expression levels (percentage of positive cells) of p53 and p73 (90.66
+/- 12.53% and 80.20 +/- 13.07%) in EMPD were significantly higher than those of 
normal skin. There was a significant correlation between the expression levels of
p53 and p73 in EMPD. In 29 of 35 EMPD specimens, there was no nuclear expression 
of p63, and weak or moderate staining was found in only 6 specimens. The
expression level of p63 in EMPD was significantly less than that in normal skin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the concordant overexpression of p53 and p73
and the decreased expression of p63 may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis
of EMPD. The decreased expression of p63 may play a more important role in the
pathogenesis of EMPD than the overexpression of p53 and p73.

p63, known to play a role in development, has more recently also been implicated 
in cancer progression. Mutations in p63 have been shown to be responsible for
several human developmental diseases. Differential splicing of the p63 gene gives
rise to p63 isoforms, which can act either as tumor suppressors or as oncogene.
In this report, we studied the effects of naturally occurring TAp63gamma mutants 
on the regulation of p53/p63 and p63 specific target genes. We observed
significant differences among p63 mutants to regulate the p53/p63 and p63
specific target genes. Additionally, we observed a differential effect of p63
mutants on wildtype-p63-mediated induction of p53/p63 and p63 specific target
genes. We also demonstrated that these mutants differentially regulate the
binding of wildtype p63 to the promoter of target genes. Furthermore, the effects
of these mutants on cell death and survival were consistent with their ability to
regulate the downstream targets when compared to wildtype TAp63gamma. In summary,
our data demonstrate that p63 mutants exhibit differential effects on p63 and
p53/p63 specific target genes and on the induction of apoptosis, and provide
further insight into the function of p63.

The aim of the study was to explore the expression profile of p63, p73 and their 
delta isoforms in the retinoblastoma tumor samples and to correlate with
clinicopathological parameters. Immunohistochemistry was performed for p63, delta
p63, p73 and delta p73 on the archival paraffin sections of retinoblastoma and
correlated with clinicopathological features. Western blotting was performed to
confirm immunoreactivity results. p63 immunoreactivity was observed in 59%
(29/49) of the RB specimens. p63 was expressed in 60% (20/33) low risk tumors and
in 56% (9/16) of high risk tumors. p73 was expressed in 77% (38/49) RB specimens.
Among the 33 low risk tumors, p73 was expressed in 69% (23/33) tumors and among
the 26 high risk tumors, p73 was expressed in 93% (15/16) tumors. High risk
tumors showed significantly increased expression of p73 compared to tumors with
low risk (P<0.05). This is the first correlation between p63/p73 expression and
histopathology in human RB tumors. Our study showed increased expression of p73
in high risk tumors (P<0.05) compared to low risk tumors. Further functional
studies are required to explore the role of p63, p73 and their respective
isoforms in retinoblastoma.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta regulates DeltaNp63 gene transcription through the
beta-catenin signaling pathway.

Overexpression of DeltaNp63 has been observed in a number of human cancers,
suggesting a role for DeltaNp63 in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we show 
that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) by lithium chloride
(LiCl) elicited a stimulatory effect on DeltaNp63 promoter activity in HEK 293T
cells. Exposure to LiCl induced DeltaNp63 promoter activation as well as
DeltaNp63 protein expression in the cells. The effect of GSK-3beta on DeltaNp63
expression was further confirmed by the use of two highly specific GSK-3beta
inhibitors, SB216763 and SB415286. Further study showed the presence of a
putative beta-catenin responsive element (beta-catenin-RE) in the DeltaNp63
promoter region, and the stimulation of DeltaNp63 promoter activity by GSK-3beta 
inhibitor is markedly abolished by mutation or deletion of the putative
beta-catenin-RE. Data are also presented to show that beta-catenin acts together 
with Lef-1 to influence DeltaNp63 promoter activity and protein expression.

Mutations in the p63 gene have been identified in five types of syndromic
ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) with overlapping phenotypes: Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal 
dysplasia-Clefting (EEC syndrome, MIM 604292), Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal
dysplasia-Clefting (AEC syndrome, MIM 106260) [3],
Acro-Dermato-Ungueal-Lacrimal-Tooth (ADULT syndrome, MIM 103285), Rapp-Hodgkin
(RHS syndrome, MIM 129400) and Limb-Mammary (LMS syndrome, MIM 603543) [2]. In
all those conditions congenital heart defects have been only occasionally found
and to date, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVC) has
never been observed in patients affected by p63-related ectodermal dysplasia [9].
Here we describe for the first time this association.

PURPOSE: Compare expression of p63 in pterygium and laryngo-onycho-cutaneous
(LOC) syndrome with normal conjunctiva.
METHODS: P63 immunohistochemical detection was carried out in normal, pterygium, 
and LOC conjunctival tissue. In vitro, growth of normal conjunctival biopsy
specimens, pterygium, and LOC in growth tissue was compared.
RESULTS: In normal conjunctiva, p63 was poorly expressed in the infranasal
quadrant, with 36% of cells stained vs. 55 to 59% in other quadrants (p < 0.05). 
In pterygium, p63 was overexpressed (59% cells stained) compared to normal
supranasal (55%) and normal infranasal conjunctiva (36%, p < 0.05). In LOC, p63
was only expressed in 39% of cells vs. 58% in normal supratemporal conjunctiva (p
< 0.05). Cytokeratin 19 was expressed by all cells cultured from normal
conjunctival tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of using control tissue
explanted from the correspondent conjunctival quadrant when studying
proliferative disorders. Different pathogenesis may account for the differences
in p63 expression between pterygium and LOC.

The p53 homologue DeltaNp63alpha is overexpressed and inhibits apoptosis in a
subset of human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Here, we report that in normal
keratinocytes overexpressing DeltaNp63alpha and in human squamous carcinoma
cells, DeltaNp63alpha physically associates with phosphorylated,
transcriptionally active nuclear c-Rel, a nuclear factor-kappaB family member,
resulting in increased c-Rel nuclear accumulation. This accumulation and the
associated enhanced proliferation driven by elevated DeltaNp63alpha are
attenuated by c-Rel small interfering RNA or overexpression of mutant
IkappaBalphaM, indicating that c-Rel-containing complex formation is critical to 
the ability of elevated DeltaNp63alpha to maintain proliferation in the presence 
of growth arresting signals. Consistent with a role in growth regulation,
DeltaNp63alpha-c-Rel complexes bind a promoter motif and repress the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 in both human squamous carcinoma cells 
and normal keratinocytes overexpressing DeltaNp63alpha. The relationship between 
DeltaNp63alpha and activated c-Rel is reflected in their strong nuclear staining 
in the proliferating compartment of primary head and neck SCC. This is the first 
report indicating that high levels of DeltaNp63alpha interact with activated
c-Rel in keratinocytes and SCC, thereby promoting uncontrolled proliferation, a
key alteration in the pathogenesis of cancers.

Chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CUS) is a recently described condition with
specific immunopathologic findings. Demographics indicate that white women in
their late middle age are more susceptible to this condition. The clinical
history of CUS patients is of painful, exacerbating and remitting oral erosions, 
and ulcerations. The histologic features are non-specific, with a chronic
inflammatory infiltrate, often appearing similar to oral lichen planus (OLP).
Diagnosis of CUS requires surgical biopsy with immunofluorescence microscopic
examination. Accurate diagnosis is important because the usual treatment option
for immunologically mediated diseases, glucocorticoids, is often not effective in
treating CUS. However, hydroxychloroquine pharmacotherapy is beneficial in many
cases. The lack of awareness of the condition among clinicians and the technical 
challenges in specimen processing make diagnosis of CUS a challenge, and hence
the true prevalence is unknown. Immunofluorescence studies show circulating and
tissue-bound autoantibodies to a protein, DeltaNp63alpha, which is a normal
component of stratified epithelia. It is unknown if the antibodies are
pathogenic, thus the etiology of CUS is also unknown. Studies are needed to
elucidate the pathogenesis of CUS, optimize clinical management, and clarify its 
relationship to OLP and neoplasia.

p63 is a transcription factor required for normal epidermal development and
differentiation. Because of the complexity of these processes, p63 is expected to
regulate a myriad of target genes, providing impetus to many laboratories to
identify these genes. p63 target genes have been shown to encode a diverse group 
of proteins, including structural proteins, proteins that control cell cycle
withdrawal, and proteins that regulate the epidermal differentiation program. In 
this issue, Antonini et al., describe a novel p63 target gene whose evolutionary 
conservation suggests a critical role for this gene in the epidermis.

Split-Hand/Foot Malformation (SHFM) is a complex limb malformation affecting the 
central rays of the autopod. We studied a large consanguineous kindred afflicted 
with autosomal recessive SHFM. Twelve affected members had central feet
reductions with or without hand involvement while the remaining one had the
mildest phenotype and atypical SHFM. We identified by homozygosity mapping a
novel SHFM locus at 12q13.11-q13 with a maximum multipoint lod score of 5.47 and 
by subsequent candidate gene approach a homozygous missense WNT10b mutation
(p.R332W) in all affected individuals but the atypical case plus in an
asymptomatic female. We propose that either a second locus contributes to the
manifestation of SHFM phenotype or a suppressor locus prevented trait
manifestation in the non-penetrant female. We also investigated linkage to the
five known SHFM loci. Four of the loci were excluded, while in TP63 [tumor
protein p63 (SHFM4)], the only known gene responsible for SHFM, we detected in
most affected subjects a rare insertion variant (rs34201045) at the alternate
promoter used for transcription of the N-terminal-truncated p63 isotype. This is 
the first reported WNT10b mutation on the pathogenesis of limb development and
recessive mutation in SHFM.

The epidermis, the outer layer of the skin composed of keratinocytes, is a
stratified epithelium that functions as a barrier to protect the organism from
dehydration and external insults. The epidermis develops depending on the
transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors.
p63 is strongly expressed in the innermost basal layer where epithelial cells
with high clonogenic and proliferative capacity reside. Deletion of p63 in mice
results in a dramatic loss of all keratinocytes and loss of stratified epithelia,
probably due to a premature proliferative rundown of the stem and transient
amplifying cells. Here we report that microRNA (miR)-203 is induced in vitro in
primary keratinocytes in parallel with differentiation. We found that miR-203
specifically targets human and mouse p63 3'-UTRs and not SOCS-3, despite
bioinformatics alignment between miR-203 and SOCS-3 3'-UTR. We also show that
miR-203 overexpression in proliferating keratinocytes is not sufficient to induce
full epidermal differentiation in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate that miR-203
is downregulated during the epithelial commitment of embryonic stem cells, and
that overexpression of miR-203 in rapidly proliferating human primary
keratinocytes significantly reduces their clonogenic capacity. The results
suggest that miR-203, by regulating the DeltaNp63 expression level, is a key
molecule controlling the p63-dependent proliferative potential of epithelial
precursor cells both during keratinocyte differentiation and in epithelial
development. In addition, we have shown that miR-203 can regulate DeltaNp63
levels upon genotoxic damage in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells, thus
controlling cell survival.

DeltaNp63alpha, the dominant negative isoform of the p63 family is an essential
survival factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This isoform has been
shown to be down regulated in response to several DNA damaging agents, including 
cisplatin. But little is understood about the post-translational protein
stability of DeltaNp63alpha. In this present study we demonstrate for the first
time that DeltaNp63alpha physically interacts with U-box-type E4 ubiquitin ligase
UFD2a. UFD2a stabilizes DeltaNp63alpha, and ubiquitylation of DeltaNp63alpha is
attenuated by UFD2a both in the presence and absence of cisplatin. Ectopic
expression of UFD2a increased the half-life of DeltaNp63alpha in association with
a significant enhancement of the repressive transcriptional activity of
DeltaNp63alpha. Downregulation of endogenous UFD2a by RNAi resulted in
degradation of DeltaNp63alpha. Taken together, our current study provides an
insight onto the regulation of DeltaNp63alpha protein levels in response to
cisplatin and also suggests that UFD2a might play an important role in the
regulation of cisplatin mediated cell death mediated by p63.

Therapeutic replacement of the wild-type p53 gene has been pursued as a potential
gene therapy strategy in a variety of cancer types; however, some cancer models
are resistant to p53 in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, to improve p53 gene
therapy, it is important to overcome the resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors are a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents that 
are able to reverse the malignant phenotype of transformed cells. A natural
histone deacetylase inhibitor, FK228, is reported to enhance adenovirus infection
due in part to the up-regulation of coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor
expression. In this study, preclinical experiments were done to establish a
mechanistic rationale for the combination of adenovirus-mediated p53 family gene 
transfer and FK228 pretreatment in future clinical trials. Pretreatment with
FK228 enhanced apoptosis in human cancer cells through enhanced transduction of
Ad-p53. FK228 also induced hyperacetylation of the p53 protein and specifically
enhanced p53-mediated Noxa expression. Additionally, the combination of FK228 and
Ad-p53 induced Bax translocation to the mitochondria. The double knockdown of Bax
and Noxa expression by small interfering RNA antagonized the synergistic effect
of Ad-p53 and FK228 on apoptosis induction. In human cancer xenograft models,
FK228 significantly increased the therapeutic effectiveness of p53 as well as p63
gene therapy. These results provide a strong rationale for combining p53 gene
therapy and FK228 pretreatment in cancer therapy.

Degradation of HPV20E6 by p53: Delta Np63 alpha and mutant p53R248W protect the

The E6 and E7 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPV) play a crucial role in the
pathogenesis of malignant tumors. E6 protein of high-risk mucosal
papillomaviruses targets a number of proteins for proteosomal degradation through
complex formation with ubiquitin ligase E6AP. These proteins include, amongst
others, p53, paxillin and PDZ-domain proteins e.g. Dlg and MAGUK. The mechanism
by which the E6 protein of cutaneous HPV types interacts with cellular proteins
to induce either benign or malignant cutaneous lesions, has not been elucidated, 
although extensive ultraviolet exposure and mutated p53 (hot-spot mutations) are 
known to be associated with non-melanoma skin cancer. We demonstrate two
mechanisms in which HPV20E6 may be involved in the infected cell. One pathway is 
the wtp53 mediated degradation of HPV20E6 through caspase-3. Mutated p53R248W and
Delta Np63 alpha, as well as other unknown proteins involved in
proteosome-dependent degradation, convey a protective effect on HPV20E6 under
these conditions. This unveils a remarkable opposite regulation to the well-known
mechanism of E6-E6AP mediated degradation of p53 for mucosal HPV types. In a
second interaction, ectopically expressed HPV20E6 induces cleavage of
procaspase-3 to active caspase-3. We demonstrate, in addition, in vivo binding of
HPV20E6 to the intermediate filament vimentin.

Post-translational modification of the p53 family members is key to their
regulation. Here we report the phosphorylation of TAp63gamma, but not
DeltaNp63gamma, by IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta). Activation of IKKbeta by gamma 
radiation or tumor necrosis factor-alpha led to increased TAp63gamma protein
levels in cells. IKKbeta, but not its kinase-defective mutant IKKbeta-K44A, led
to this observed stabilization of TAp63gamma. This stabilization of TAp63gamma in
response to gamma radiation was significantly decreased in the absence of
IKKbeta. Phosphorylation of TAp63gamma blocks ubiquitylation and possible
degradation of this protein. We postulate that phosphorylation of TAp63gamma by
IKKbeta stabilizes the TAp63gamma protein by blocking ubiquitylation-dependent
degradation of this protein.

p73, a member of the p53 family, exhibits activities similar to those of p53,
including the ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. p73 influences
chemotherapeutic responses in human cancer patients, in association with p53.
Alternative splicing of the TP73 gene produces many p73 C- and N-terminal
isoforms, which vary in their transcriptional activity towards p53-responsive
promoters. In this paper, we show that the C-terminal spliced isoforms of the p73
protein differ in their DNA-binding capacity, but this is not an accurate
predictor of transcriptional activity. In different p53-null cell lines, p73beta 
induces either mitochondrial-associated or death receptor-mediated apoptosis, and
these differences are reflected in different gene expression profiles. In
addition, p73 induces cell cycle arrest and p21(WAF1) expression in H1299 cells, 
but not in Saos-2. This data shows that TAp73 isoforms act differently depending 
on the tumour cell background, and have important implications for p73-mediated
therapeutic responses in individual human cancer patients.

Tumor suppressor TP53 gene is one of the most mutated genes in human genome.
Inactivating somatic mutations and disruption of p53 protein have been described 
in almost all human malignancies. Its inactivation by germline mutation leads to 
the rare but severe familial precancerosis termed Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This
syndrome is characterized by the early onset of different types of cancers
including soft-tissue sarcomas, breast and brain cancers, leukemias, lung,
laryngeal cancers, and adrenocortical carcinomas. The key role of p53 in tumor
suppression has been confirmed in animal models as well. The p53 -knock-out and
knock-in animals were born alive but were tumor prone. In the late nineties, two 
genes with high homology with TP53 were discovered, TP73 and TP63, respectively. 
Animal models showed that p73 is an important player in neurogenesis, sensory
pathways and homeostatic control. The p63 is critical for the development of
stratified epithelial tissues such as epidermis, breast, and prostate. Despite
the structural similarities with p53, the function of these proteins in
tumorigenesis is controversial. On one hand, there are evidences that both, p63
and p73-deficient animals are not tumor prone; on the other hand, there is
evidence that such animals develop tumors later during their life. Unlike in TP53
gene, mutations in TP63 and TP73 genes are rare, however, germline mutations in
TP63 are linked to the human developmental diseases. In this minireview, we
describe the contribution of the p53, p63, and p73 to human pathology with
emphasis on their different roles in development and tumorigenesis.

p63 is expressed as multiple variants including TA and DeltaN forms. Since
p63-deficient mice displayed profound defects of stratified epithelia, p63 is an 
essential transcription factor required for epidermal morphogenesis. However,
precise molecular mechanisms behind contribution of p63 to normal skin formation 
and healing skin wounds remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that
DeltaNp63/BMP-7 signaling pathway modulates wound healing process through the
regulation of extracellular matrix protein matrilin-2. Knocking down of DeltaNp63
in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells led to a significant reduction of matrilin-2.
Intriguingly, BMP-7 which is one of DeltaNp63-target gene products, induced
matrilin-2 and attenuated inhibitory effect of siRNA against DeltaNp63 on
matrilin-2. Furthermore, a remarkable cell migration in response to wounding took
place in DeltaNp63- or matrilin-2-knocked down cells. Taken together, our present
findings indicate that DeltaNp63/BMP-7 signaling pathway modulates wound healing 
process through the regulation of matrilin-2.

Previous reports have suggested that specific isoforms of the potential stem cell
marker p63 may regulate corneal epithelial homeostatic renewal through control of
cell proliferation. In this study, we characterized the presence of DeltaNp63
isoforms in telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (hTCEpi) in
comparison to normal human corneal epithelium to validate the hTCEpi cell line as
a viable model for the study of p63 isoforms. We further examined roles for
DeltaNp63 in proliferation and differentiation. For in vitro studies, hTCEpi
cells were cultured in serum-free culture media and grown under 0.15 mM calcium
or sequential 1.15 mM calcium/air-lifted culture. Fresh donor human corneal
tissue was used to assess expression and localization in situ. mRNA and protein
levels were assessed by real-time PCR, Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western
blotting (WB). DeltaNp63 expression levels throughout the cell cycle were
assessed by double-labeling with DeltaNp63 and Ki-67. In situ, DeltaNp63
localized to nuclei throughout the human corneal epithelium and was lost only in 
superficial cells. WB confirmed the presence of all three DeltaNp63 isoforms in
the central corneal epithelium and in hTCEpi cells. DeltaNp63 mRNA levels
decreased when grown on collagen substrate and under increased calcium/air-lifted
culture. mRNA and protein levels increased as cells approached confluence, with a
significant decrease in post-confluent culture. DeltaNp63 expression levels did
not vary with the cell cycle, as assessed by Ki-67 labeling. Collectively, the
presence of all three DeltaNp63 isoforms in hTCEpi cells and in intact cornea
validates the use of this cell line for the study of individual isoforms in the
corneal epithelium; and these data suggest that expression of DeltaNp63 isoforms 
are not altered as a function of the cell cycle or cell division in subconfluent 
hTCEpi cells cultured in serum-free media, but demonstrate reduced expression
upon contact-inhibited growth down-regulation and differentiation. Significantly,
the localization of DeltaNp63 in central corneal epithelial cells with a loss of 
expression in superficial cells suggests that DeltaNp63 may play a role in
mediating desquamative events at the ocular surface.

TP63 is required for preservation of epithelial regenerative stasis and regulates
the activity of diverse genetic pathways; however, specific effector pathways are
poorly understood. Data presented here indicate that reciprocal regulatory
interactions between hedgehog signaling and TP63 mediate stage-specific effects
on proliferation and clonigenicity of separable enriched mammary stem and
progenitor fractions. Analysis of DeltaN-p63 and TA-p63 indicates segregated
expression in mammary stem and progenitor fractions, respectively, demonstrating 
that differential TP63 promoter selection occurs during elaboration of mammary
progenitors by mammary stem cells. This segregation underlies mammary
progenitor-specific expression of Indian Hedgehog, identifying it as a binary
transcriptional target of TP63. Hedgehog activation in vivo enhances elaboration 
of mammary progenitors and decreases label retention within mammary stem
cell-enriched fractions, suggesting that hedgehog exerts a mitogenic effect on
mammary stem cells. Hedgehog signaling promotes differential TP63 promoter usage 
via disruption of Gli3 or Gli3(R) accumulation, and shRNA-mediated disruption of 
Gli3 expression was sufficient to alter TP63 promoter usage and enhance
clonigenicity of mammary stem cells. Finally, hedgehog signaling is enhanced
during pregnancy, where it contributes to expansion of the mammary progenitor
compartment. These studies support a model in which hedgehog activates
elaboration and differentiation of mammary progenitors via differential TP63
promoter selection and forfeiture of self-renewing capacity.

p63, p73 and p53 are transcription factors members of the p53 gene family
involved in development, differentiation and cell response to stress. p53 gene is
mutated in 50% of human cancer. Moreover, when p53 gene is not mutated then its
tumour suppressor pathway is lost through interaction with abnormally expressed
cellular protein or viral protein. Therefore p53 pathway inactivation is a common
denominator to cancer. However, it is still difficult to associate in the clinic 
p53 status to cancer prognosis and diagnosis. Recent publications may have a
profound impact on our understanding of p53 tumour suppressor activity. p63, p73 
and p53 genes have a dual gene structure conserved in drosophila, zebrafish and
man. They encode for multiple p63, p73 or p53 proteins containing different
protein domains (isoforms) due to multiple splicing, alternative promoter and
alternative initiation of translation. The interplay between p53, p63 and p73
isoforms are likely to be fundamental to our understanding of tumour formation.

ASPP1 and ASPP2 are activators of p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas iASPP is an
inhibitor of p53. Binding assays showed differential binding for C-terminal
domains of iASPP and ASPP2 to the core domains of p53 family members p53, p63,
and p73. We also determined a high-resolution crystal structure for the C
terminus of iASPP, comprised of four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain. The
crystal lattice revealed an interaction between eight sequential residues in one 
iASPP molecule and the p53-binding site of a neighboring molecule. ITC confirmed 
that a peptide corresponding to the crystallographic interaction shows specific
binding to iASPP. The contributions of ankyrin repeat residues, in addition to
those of the SH3 domain, generate distinctive architecture at the p53-binding
site suitable for inhibition by small molecules. These results suggest that the
binding properties of iASPP render it a target for antitumor therapeutics and
provide a peptide-based template for compound design.

AIM: To investigate the immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, p53 and p63 in
Keratocyst Odontogenic Tumours (KOTs) in order to contribute to the biological
profile of this tumor.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical technique was performed using the EnVision System in
37 cases of KOTs.
RESULTS: Ki-67- and p53-immunostained cells were mainly located in the suprabasal
layers. p63-positive cells were found throughout the lining cystic epithelium. No
difference in the immunostaining for these proteins was observed between primary 
and recurrent KOTs (Ki-67: P = 0.5591; p53: P = 0.9847; p63: P = 0.9127), or
between KOTs associated with Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS) and
sporadic KOTs (Ki-67: P = 0.7013; p53: P = 0.3197; p63: P = 0.2427).
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that biological behavior of KOTs may be related to
suprabasal proliferative compartment in the cystic epithelium as observed by high
levels of Ki-67, p53 and p63. In addition, p63 immunostaining may represent
immaturity of keratinocytes in KOTs, and suggests that this protein may
participate in the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation. Taken together,
these data may favor tumorigenesis on KOTs.

p63 and p73 are highly homologous members of the p53 family that originated by
gene duplication at the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition. We characterize
here a previously unreported gene, Transformation-related protein 63 regulated
(Tprg), located upstream of the p63 gene in the vertebrate genome, with striking 
similarity to Transformation related protein 63 regulated like (Tprgl), an
uncharacterized gene located upstream of p73, suggesting that p63/Tprg and
p73/Tprgl are embedded in a paralogue region originated from a single duplication
event. Tprg is predominantly expressed in the epithelial compartment of the skin,
more abundantly in differentiated cells. Consistent with its relative higher
expression in differentiated keratinocytes, finely tuned p63 expression levels
are required for optimal Tprg expression in primary keratinocytes. p63 is
essential for Tprg expression as shown in p63-knockdown keratinocytes; however,
high levels of p63 result in Tprg downregulation. p63 directly binds in vivo to a
canonical p63-binding site in an evolutionary conserved genomic region located in
Tprg intron 4. This genomic region is sufficient to function as a p63-inducible
enhancer in promoter studies. Thus, we demonstrate that the Tprg gene is
predominantly expressed in skin, is physically associated with the p63 gene
during evolution, and directly regulated by p63 through a long-distance enhancer 
located within the Tprg locus.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of GLUT1, p63 and DNA-Pkcs in serous
ovarian tumors and their significance.
METHODS: GTUL1, p63 and DNA-Pkcs expression at protein level was detected by
immunohistochemistry in patients with serous ovarian tumors. Chi-square analysis 
was used to assess if their expression is associated with clinicopathologic
characteristics of the tumors.
RESULTS: Cells in the normal ovarian tissues were not stained with GTUL1 and p63 
antiserum, but DNA-Pkcs was positively stained. The intensity of GTUT1 and p63
expression was stronger in malignant ovarian serous tumors compared with other
subtypes (P < 0.01). There were significant differences of DNA-PKcs among normal 
ovaries (100.0%), benign (95.0%), borderline (90.0%) and malignant (60.0%)
serious ovarian neoplasms (P < 0.01). The level of GLUT-1 expression was
correlated with FIGO staging, intraperitoneal implantation, ascites and lymph
node metastasis (P < 0.05). p63 expression was associated with clinicopathologic 
characteristics except ascites (P < 0.05). DNA-PKcs was only correlated with FIGO
staging and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the abnormal expression of GTUT1, p63 and
DNA-Pkcs may perhaps participate in serous ovarian tumor occurrence and
development and may be considered as a marker reflecting tumor malignant
behavior.

P-cadherin is a member of the classical cadherin family that forms the
transmembrane core of adherens junctions. Recently, mutations in the P-cadherin
gene (CDH3) have been shown to cause two inherited diseases in humans:
hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia,
ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome). The common features of both
diseases are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina, while only EEM
syndrome shows the additional finding of split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). We 
identified five consanguineous Pakistani families with either HJMD or EEM
syndrome, and detected pathogenic mutations in the CDH3 gene of all five
families. In order to define the role of P-cadherin in hair follicle and limb
development, we performed expression studies on P-cadherin in the mouse embryo,
and demonstrated the predominant expression of P-cadherin not only in the hair
follicle placode, but also at the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud. 
Based on the evidence that mutations in the p63 gene also result in hypotrichosis
and SHFM, and that the expression patterns of p63 and P-cadherin overlap in the
hair follicle placode and AER, we postulated that CDH3 could be a direct
transcriptional target gene of p63. We performed promoter assays and ChIP, which 
revealed that p63 directly interacts with two distinct regions of the CDH3
promoter. We conclude that P-cadherin is a newly defined transcriptional target
gene of p63, with a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the
AER during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in
mice.

The N terminus-truncated splicing variant of TAp63 is known as DeltaNp63.
DeltaNp63 lacks transactivation function and is thought to antagonize the
transcriptional regulation of the p53 and TAp63 target genes. Overexpression of
DeltaNp63 has been observed in a number of human cancers, suggesting a role in
carcinogenesis. In the present study we present data showing that the DeltaNp63
gene promoter activity is positively regulated by DeltaNp63alpha, and such
positive autoregulation is mediated via activation of STAT3 activity. We show
that expression of DeltaNp63alpha in Hep3B cells induces Stat3 phosphorylation on
Tyr-705 and Ser-727. A putative STAT3-responsive element (STAT3-RE) is identified
in the DeltaNp63 promoter region. Electrophoretic mobility shift and avidin
biotin-Conjugated DNA assays show direct binding of STAT3 to STAT3-RE of the
DeltaNp63 promoter, and such binding is stimulated by DeltaNp63alpha. Binding of 
the endogenous STAT3 to the DeltaNp63 promoter in Hep3B cells was demonstrated by
a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The stimulation of the DeltaNp63
transcriptional activity by DeltaNp63alpha is abolished by Janus kinase 2
(JAK2)/STAT3 inhibitor AG490, dominant-negative STAT3, STAT3 small interfering
RNA, and deletion of the STAT3-RE sequence from DeltaNp63 promoter. Taken
together these observations clearly indicated that autoregulation of DeltaNp63
gene transcription is mediated through activation of STAT3 and its subsequent
binding to the STAT3RE. Because the activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 also
leads to DeltaNp63 up-regulation and the blockade of DeltaNp63 or STAT3
expression by siRNA leads to repression of the cell growth, the identified
regulatory pathway is presumably of cell physiological significance.

The transcription factor p63 is commonly over-expressed in squamous cell
carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). By microarray analysis of
p63-siRNA-treated SCCHN cells we identified 127 genes whose expression relies on 
over-expression of p63. More than 20% of these genes are involved in cell
motility. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assay revealed PAI-1 and
AQP3 as direct p63 transcriptional targets. In addition to PAI-1, most of the key
cell motility-related molecules are up-regulated by p63, such as MMP14 and
LGALS1. Our findings indicate a contribution by p63 in cell invasion and
migration, supporting an oncogenic role for p63 in SCCHN.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the morbidity and pathological features of incidental
prostate cancer and their clinical significance.
METHODS: 1483 prostate specimens obtained during operation, including
transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and total resection of the prostate,
for the diagnoses of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) or bladder cancer between
January 1999 and August 2005 underwent pathological examination and 34beta12 and 
p63 immunohistochemical staining so as to detect incidental prostate cancer. The 
volume of incidental prostate cancer was calculated by the image analysis system.
The clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. Comparison between the clinical 
and pathological feature of incidental prostate cancer was made.
RESULTS: 53 cases of incidental prostate cancer, with the Gleason scores from 2
(1+1) to 9 (4+5) and the volumes from 0.18 to 1440.00 mm(3) were detected. The
morbidity of incidental prostate cancer was 3.6%. The volume of 47 cases (88.7%) 
were less than 0.5 cm(3) as the threshold of insignificant cancer, and the
volumes of 6 cases (11.3%) were more than 0.5 cm(3). All incidental prostate
cancers of clinical significance were detected in the TURP samples. Among the
incidental prostate cancers found in the TURP samples 20% were clinically
significant cancers. The clinically significant incidental cancers were located
in the central or transitional zone with the Gleason scores of 3 + 4 (2 cases), 4
+ 2 (1 case), or 4 + 5 (3 cases). These clinically significant cancers were of
diffuse distribution, and their preoperative clinical features were negative in
palpation/image examination, elevation of serum PSA, and negative in puncture
examination.
CONCLUSION: Nowadays, the morbidity of incidental prostate cancer is lower than
that of 1980s'. Among the incidental cancers 11.3% were of clinical significance.
That the preoperative clinical examination cannot find these clinical significant
cancers is partially caused by the pathological features of these tumors.

Female fertility in mammals is determined by the pool of primordial follicles and
low doses of radiation induce a major loss of primordial follicles in the ovary. 
We investigated the expression of p53 and its homologues, p63 and p73, in the
normal and irradiated neonatal ovary. p63 was the only member of the p53 family
detected in oocyte nucleus. No p63 transcripts or protein were detected in the
early foetal ovary. p63 production began in late pachytene-stage oocytes and
peaked in diplotene oocytes in mice and humans. The production of p63 was
correlated with meiotic DNA double-strand break repair. Only transactivation (TA)
isoforms were present in the ovary, with TAp63 alpha by far the most abundant in 
terms of mRNA and protein levels. Complete p63 null mutation did not affect
normal ovary development. Irradiation rapidly triggered p63 phosphorylation. p63 
null mutation prevented the cleavage of caspases-9 and -3 and the follicle loss
induced by ionising radiation. Thus, our results evidence that
irradiation-induced depletion of the primordial follicle pool results from the
activation of p63 in quiescent oocytes.

p63, a member of the p53 family, is overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma of
the head and neck (SCCHN) and some other tumors of epithelial origin. As a
transcription factor, p63 can bind to p53-type response elements and there is
some overlap between p53 family transcriptional targets. Tumor necrosis factor
receptor associated factor 4 (TRAF4) is a p53 regulated gene which is
overexpressed in many human carcinomas. We investigated the involvement of p63 in
regulation of TRAF4 and the expression of the TRAF4 protein in SCCHN. Disrupting 
endogenous p63 expression resulted in downregulation of TRAF4 mRNA and protein in
an SCCHN cell line. Endogenous p63 bound to the TRAF4 promoter in vivo and
reporter assays showed that p63, p73 and p53 can all transactivate TRAF4, with
TAp63 isoforms being the most potent activators. The level of TRAF4 activation by
TAp63 was two-fold higher than by p53, and TRAF4 was ten-fold more responsive to 
TAp63 than another p63-target, IGFBP3. Nuclear expression of TRAF4 was seen in
normal oral epithelium and highly/moderately differentiated SCCHN, whereas
cytoplasmic expression of TRAF4 was seen in poorly differentiated SCCHN. These
results indicate that TRAF4 is a common target of p53 family members and that
localization of TRAF4 is associated with differentiation of SCCHN cells.

Betel-quid chewing, which is closely related to the high incidence of oral
cancer, is prevalent in Sri Lanka. p63 has a remarkable structural similarity to 
p53, suggesting an aberrant expression in oral cancer. Using anti-p63 antibody
and immunohistochemistry, the present study investigated the expression pattern
of p63 in oral epithelial lesions, including different types of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), different grades of epithelial dysplasia, and submucosal
fibrosis associated with betel-quid chewing. Nuclear immunoreactivity for p63 was
detected in all the cases, including normal oral epithelium and epithelial
lesions. In normal oral epithelium, nuclear positivity for p63 was observed in
some of the basal cell layers and focally in the parabasal layer. Nuclear
positivity increased in the epithelial lesions. The percentage of positive nuclei
in the epithelial lesions was significantly higher than in normal epithelium (P <
0.01) and was also significantly higher in oral submucosal fibrosis than in
epithelial dysplasia (P < 0.05). The results indicate that the overexpression of 
p63 in oral precancerous lesions and SCC in betel-quid chewers in Sri Lanka may
be a useful marker for oral precancerous lesions.

TP63, a member of the TP53 gene family, encodes two groups of three isoforms
(alpha, beta and gamma). The TAp63 isoforms act as transcription factors. The
DeltaNp63 isoforms lack the main transcription activation domain and act as
dominant-negative inhibitors of transactivation (TA) isoforms. To clarify the
role of these isoforms and to better understand their functional overlap with
p53, we ectopically expressed each p63 isoform in the p53-null hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line Hep3B. All TA isoforms, as well as DeltaNp63alpha, had a
half-life of <1 h when transiently expressed and were degraded by the proteasome 
pathway. The most stable form was DeltaNp63gamma, with a half-life of >8 h. As
expected, TA isoforms differed in their transcriptional activities toward genes
regulated by p53, TAp63gamma being the most active form. In contrast, DeltaNp63
isoforms were transcriptionally inactive on genes studied and inhibited TA
isoforms in a dose-dependent manner. When stably expressed in polyclonal cell
populations, TAp63beta and gamma isoforms were undetectable. However, when
treated with doxorubicin (DOX), p63 proteins rapidly accumulated in the cells.
This stabilization was associated with an increase in phosphorylation.
Strikingly, in DOX-treated polyclonal populations, increase in TAp63 levels was
accompanied by overexpression of DeltaNp73. This observation suggests complex
regulatory cross talks between the different isoforms of the p53 family. In
conclusion, p63 exhibits several transcriptional and stress-response properties
similar to those of p53, suggesting that p63 activities should be taken into
consideration in approaches to improve cancer therapies based on genotoxic
agents.

p63 shares considerable sequence identity with p53, especially in its
DNA-binding, activation and tetramerization domains. When the upstream promoter
is used for p63 expression, three major transactivation p63 (TAp63) isoforms
(alpha, beta and gamma) are produced. p63 is also expressed from an alternate
promoter located in intron 3, producing three major DeltaNp63 isoforms. Recent
studies demonstrated that p63 has the potential to function as a tumor suppressor
or an oncoprotein. To further address this, we generated cell lines that
inducibly express each TAp63 isoform. We showed that TAp63 isoforms are capable
of inducing p53-responsive genes, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting
apoptosis. Interestingly, we discovered that both the activation domain (residues
1-59) and the proline-rich domain (residues 67-127) are required for TAp63
transcriptional activity. Likewise, TAp63beta(DeltaPRD), deleted of residues
60-133, possessed a greatly attenuated ability to induce endogenous target genes 
and promote apoptosis, but retained the ability to inhibit cell proliferation
when expressed in stable, inducible cell lines. TAp63beta(DeltaPRD) also
functioned as a dominant negative to wild-type p63beta in a dose-dependent
manner. Furthermore, the loss of function seen with deletion of the proline-rich 
domain was not due to a DNA-binding defect, as TAp63beta(DeltaPRD) was found to
strongly bind endogenous promoters using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
Finally, mutational analysis revealed that a PXXP motif at residues 124-127
contributes to the transcriptional activity of TAp63. Altogether, our findings
suggest that TAp63 transcriptional activity can be regulated by modification(s)
of, or protein interactions with, the p63 proline-rich domain.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells represent a unique cellular model to recapitulate in
vitro early steps of embryonic development and an unlimited cellular source in
therapy for many diseases, as well as targets for drug discovery and toxicology
screens. Although previous studies have reported epidermal differentiation of
mouse and human embryonic stem (huES) cells, the heterogeneity of the resulting
cell culture impairs the evaluation of differentiated cells for cell therapy. We 
report here the reproducible isolation of a homogenous ectodermal cell
population, IT1, from human ES cells. Like primary cells, IT1 cells remain
homogenous over 15 passages, expand up to 60 population doublings, and then die
through senescence. Accordingly, IT1 cells display a normal karyotype and a
somatic cell cycle kinetics and do not produce teratoma in nude mice. The
production of K14-expressing epithelial cells driven by p63 expression
strengthens the ectodermal nature of IT1 cells. Since IT1 can be isolated from
different huES cell lines, it may provide a ready source of ectodermal
progenitors for the development of a toxicology cell model, new-drug-screening
strategies, and cell therapy transplantation.

DeltaNp63alpha is exclusively expressed in stem cells and progenitor cells of the
stratified epithelia. It promotes cell proliferation by antagonizing p53 and
related TAp63/TAp73. Here, we report that specific desumoylation by SUMO protease
SuPr-1 provides a fine-tuning mechanism for DeltaNp63alpha repressor activity. We
found that disrupting the sumoylation site compromised DeltaNp63alpha repressor
activity profoundly against TAp63gamma and TAp73beta-mediated transcription
activation, but not to p53-mediated transcription. We further found that SuPr-1
specifically bound to sumoylated DeltaNp63alpha and hydrolyzed SUMO.
Consequently, SuPr-1 expression reduced DeltaNp63alpha repressor activity to
TAp63gamma and TAp73beta, whereas p53-mediated transactivation was unaffected.
Collectively, these data suggest that SuPr-1-mediated DeltaNp63alpha
desumoylation elaborately regulates epithelial growth.

BACKGROUND: P63 belongs to the 'p53 family' whose role in cancer progression has 
been recently revisited in light of the plethora of splicing variants that are
generated. We analyzed the expression of the full-length TAp63 gene and its
dominant-negative form deltaNp63 in ovarian cancer biopsies to correlate their
expression with clinical outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time RT-PCR analysis was used to determine the levels
of TAp63 and deltaNp63 in 83 stage I and in 86 stage III ovarian cancer biopsies 
and in seven human ovarian cancer cell.
RESULTS: TAp63 levels were comparable in stage I and stage III, but deltaNp63
levels increased 77-fold in stage III, independently of the p53 status. Patients 
with high deltaNp63 expression had the worst overall survival (OS); patients with
a deltaNp63/TAp63 ratio >2 had a poor OS. Patients with a high deltaNp63/TAp63
ratio were those with a poor response to platinum-based therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate a role for deltaNp63 as a potential biomarker to
predict patient's outcome and tumor progression in ovarian cancer. This would
have particularly clinical relevance in ovarian cancer where the high rate of
mortality reflects our lack of knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying cell 
progression toward malignancy.

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The proteins p63, p-cadherin and CK5 are consistently
expressed by the basal and myoepithelial cells of the breast, although their
expression in sporadic and familial breast cancer cases has yet to be fully
defined. The aim here was to study the basal immunoprofile of a breast cancer
case series using tissue microarray technology.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study at Universidade Estadual de 
Campinas, Brazil, and the Institute of Pathology and Molecular Immunology, Porto,
Portugal.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using the antibodies p63, CK5 and p-cadherin, and
also estrogen receptor (ER) and Human Epidermal Receptor Growth Factor 2 (HER2), 
was per-formed on 168 samples from a breast cancer case series. The criteria for 
identifying women at high risk were based on those of the Breast Cancer Linkage
Consortium.
RESULTS: Familial tumors were more frequently positive for the p-cadherin (p =
0.0004), p63 (p < 0.0001) and CK5 (p < 0.0001) than was sporadic cancer.
Moreover, familial tumors had coexpression of the basal biomarkers CK5+/ p63+,
grouped two by two (OR = 34.34), while absence of coexpression (OR = 0.13) was
associated with the sporadic cancer phenotype.
CONCLUSION: Familial breast cancer was found to be associated with basal
biomarkers, using tissue microarray technology. Therefore, characterization of
the familial breast cancer phenotype will improve the understanding of breast
carcinogenesis.

The presented data indicate that the p63 gene is required for the commitment of
epidermal stem cells in embryonic development. At the same time, p63 underlies
many functions involved in the self-renewal of stem cells in the adult epidermis.
Its expression provides for keratinocyte adhesion, inhibits apoptosis, and
maintains the integrity of the epidermal tissue.

p63 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family that is critical for
epithelial differentiation and also has an important role in cancer progression. 
Currently, the molecular mechanisms governing regulation of p63 function remain
largely unclear. This study identifies a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase for p63,
SCF(betaTrCP1). SCF(betaTrCP1) is able to bind p63gamma isoforms, with a higher
affinity for the TAp63gamma isoform. Strikingly, co-expression of TAp63gamma and 
betaTrCP1 leads to the stabilization of TAp63gamma. This stabilization of
TAp63gamma leads to up-regulation of p21 at the mRNA and protein level by
increased binding of TAp63gamma at the p21 promoter. The up-regulation of p21
causes a subsequent increase in G(1) phase cell cycle arrest. Last,
SCF(betaTrCP1) is able to ubiquitylate TAp63gamma, and this ubiquitylation, as
well as the increased activity of TAp63gamma, is ablated with the expression of a
ubiquitin-deficient mutant of betaTrCP1 (DeltaFbetaTrCP1). Therefore, our study
reveals that SCF(betaTrCP1) is an E3 ligase that activates p63 through
ubiquitylation.

p63 is an oncogene belonging to the p53 gene family. In normal human skin, p63 is
expressed by the least-differentiated keratinocytes of the epidermis and its
appendages, by myoepithelial cells of sweat glands, and by a wide variety of
primary tumors arising therefrom. The expression of p63 by metastatic skin tumors
has been more controversial. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of p63
detection in the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary
(metastatic) skin tumors. The expression of p63 was studied in 45 cases of
cutaneous metastases, mostly of known primary origin, and 94 benign and malignant
epithelial primary skin tumors. p63 was expressed by 85 (89%) of 96 primary skin 
tumors and 5 (11%) of 45 cutaneous metastases. These results suggest that p63 may
be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of skin carcinomas; however, contrary to
what has been previously claimed, expression of p63 does not rule out the
metastatic origin of a cutaneous carcinoma.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease and although
classified by WHO as a premalignant condition, the risk for transformation into
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is a matter of great
controversy. The p63 gene encodes six different proteins which are required for
development of ectodermally derived tissues such as oral mucosa, salivary glands,
teeth and skin. p63 is highly expressed in SCCHN whereas decreased expression is 
seen in OLP. beta-catenin, E-cadherin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
are p63 related proteins, and abnormalities in their expression suggested they
are involved in development of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(SCCHN). In this study we mapped the expression of these p63 related proteins in 
OLP and matched normal healthy controls. Results showed decreased expression of
beta-catenin, E-cadherin and EGFR in the vast majority of OLP samples compared
with the normal controls. This is the first comprehensive study mapping
expression of several p63- and SCCHN-related proteins in tissue from patients
with OLP. Results showed a mixed expression pattern with OLP variably resembling 
normal as well as tumour tissue. Based on our present and previous data it cannot
be judged whether OLP lesions are at an increased risk of malignant development.

DeltaNp63 isoforms regulate CD44 and keratins 4, 6, 14 and 19 in squamous cell

The human p63 gene codes for multiple protein isoforms and is commonly
over-expressed in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). This
expression is predominantly of the DeltaN- and beta-isoforms, the former lacking 
the p53-related transactivation domain. p63 can activate or repress transcription
of p53 and p73 target genes, but also has unique transcriptional targets and,
unlike other p53 family members, is required for normal development and
differentiation of squamous epithelia. We have identified novel targets of p63,
using microarray analysis of SCCHN cells that stably over-express individual
DeltaNp63 isoforms. All three isoforms induced expression of the cancer stem cell
marker, CD44, with the DeltaNp63beta isoform showing strongest induction. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation, we were unable to show direct binding of p63 to
the CD44 promoter, but found that p63 specifically increased expression of CD44
lacking variant exon 2. Each of the DeltaNp63 isoforms up-regulated expression of
keratins 6A and 14 and down-regulated expression of keratins 4 and 19, in keeping
with their expression patterns in SCCHN. The data strengthen the idea that p63
has key roles in regulating normal and abnormal differentiation processes through
both induction and repression of genes with opposite functions. The
identification of up-regulation and differential splicing of CD44 following p63
over-expression indicates roles in the regulation of adhesion, metastasis and the
cancer stem cell phenotype.

Hay-Wells syndrome is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, also known as AEC
syndrome (Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, Ectodermal effects, Cleft
lip/palate). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable
expression, featuring congenital abnormalities of skin, hair, teeth, nail,
eccrine and mucous glands. We present a three-month-old boy, born to unaffected
parents, with typical clinical findings of AEC syndrome. In this boy, a mutation 
Ile537Thr (c.1610C>T) in the sterile alpha motive (SAM) domain of the TP73L (p63)
gene was detected. Because of the broad spectrum of related syndromes such as
Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome, Bowen-Armstrong syndrome, CHAND syndrome and epidermolysis
bullosa hereditaria, the diagnosis of AEC should be base don both clinical
findings and genetic analysis.

p63 is a member of the p53 family and regulates crucial events in the formation
of epithelial structures, but the role of p63 in tumor is unclear. We found that 
Snail-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is accompanied by
down-regulation of p63 in human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). DeltaNp63alpha is
the predominantly expressed p63 isoform in SCC cells. DeltaNp63 promoter activity
required a CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding element and was reduced 
remarkably by Snail. Down-regulation of DeltaNp63alpha and reduction of
C/EBPalpha were observed in EMT phenotype cells, which exhibited invasive
activity in vitro. p63 knockdown in cells enhanced invasive activity in the
presence of E-cadherin. Conversely, forced expression of DeltaNp63alpha blocked
invasive activity of cells with the EMT phenotype. These findings indicate that
Snail down-regulates DeltaNp63alpha, leading to acquisition of the invasive
phenotype by SCC. The invasive activity caused by down-regulation of
DeltaNp63alpha does not require down-regulation of E-cadherin.

OBJECTIVES: Urothelial carcinoma is a frequent and aggressive cancer. To gain
better insight into the early molecular mechanisms of bladder carcinogenesis,
this study analyzed the expression levels of four selected genes (uroplakin II,
TATA-BOX-binding protein (TBP/RNA) control gene (NM_00394), and the two main
isoforms TATp63 and deltaNp63 of p63).
METHODS: We used real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction in dissected tissues from normal bladder, noninvasive cancer, and
muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (n = 49). The gene expression levels were
compared at different stages of bladder cancer. To confirm the results on protein
levels, we used immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays of the same samples.
RESULTS: The expression of the p63 gene studied was significantly deregulated,
with decreasing levels in early cancer versus normal tissue.
Immunohistochemistry, performed on the same samples, using p63 antibody,
confirmed the results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight that among the genes strongly
deregulated in urothelial carcinoma, p63 is already abnormally expressed in the
early stages.

BACKGROUND: Genetic experiments have clarified that p63 is a key transcription
factor governing the establishment and maintenance of multilayered epithelia. Key
to our understanding of p63 strategy is the identification of target genes. We
perfomed an RNAi screening in keratinocytes for p63, followed by profiling
analysis.
RESULTS: C/EBPdelta, member of a family with known roles in differentiation
pathways, emerged as a gene repressed by p63. We validated C/EBPdelta as a
primary target of DeltaNp63alpha by RT-PCR and ChIP location analysis in HaCaT
and primary cells. C/EBPdelta is differentially expressed in stratification of
human skin and it is up-regulated upon differentiation of HaCaT and primary
keratinocytes. It is bound to and activates the DeltaNp63 promoter.
Overexpression of C/EBPdelta leads to alteration in the normal profile of p63
isoforms, with the emergence of DeltaNp63beta and gamma, and of the TA isoforms, 
with different kinetics. In addition, there are changes in the expression of most
p63 targets. Inactivation of C/EBPdelta leads to gene expression modifications,
in part due to the concomitant repression of DeltaNp63alpha. Finally, C/EBPdelta 
is found on the p63 targets in vivo by ChIP analysis, indicating that
coregulation is direct.
CONCLUSION: Our data highlight a coherent cross-talk between these two
transcription factors in keratinocytes and a large sharing of common
transcriptional targets.

BACKGROUND: P63 is the protein codified by p63 gene, a p53 gene homolog, known
for its pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, and involved in the tumor
differentiation. Aims of the present study were to assess the frequency and
pattern of p63 protein expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in
relation to the main tumour characteristics and to verify whether p63 can be
considered a marker of prognosis in patients with OSCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, a cohort of 64 OSCC patients was 
investigated for p63 protein expression and its cellular localization by
immunohistochemistry (monoclonal mouse anti-human p63 protein-clone 4A4). After
grouping by p63 expression, OSCCs were statistically analyzed for the variables
age, gender, histological grading (G), TNM, staging, recurrence, and overall
survival rate.
RESULTS: The overall frequency of p63 overexpressed was of 57.8 percent. Various 
p63 staining patterns were observed according to G score, with a significant
correlation between p63 overexpression and the lowest G score (P < 0.0001). No
statistically significant difference was found between p63 pattern expression and
age, sex, staging. OSCC patients with p63 overexpressed were found to have a
poorer survival rate with respect to OSCCs with a normal pattern of expression (P
= 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, it is possible to suggest p63 pattern
expression as a reliable indicator of histological grading and an early marker of
poor prognosis.

The identification of stem cells and differentiation programs regulating the
development and maintenance of the normal prostate epithelium is essential for
the identification of the cell type(s) and molecular alterations involved in the 
development and propagation of prostate cancer (CaP). The p53-homologue p63 is
highly expressed in normal prostate basal cells and is a clinically useful
biomarker for the diagnosis of CaP. Importantly, p63 has been shown to play a
critical role in prostate development. Recent experimental evidence also suggests
that this gene is essential for normal stem cell function in the prostate as well
as other epithelial organs. Future studies aimed at better defining the role of
p63 in the renewal of the adult prostate epithelium are likely to shed new light 
on the mechanisms involved in prostate carcinogenesis.

p53 plays a sentinel role in the pathways that prevent development of cancer by
inducing apoptosis, DNA repair and cell-cycle arrest in response to different
types of cellular stress. The majority of head and neck tumours harbour mutations
affecting the p53 gene, and those tumours that seemingly have wild-type p53
protein most probably lack a functional p53 response as a result of mutations
affecting other genes that function in the same pathways as p53. This report
provides an up-to-date overview of what is known about how p53 exerts its
effects. We also summarize what is known about the other p53 family members, p63 
and p73, and show how they act together to influence the response to treatment.
No other commonly occurring signature mutation has emerged for this tumour type, 
and this means that the p53 family has emerged as the frontrunner in terms of
providing molecular targets that can provide new diagnostic, prognostic and
therapeutic approaches.

PURPOSE: SCC-112 is a novel cell cycle-related gene and differentially expressed 
in cancers. Suggesting the complex role of SCC-112 might be existent in cell
proliferation and tumor development. The relative research on SCC-112 has been
few so far. This study is attempted to explore the role of SCC-112 in
tumorigenesis.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RT-PCR and western blot were performed on seven tumor-normal
paired tissues and nine cell lines. Immunohistochemistry was carried out for
analyzing the expression of SCC-112 in nasopharyngeal tissues. 293T and three
nasopharyngeal cell lines were transfected with expression vector
(pCMV-SPORT6-SCC-112) or its siRNA. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT and
clone formation experiments. Immunoprecipitation determined the interacted
protein of SCC-112, and FACS detected cell cycle parameter on cells treated with 
synchronized reagent.
RESULTS: SCC-112 ( approximately 150 kDa) is up-regulated in tumor tissue as
compared to the corresponding normal tissue and was detected in the tested cell
lines. Overexpression of SCC-112 ( approximately 150 kDa) in 293T and three
nasopharyngeal cell lines promoted cell proliferation and clone formation while
downregulation of SCC-112 ( approximately 150 kDa) in these cells resulted in the
opposite. Moreover, SCC-112 was found to interact with p63 and overexpression of 
SCC-112 up-regulated p63 expression. SCC-112 expression level positively
correlated with cells in G2/M phase.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SCC-112 improve cell proliferation and
contributes to tumorigenesis by interacting with p63 and promoting cell cycling. 
SCC-112 might be an alternative target in tumor biomarking and mechanistic
investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular mechanism of TAp63gamma-induced cell apoptosis.
METHODS: Transcription and protein expression of apoptosis inducing factor and
p63 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR in human esophageal
squamous carcinoma cell line EC9706 respectively. Twenty-four hours after
transfection with pcDNA3.1-TAp63gamma, the apoptosis and translocation of
apoptosis inducing factor in EC9706 cells were studied by flow cytometry, laser
confocal microscopy and mitochondrial/cytosol/nuclear extraction analysis
respectively. Down-regulation of apoptosis inducing factor protein was achieved
by RNAi and pretreatment with caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk of EC9706 cells.
RESULTS: Presence of protein expressions of apoptosis inducing factor and absence
of TAp63gamma was observed in the cytoplasm of untransfected cells. RT-PCR
verified the subtype of p63 in EC9706 cells was DeltaNp63. After 24 hours of
transfection, both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of apoptosis inducing
factor protein were observed in cells transfected with TAp63gamma and p53
expression vectors, but not in cells transfected with control vector. Cell
apoptosis rates were 1.37%, 13.64%, 4.52%, 4.03% and 1.91% in the pcDNA3.1
transfection group, pcDNA3.1-TAp63gamma transfection group, apoptosis inducing
factor siRNA and pcDNA3.1-TAp63gamma transfection group, zVAD.fmk treatment
group, and the group receiving apoptosis inducing factor siRNA, plus zVAD.fmk
treatment and pcDNA3.1-TAp63gamma transfection, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis inducing factor of EC9706 cells is released from
mitochondria into both the cytoplasm and nucleus during TAp63gamma induced
apoptosis. Down-regulation of apoptosis inducing factor inhibits
TAp63gamma-induced apoptosis. Overall, TAp63gamma-induced apoptosis is dependent 
on the expression of apoptosis inducing factor and caspase.

p63, a recently identified homologue of the p53 protein, is expressed
consistently in basal cells of several human multilayered epithelia. In this
study, expression of p63 was determined in 31 primary cutaneous glandular
carcinomas, including sebaceous, perianal (hepatoid) gland, apocrine and
ceruminous carcinomas, as well as their adjacent normal skin. Similar to humans, 
p63 is a reliable marker for basal and myoepithelial cells in canine epidermis,
cutaneous appendages and malignant apocrine and ceruminous gland neoplasms. In
sebaceous carcinomas, not only basal cells, but also some sebocytes, showed
nuclear staining for p63. Most mature epithelial cells in perianal gland
carcinomas exhibited strong p63 expression. Based on these findings,
basal/myoepithelial cells could be involved in the oncogenesis of these tumours
and p63 might be used as a diagnostic marker in these lesions.

Chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CUS) is a recently described mucocutaneous
condition in which patients experience chronic, painful, ulcerative lesions of
the oral mucosa. CUS is diagnosed by immunofluorescence studies that demonstrate 
antinuclear antibodies. These autoantibodies are specific for a protein,
deltaNp63alpha, which is normally expressed in basal cell nuclei of stratified
squamous epithelia. The purpose of this study was to characterize the autoimmune 
response in CUS. Protein antigens were produced by in vitro
transcription/translation of polymerase chain-reaction (PCR)-amplified cDNAs. We 
used immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments with serum from CUS
patients to examine the (1) antibody isotype, (2) immunogenic functional domains 
of the deltaNp63alpha antigen, and (3) cross-reactivity with homologous p53, p73,
and p63 proteins. Results demonstrate CUS patient antibodies to deltaNp63alpha,
and 52% of cases have circulating IgA isotype antibodies. The N-terminal and
DNA-binding domains are the immunodominant regions, and antibody cross-reactivity
with p53, p63, and p73 isoforms is limited.

Differential regulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) by the p53 Family:
p73-dependent induction of VDR upon DNA damage.

p63 and p73, members of the p53 family, have been shown to be functionally
distinct from p53. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand (vitamin D(3))-dependent 
transcription factor, which is shown to play a major role in calcium homeostasis 
and keratinocyte differentiation. Vitamin D and its analogues in combination with
DNA-damaging agents are extensively used for cancer chemotherapy. In this report,
we examined whether p53 affects p63-mediated induction of VDR and studied the
effect of DNA damage on VDR induction in p53 null cell lines. Our results
demonstrate that p53 itself does not induce VDR expression, nor does it affect
p63-mediated VDR induction in the cell lines tested in this study. Furthermore,
we observed p53-independent activation of VDR upon DNA damage and associated the 
induction of VDR to p73. We have demonstrated that ectopic expression of various 
p73 isoforms can induce VDR expression. Inhibition of p73 in cells treated with
DNA-damaging agents exhibited decreased VDR expression. Finally, we show that
upon DNA damage, induction of VDR sensitizes the cells to vitamin D treatment. In
conclusion, our results indicate that VDR is regulated by p63 and p73 and that
the induction of VDR expression upon DNA damage is p73-dependent.

Primary cutaneous carcinosarcomas (PCCs) are rare malignant neoplasms that are
characterized by biphasic epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. When the
biphasic nature is not evident, immunohistochemical studies may be important in
the diagnosis of PCCs. Although AE1/AE3 is frequently used to demonstrate the
epithelial component, it may not be strongly expressed in epithelial cells that
are not well-differentiated. p63 is a protein homologue of p53 that is expressed 
in poorly differentiated epithelial cells. We report 3 cases of PCC. The clearly 
epithelial areas of each tumor were frequently positive for both markers, whereas
the sarcomatous areas were negative for both markers. Epithelial cells that were 
poorly differentiated and not easily identifiable were positive for p63 but
negative for AE1/AE3. Of interest, transitional areas showed positivity for p63
alone. These 3 cases suggest that the use of both p63 and routine cytokeratin
markers such as AE1/AE3 can increase the sensitivity for distinguishing
epithelial cells over a range of differentiation states, which we propose will
aid in the diagnosis of PCCs. In addition, the staining pattern of AE1/AE3 and
p63 in these cases further supports the conversion theory of PCC.

We report here that human MFGE8 encoding milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein
(MFG-E8), also termed 46 kDa breast epithelial antigen and lactadherin, is
transcriptionally activated by p63, or TP63, a p53 (TP53) family protein
frequently overexpressed in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas, mammary
carcinomas and so on. Despite that human MFG-E8 was originally identified as a
breast cancer marker, and has recently been reported to provide peptides for
cancer immunotherapy, its transcriptional control remains an open question.
Observations in immunohistochemical analyses, a tetracycline-induced p63
expression system and keratinocyte cultures suggested a physiological link
between p63 and MFGE8. By reporter assays with immediately upstream regions of
MFGE8, we determined that the trans-activator (TA) isoforms of p63 activate MFGE8
transcription though a p53/p63 motif at -370, which was confirmed by a chromatin 
immunoprecipitation experiment. Upon siRNA-mediated p63 silencing in a squamous
cell carcinoma line, MFG-E8 production decreased to diminish Saos-2 cell
adhesion. Interestingly, the DeltaN-p63 isoform lacking the TA domain enhanced
the MFGE8-activating function of TA-p63, if DeltaN-p63 was dominant over TA-p63
as typically observed in undifferentiated keratinocytes and squamous cell
carcinomas, implying a self-regulatory mechanism of p63 by the TA:DeltaN
association. MFG-E8 may provide a novel pathway of epithelial-nonepithelial cell 
interactions inducible by p63, probably in pathological processes.

Since p63-deficient mice display severe defects in formation of epidermis, p63
has been considered to be a multi-isoform p53 family member essential for
epidermal development. However, it is still unclear how p63 could contribute to
keratinocyte differentiation. In the present study, we have found that TAp63alpha
is induced in association with the upregulation and a secretion of growth
differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) during the keratinocyte differentiation of
HaCaT cells bearing p53 mutation. Short interference RNA-mediated knockdown of
the endogenous TAp63 resulted in a remarkable reduction of GDF15. Luciferase
reporter assay and reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that enforced 
expression of TAp63alpha significantly increases the luciferase activity driven
by GDF15 promoter and the expression of GDF15. Consistent with these results, the
proximal p53/p63-binding site within the GDF15 promoter region was required for
the TAp63alpha-mediated transcriptional activation of GDF15, and TAp63alpha was
recruited onto this site. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous
GDF15 permitted cell growth and inhibited the expression of the differentiation
markers such as keratin 10 and involucrin in response to differentiation stimuli.
Taken together, our present results provide a novel insight into understanding
the molecular mechanisms behind TAp63alpha-mediated keratinocyte differentiation.

The epidermis is a multi-layered stratified epithelium continuously renewed by
differentiating keratinocytes that develops by the action of p63, a member of the
p53 family. The TP63 contains two promoters, resulting in the expression of
different proteins, containing (TAp63) or not (DeltaNp63) an amino-terminal
transactivation domain, which contribution in skin formation is not fully
understood. We found that p63 binds and transactivate GATA-3 promoter, which in
turn transactivate IKKalpha, two pivotal regulators of epithelial development.
Indeed, GATA-3 is a regulator of cell lineage in skin and hair follicles
formation. To further study the relationship between GATA-3 and p63 isoforms here
we investigated their expression during keratinocyte differentiation, in human
epidermis and hair follicle.

p63 is a member of the p53 protein family that regulates differentiation and
morphogenesis in epithelial tissues and is required for the formation of squamous
epithelia. Barrett's mucosa is a glandular metaplasia of the squamous epithelium 
that develops in the lower esophagus in the context of chronic, gastroesophageal 
reflux and is considered as a precursor for adenocarcinoma. Normal or squamous
cancer esophageal cells were exposed to deoxycholic acid (DCA, 50, 100, or 200
microM) and chenodeoxycholic and taurochenodeoxycholic acid at pH 5. p63 and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions were studied by Western blot and RT-PCR. DCA
exposure at pH 5 led to a spectacular decrease in the levels of all isoforms of
the p63 proteins. This decrease was observed within minutes of exposure, with a
synergistic effect between DCA and acid. Within the same time frame, levels of
p63 mRNA were relatively unaffected, whereas levels of COX-2, a marker of stress 
responses often induced in Barrett's mucosa, were increased. Similar results were
obtained with chenodeoxycholic acid but not its taurine conjugate at pH 5.
Proteasome inhibition by lactacystin or MG-132 partially blocked the decrease in 
p63, suggesting a posttranslational degradation mechanism. These results show
that combined exposure to bile salt and acid downregulates a critical regulator
of squamous differentiation, providing a mechanism to explain the replacement of 
squamous epithelium by a glandular metaplasia upon exposure of the lower
esophagus to gastric reflux.

Increases in the number of allelic malformation syndromes have led to their
classification according to their pathogenesis rather than their clinical
specific phenotype. TP63 (also known as TP73L) mutations have been identified in 
several such syndromes characterized by autosomal dominant transmission and
various combinations of ectodermal dysplasia, limb malformations and orofacial
clefting. TP63 has not yet been implicated in early aging phenotype in humans,
even though p63 activates a program of cellular senescence and p63-compromised
mice display features of accelerated aging. We report on a family with four
affected adult females presenting with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS), an autosomal 
dominant clinical entity that associates anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with
cleft lip and palate. Features between RHS and EEC syndrome (ectrodactyly,
ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate) have led to the recent identification 
of mutations in the TP63 gene, located on 3q27, in this condition. Our patients
present typical clinical features of RHS, but also ophthalmic anomalies such as
corneal dystrophy and premature menopause (around 30 years). The latter findings 
have never been reported in this condition, and could be secondary to a new TP63 
deletion that has been identified in this family.

The present study examines the expression of p63, glutathione S-transferase-pi
(GSTP1) and alpha-methylacyl-CoAracemase (AMACR) in serial slices in
proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) in order to implicate that some of the
basal cells are probably the putative human prostate carcinoma stem cells
(PHPCSC). Archived tissue sections obtained after radical prostatectomy from
cases (n=30) comprising of PIA were tested using immunohistochemistry with
antibodies against AMACR (Dako), p63 and GSTP1 (Labvision) and visualized by
biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase kit (DAKO LSAB 2 kit). Quantitative
immunohistochemistry analysis (QIHC) of the studied antigen expression levels
revealed that there are two populations of p63 basal cells. Type I basal cells
had high AMACR, low GSTP1 and p63 expression. Type II basal cells had low AMACR, 
high GSTP1 and p63 expression. Therefore, we propose that the putative human
prostate carcinoma stem cells probably reside within the population of type I
basal cells.

Cervical carcinoma is associated with certain types of human papillomaviruses
expressing the E6 and E7 oncogenes, which are involved in carcinogenesis through 
their interactions with the p53 and pRB pathways, respectively. A critical event 
on the path to malignant transformation is often manifested by the loss of
expression of the viral E2 transcription factor due to the integration into the
host genome of the viral DNA. Using microarrays, we have previously shown that
reintroduction of a functional E2 in the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line
activates a cluster of p53 target genes while at the same time severely
repressing a group of E2F target genes. In the present study, using new
high-density microarrays containing more than 22,000 human cDNA sequences, we
identified a novel p63 pathway among E2-activated genes and 38 new mitotic genes 
repressed by E2. We then sought to determine the pathways through which these
genes were modulated and used an approach that relies on small interfering RNA to
demonstrate that the p63 target genes were activated through silencing of the
E6/E6AP pathway while the mitotic genes were mainly repressed through E7
silencing. Importantly, a subset of the mitotic genes was shown to be
significantly induced in biopsies of stage IV cervical cancers, which points to a
prominent E7 pathway in cervical carcinoma.

p63 is a p53-related transcription factor. Utilization of two different promoters
and alternative splicing at the C terminus lead to generation of six isoforms.
The alpha isoforms of TAp63 and DeltaNp63 contain a transactivation-inhibitory
(TI) domain at the C termini, which can bind to the transactivation (TA) domain
and inhibit its transcriptional activity. Consequently, TAp63alpha can directly
inhibit its activity through an intramolecular interaction; similarly,
DeltaNp63alpha can inhibit the activity of the active TAp63 isoforms through an
intermolecular interaction. In this work, we demonstrate that after induction of 
apoptosis, the TI domain of the p63alpha isoforms is cleaved by activated
caspases. Cleavage of DeltaNp63alpha relieves its inhibitory effect on the
transcriptionally active p63 proteins, and the cleavage of TAp63alpha results in 
production of a TAp63 protein with enhanced transcriptional activity. In
agreement with these data, generation of the N-terminal TAp63 fragment has a role
in apoptosis because stable cell lines expressing wild-type TAp63 are more
sensitive to apoptosis compared with cells expressing the noncleavable mutant. We
also used a model system in which TAp63 expression was induced by trichostatin-A 
treatment in HCT116 cells. Trichostatin-A sensitized these cells to apoptosis,
and this sensitization was associated with cleavage of up-regulated p63.

p53 and p63 belong to a family of sequence-specific transcription factors
regulating key cellular processes. Differential composition of the p53 and p63
DNA-binding sites may contribute to distinct functions of these protein
homologues. We used SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment) methodology to identify nucleic acid ligands for p63. We found that
p63 bound preferentially to DNA fragments conforming to the 20 bp sequence
5'-RRRC(A/G)(A/T)GYYYRRRC(A/T)(C/T)GYYY-3'. Relative to the p53 consensus, the
p63 consensus DNA-binding site (DBS) was more degenerate, particularly at
positions 10 and 11, and was enriched for A/G at position 5 and C/T at position
16 of the consensus. The differences in DNA-binding site preferences between p63 
and p53 influenced their ability to activate transcription from select response
elements (REs) in cells. A computer algorithm, p63MH, was developed to find
candidate p63-binding motifs on input sequences. We identified genes responsive
to p63 regulation that contain functional p63 REs. Our results suggest that the
sequence composition of REs could be one contributing factor to target gene
discrimination between p63 and p53.

C/EBPdelta regulates cell cycle and self-renewal of human limbal stem cells.

Human limbal stem cells produce transit amplifying progenitors that migrate
centripetally to regenerate the corneal epithelium. Coexpression of CCAAT
enhancer binding protein delta (C/EBPdelta), Bmi1, and DeltaNp63alpha identifies 
mitotically quiescent limbal stem cells, which generate holoclones in culture.
Upon corneal injury, a fraction of these cells switches off C/EBPdelta and Bmi1, 
proliferates, and differentiates into mature corneal cells. Forced expression of 
C/EBPdelta inhibits the growth of limbal colonies and increases the cell cycle
length of primary limbal cells through the activity of p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2).
These effects are reversible; do not alter the limbal cell proliferative
capacity; and are not due to apoptosis, senescence, or differentiation.
C/EBPdelta, but not DeltaNp63alpha, indefinitely promotes holoclone self-renewal 
and prevents clonal evolution, suggesting that self-renewal and proliferation are
distinct, albeit related, processes in limbal stem cells. C/EBPdelta is recruited
to the chromatin of positively (p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2)) and negatively
(p16(INK4A) and involucrin) regulated gene loci, suggesting a direct role of this
transcription factor in determining limbal stem cell identity.

BACKGROUND: p63 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in skin
epidermal development and differentiation. The p63 gene encodes for two major
protein isoforms, those containing an amino-terminal trans-activation domain
(TAp63) and those lacking this domain (DeltaNp63). Both the TA and DeltaN
transcripts are also alternatively spliced at the 3' end producing proteins with 
unique C-termini that are designated as alpha, beta and gamma isoforms. Recent
research has suggested that DeltaNp63 is the predominant isoform expressed and
active in keratinocytes.
RESULTS: To better elucidate the biological role of p63 in regulating gene
expression in keratinocytes we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiments with DeltaNp63-specific antibodies. We included an additional step in
the ChIP procedure to enrich for DeltaNp63 targets by screening the library of
immunoprecipitated DNA for its ability to bind recombinant GST-DeltaNp63. Cloning
of DeltaNp63-ChIP-derived DNA fragments identified more than 60 potential
DeltaNp63 target loci that were located close to or embedded within known or
predicted genes. Identity of these target genes suggests that they may
participate in a myriad of cellular processes including transcriptional
regulation, signaling and metabolism. Here we confirm the binding of DeltaNp63 to
several of these genomic loci both by EMSA and replicate ChIP assays. Finally we 
show that the expression of many of these target genes is altered when DeltaNp63 
levels in keratinocytes are reduced by siRNA, further confirming that these are
bona fide targets.
CONCLUSION: This unbiased genomic approach has allowed us to uncover functional
targets of DeltaNp63 and serves as the initial step in further analysis of the
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that are governed by p63 in keratinocytes.

Z-ajoene is a garlic-derived compound with known anti-tumour properties. This
report argues in favour of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle blockage activities of
Z-ajoene on various cell lines involving activation of the p53-family gene
products, p53, p63 and p73, at indicated doses. According to its known
anti-proteasome activity, Z-ajoene induced a downregulation of MHC-class I
expression at the surface of treated cells but did not impair their recognition
by CD8+ T cells. We further demonstrated a new activity of Z-ajoene against human
cytomegalovirus spreading in vitro that was mediated by an increased number of
apoptotic cells after infection. Altogether our data point at the ubiquitous
efficiency of Z-ajoene as a new compound to fight against cancers of various
origins including those that put up viruses.

p63, a recently identified homologue of the p53 gene, is mainly expressed by
basal and myoepithelial cells in skin. Others and we have shown the value of p63 
in distinguishing primary adnexal tumors from visceral adenocarcinomas metastatic
to skin. We now investigate the pattern of p63 expression in metastases from skin
adnexal carcinomas and their cognate primaries and evaluate p63 expression in a
larger case series of malignant cutaneous adnexal neoplasms. Immunohistochemical 
analysis for p63 was performed on 13 metastases of adnexal carcinomas and their
corresponding primary tumors. Twenty visceral metastatic adenocarcinomas to the
skin and 7 primary mucinous carcinomas with cutaneous or visceral origin were
compared. The majority (90.9%) of primary adnexal tumors strongly expressed p63
and their metastases labeled similar to their cognate primary tumors. With one
exception, primary or metastatic mucinous carcinomas did not express p63.
Metastases from two apocrine carcinomas lacked p63 expression. All other
cutaneous metastases from internal adenocarcinomas were negative for p63.
Analysis of p63 expression may assist in the differential diagnosis of primary
adnexal carcinomas versus metastatic visceral adenocarcinomas to the skin.
Metastases from adnexal carcinomas generally retain p63 expression similar to
their associated primary tumors.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common lung disease predisposing 
lung cancer. To clarify the early phase of epithelial abnormalities in IPF, we
used an in vitro squamous metaplasia model, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF
beta1)-treated airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). The model repeated the
expression of squamous epithelial character, such as involucrin, and keratin 6
and 14. DNA microarray analysis disclosed a unique expression signature in TGF
beta1-treated airway epithelial cells, 20 specifically up-regulated genes
including p63, jagged 1 (jag1) and the genes of structure proteins. Western
blotting and RT-PCR analysis revealed that DeltaNp63alpha was the dominant
isoform of p63 in our experimental model. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated the expression of p63 and jag1 in lung tissues of IPF. Inhibition of
p63 with siRNA caused the down-regulation of jag1 expression, but not of
involucrin, or keratin 6 and 14. Interestingly, the up-regulation of p63 was
totally suppressed by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), but not by dexamethasone or
pirfenidone. Thus, the p63-jag1 pathway may be up-regulated at an early phase of 
epithelial abnormalities in IPF, which can be overcome by NAC even in the TGF
beta1-rich milieu.

To study the expression of p63 and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) in skin tumors and
evaluate the correlation between p63 and cox-2, the expressions of cox-2 and p63 
were measured by streptavidin-peroxidase complex immunohistochemical technique in
17 cases of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 19 cases of Bowen's
disease(Bowen), 11 cases of actinic keratosis(AK), 12 cases of seborreic
keratosis(SK) and 13 specimens of normal skin. Our results showed that the
expression of p63 in skin squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and actinic
keratosis were significantly higher than that in seborreic keratosis, while the
expression of p63 in seborreic keratosis was significantly higher than that in
normal skin. The expression of cox-2 in skin squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's
disease and actinic keratosis were significantly higher than that in seborreic
keratosis, while no statistical difference was noted in the expression of cox-2
between seborreic keratosis and normal skin. Cox-2 expression was positively
correlated with the high p63 expression in malignant skin tumors. The increased
expression of cox-2 and p63 may play an important role in the development of skin
tumors and work synergetically in malignant skin tumors.

The study was aimed to explore the possible roles of survivin and P63 protein in 
the development and progression of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and
their relation with cell apoptosis and proliferation. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end 
labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the survivin and
P63 protein expression, cell apoptosis and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) level in 43 cases of B-NHL and 10 cases of reactive hyperplasia lymphoid
(RHL) tissues. The results indicated that the positive rates of survivin and P63 
protein expression were 69.8% (30/43) and 82.7% (30/43) respectively. The
expression of survivin and P63 protein was 10% (1/10) and 40% (4/10) in RHL
tissues of 10 cases. The expression of survivin in aggression B-NHL was higher
than that in indolent B-NHL (83.3% vs 46.2%, P < 0.01). The expression of P63
proteins in aggressive B-NHL was higher than that in indolent B-NHL (86.7% vs
76.9%, P > 0.05). Apoptotic index (AI) and proliferation index (PI) correlated
positively with expression of survivin (r = 0.429, P < 0.01; r = 0.348, P <
0.01), and so do with expression of P63 proteins (r = 0.451, P < 0.01; r = 0.369,
P < 0.05). In addition, AI and PI were positively related (r = 0.598, P < 0.001).
It is concluded that survivin may participate in the regulation mechanism of
B-NHL cell apoptosis and proliferation, P63 as an oncogene enhances proliferation
and takes part in the development of B-NHL. There may be a close relationship
between survivin and P63 protein in the regulation of lymphocyte proliferative
kinetics.

Vesicular stomatitis virus infection triggers apoptosis associated with decreased

cell line.

In view of the powerful inherent oncolytic activity exhibited by the vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) in several tumor types, we set out to investigate the
susceptibility of the immortalized HaCaT keratinocyte cell line to VSV, and
analyzed the role of apoptosis in the VSV-mediated induction of cell death.
Indirect immunofluorescence assays, Western blot analyses and plaque titrations
demonstrated that the HaCaT cell line was permissive to VSV replication. The
results of ELISA for detection of the enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm 
of apoptotic cells revealed that VSV infection elicits the apoptotic death of
HaCaT cells. Mock-infected HaCaT cells displayed the endogenous expression of
DeltaNp63alpha, p53 mutated on UV hot spots (p53(mt)), Bcl-2 and p21 Bax. The
levels of DeltaNp63alpha and p53(mt) were decreased, Bcl-2 remained unaffected,
while the expressions of p21Bax and p18 Bax were increased in VSV-infected HaCaT 
cells. Together, these data demonstrate that VSV replicates efficiently and
triggers apoptosis in the immortalized HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. The
VSV-mediated alterations in the expressions of DeltaNp63alpha and Bax may be
implicated in the apoptotic responses of infected cells and may also sensitize to
other apoptotic stimuli. These findings may stimulate further studies with the
goal of developing VSV-based virotherapy into an effective modality for the
treatment of epithelial-derived malignant tumors of the skin.

The p63/p73 network mediates chemosensitivity to cisplatin in a biologically

Breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her2
amplification exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and clinical features,
and they comprise the majority of BRCA1-associated tumors. Here we demonstrated
that the p53 family member p63 controls a pathway for p73-dependent cisplatin
sensitivity specific to these "triple-negative" tumors. In vivo, DeltaNp63 and
TAp73 isoforms were coexpressed exclusively within a subset of triple-negative
primary breast cancers that commonly exhibited mutational inactivation of p53.
The DeltaNp63alpha isoform promoted survival of breast cancer cells by binding
TAp73 and thereby inhibiting its proapoptotic activity. Consequently, inhibition 
of p63 by RNA interference led to TAp73-dependent induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2
family members and apoptosis. Breast cancer cells expressing DeltaNp63alpha and
TAp73 exhibited cisplatin sensitivity that was uniquely dependent on TAp73. Thus,
in response to treatment with cisplatin, but not other chemotherapeutic agents,
TAp73 underwent c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation, which promoted dissociation of
the DeltaNp63alpha/TAp73 protein complex, TAp73-dependent transcription of
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and apoptosis. These findings define p63 as a 
survival factor in a subset of breast cancers; furthermore, they provide what we 
believe to be a novel mechanism for cisplatin sensitivity in these
triple-negative cancers, and they suggest that such cancers may share the
cisplatin sensitivity of BRCA1-associated tumors.

We report on two unrelated families with EEC syndrome (ectrodactyly, ectodermal
dysplasia, cleft lip/palate), each with an Arg227Gln TP63 gene mutation, where
the phenotype overlapped extensively with the allelic disorder, limb-mammary
syndrome (LMS). Features common to both families were an ectodermal dysplasia
principally affecting tooth, breast and nipple development, dacryostenosis and
severe micturition difficulties. Additional findings included post-axial digital 
hypoplasia, cleft uvula, anal stenosis, hypoplasia of the perineal body and
biopsy-proven interstitial cystitis. No individual had cleft lip. Split
hand-split foot malformation (SHFM) occurred in one child-born after the
molecular diagnosis was established. Unlike previous reports, the urinary
symptoms were refractory to treatment with oral Fibrase and persisted into
adulthood. Of the six cases/families now reported with EEC syndrome and Arg227Gln
TP63 mutation, four have manifested this distinct urological abnormality,
indicative of a genotype-phenotype correlation.

BACKGROUND: The p53 gene family consists of the three genes p53, p63 and p73,
which have polyhedral non-overlapping functions in pivotal cellular processes
such as DNA synthesis and repair, growth arrest, apoptosis, genome stability,
angiogenesis, development and differentiation. These genes encode
sequence-specific nuclear transcription factors that recognise the same
responsive element (RE) in their target genes. Their inactivation or aberrant
expression may determine tumour progression or developmental disease. The
discovery of several protein isoforms with antagonistic roles, which are produced
by the expression of different promoters and alternative splicing, widened the
complexity of the scenario of the transcriptional network of the p53 family
members. Therefore, the identification of the genes transactivated by p53 family 
members is crucial to understand the specific role for each gene in cell cycle
regulation. We have combined a genome-wide computational search of p53 family REs
and microarray analysis to identify new direct target genes. The huge amount of
biological data produced has generated a critical need for bioinformatic tools
able to manage and integrate such data and facilitate their retrieval and
analysis.
DESCRIPTION: We have developed the p53FamTaG database (p53 FAMily TArget Genes), 
a modular relational database, which contains p53 family direct target genes
selected in the human genome searching for the presence of the REs and the
expression profile of these target genes obtained by microarray experiments.
p53FamTaG database also contains annotations of publicly available databases and 
links to other experimental data. The genome-wide computational search of the REs
was performed using PatSearch, a pattern-matching program implemented in the
DNAfan tool. These data were integrated with the microarray results we produced
from the overexpression of different isoforms of p53, p63 and p73 stably
transfected in isogenic cell lines, allowing the comparative study of the
transcriptional activity of all the proteins in the same cellular
background.p53FamTaG database is available free at
http://www2.ba.itb.cnr.it/p53FamTaG/ CONCLUSION: p53FamTaG represents a unique
integrated resource of human direct p53 family target genes that is extensively
annotated and provides the users with an efficient query/retrieval system which
displays the results of our microarray experiments and allows the export of RE
sequences. The database was developed for supporting and integrating
high-throughput in silico and experimental analyses and represents an important
reference source of knowledge for research groups involved in the field of
oncogenesis, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.

p63: the phantom of the tumor suppressor.

The last twenty years of research into p53 function has revealed some fascinating
discoveries into the orchestration of tumor suppressor pathways with a multitude 
of putative drug targets being investigated. However, it was not until 1998 that 
the ancestral mother of p53 was documented. The eldest evolutionary conserved
homolog of the p53 family is known today as p63. Originally, it was thought p63
was another tumor suppressor that could function in a similar capacity to p53.
However, elegant demonstrations of the divergent roles that p63 plays as a key
transcriptional regulator of the proliferation and differentiation cascade in
stratified epithelia are documented. These data link deltaNp63alpha to adult
tissue stem cell regulation and possibly "cancer stem cells". p63 lacks mutation 
in cancer development, which is in stark contrast to the classically high
mutation status of p53 in a large compendium of cancer types. Perhaps suggesting 
a selective preference for p53 mutation. Why is p63 rarely mutated despite being 
part of the same gene family? Interestingly, p63 is often over-expressed and
amplified in cancer, thus revealing a paradox. Is p63 required to provide cancer 
cell populations with a selective advantage as much as a loss of p53 function by 
mutation? Has p53 been masking a "phantom" with promising features as a target
for drug development? Can we exploit the biochemical know how gained from the
mass of p53 research to further elucidate deltaNp63alpha gene function? In this
review, we will summarise the emerging advances that are elucidating
deltaNp63alpha as a promising drug target.

OBJECTIVE: To construct deltaNp63 specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing
plasmid,to examine its inhibitory effect to the expression of deltaNp63 protein
and mRNA in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCCB) , its effect on
TCCB cells cycle and proliferation.
METHODS: DeltaNp63 specific oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized. These
oligonucleotides were annealed to form double strand DNA fragments and this
fragment was cloned into Pgenesil-1 plasmid. The recombinant deltaNp63-shRNA
expression construct was confirmed by using Pst I + Sal I double digestion and by
sequencing. Fluorescence staining was used to confirm the success of transfection
in TCCB cells under the fluorescence microscope. The inhibitory effect of
deltaNp63-shRNA construct was examined with semi-quantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining
assay. The cell cycle of TCCB cells was assayed by flow cytometry (FCM). The
cellular proliferation of TCCB cells was assayed by tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
colorimetry.
RESULTS: The deltaNp63-shRNA expression plasmid was successfully constructed and 
transfected into TCCB cells. It can effectively reduce the expression of
deltaNp63 protein and mRNA. The reduction rate of deltaNp63 mRNA was 63.0%, and
the G0/G1 ratio was increased and S phase was decreased in transfected TCCB
cells. The cellular proliferation was also lower in transfected 5637 cells in
comparrison with that of non-transfected TCCB cells.
CONCLUSION: A deltaNp63-shRNA expression plasmid, constructed from Pgenesil-1
plasmid, can successfully be transfected into TCCB cells and can effectively
inhibit the expression of deltaNp63 protein and mRNA. It also can take part in
regulation of the cell cycling and inhibit the cellular proliferation of TCCB
cells.

The mechanism by which the p53 family of proteins coordinately regulates select
target genes after various types of cell stress is not well understood. To
further define factors that dictate regulation of target genes, we examined the
binding of p53, DeltaNp63alpha and RNA polymerase II (pol II) to the regulatory
regions of select target genes in primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs)
using chromatin immunoprecipitation. In rapidly proliferating cells, we observed 
constitutive binding of DeltaNp63alpha and varying levels of p53 binding, to
consensus sites in target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and
apoptosis. Following genotoxic stress, p53 occupancy increased whereas
DeltaNp63alpha occupancy decreased at the majority of binding sites examined.
Microarray analysis of transcripts isolated from HEKs ectopically expressing p53 
and DeltaNp63alpha revealed an inverse regulation of select target genes by the
two family members. Collectively, our results suggest that DeltaNp63alpha can
function as a repressor of select p53 target genes involved in growth arrest, DNA
repair and apoptosis, and that the location of the p53 consensus binding site(s) 
in a target gene may dictate whether pol II is constitutively bound in
proliferating cells.

Are interactions with p63 and p73 involved in mutant p53 gain of oncogenic
function?

Although still controversial, the presence of mutant p53 in cancer cells may
result in more aggressive tumors and correspondingly worse outcomes. The means by
which mutant p53 exerts such pro-oncogenic activity are currently under extensive
investigation and different models have been proposed. We focus here on a
proposed mechanism by which a subset of tumor-derived p53 mutants physically
interact with p53 family members, p63 and p73, and negatively regulate their
proapoptotic function. Both cell-based assays and knock-in mice expressing mutant
forms of p53 support this model. As more than half of human tumors harbor mutant 
forms of p53 protein, approaches aimed at disrupting the pathological
interactions among p53 family members might be of clinical value.

We showed that TAp63gamma regulates hOGG1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), we found that TAp63gamma binds to the hOGG1 promoter. Reintroduction of
wild-type TAp63gamma into HEK 293 cells, induced transcription of hOGG1 promoter,
leading to increase in RNA and protein. Using RNAi studies, we observed that
TAp63gamma-RNAi resulted in reduced hOGG1 RNA and protein in HeLa cells. This
decrease in hOGG1 expression was associated with reduced cell viability upon
oxidative damage. Taken together, our results indicate that hOGG1 is a direct
target of TAp63gamma, suggesting a role for TAp63gamma in oxidative damage and
repair.

At variance with other human malignancies, p53 mutations are not frequent in
thyroid cancer and are believed to be responsible mainly for cancer progression
to poorly differentiated and aggressive phenotype. p63 and p73, two proteins with
a high degree of homology with p53, are overexpressed in thyroid cancer, but
their role in cancer initiation or progression is controversial. Regulation of
p53 family protein function depends on: (1) the balance between the expression of
transcriptionally active (p53, TAp63, and TAp73) and inactive isoforms (DeltaNp63
and DeltaNp73); (2) their interaction and competition at DNA-responsive elements;
(3) their interaction with regulatory proteins, either inhibitory or activating. 
In thyroid cancer, therefore, although mutations of the p53 oncosuppressor
protein family are rare, other mechanisms are present, including aberrant
expression of p53 family dominant negative isoforms, up-regulation of inhibitory 
proteins, and functional inhibition of activating proteins. The overall result is
a defective oncosuppressor activity. These inactivating mechanisms may be present
in the early stages of thyroid cancer and in different cancer histotypes. A
better understanding of this complex network may not only ameliorate our
comprehension of cancer biology, but also open the possibility of innovative
diagnostic procedures and the development of targeted therapies.

DeltaNp63alpha promotes apoptosis of human epidermal keratinocytes.

Zhu L(1), Rorke EA, Eckert RL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case School of Medicine, Cleveland,
Ohio, USA.

In this study we show that deltaNp63alpha overexpression in primary human
epidermal keratinocytes causes decreased cell proliferation and increased
apoptosis. These changes are associated with increased levels of p21 and p27,
decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels, reduced mitochondrial membrane
potential, and enhanced procaspase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage.
Bcl-xS and Bax levels are increased and Bcl-xL level is reduced. p53 levels are
increased in the deltaNp63alpha-expressing cells and p53 overexpression
reproduces features of the deltaNp63alpha phenotype. Increased p53 expression
results in reduced deltaNp63alpha, suggesting that p53 may negatively regulate
deltaNp63alpha level. DeltaNp63alpha also induces apoptosis in HaCaT and SCC-13
cells, which encode inactive p53 genes, suggesting that the response is p53
independent in these cell lines. Both deltaNp63alpha and TAp63alpha reduce SCC-13
cell survival. These studies indicate that both deltaNp63alpha and TAp63alpha can
negatively regulate keratinocyte survival.

Paulo, Brazil. lucinei@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: The role of p53 and p63 proteins in the prognosis of oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) is still debatable. Our aim here was to investigate the
relationship between the immunoexpression of these proteins with some
clinicopathologic parameters of prognostic significance in OSCC.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from 106 patients were used
for study together with the following data: primary site, histologic
differentiation, recurrences, metastasis, disease-free survival and overall
survival (OS).
RESULTS: In OSCCs, the positive rate for p63 protein immunoexpression (87.8%) was
higher than p53 (52.8%). p53 expression correlated with metastasis. Tumors
negative for p53 and with strong intensity for p63 expression had a significantly
higher OS.
CONCLUSIONS: p53 overexpression is associated with a larger number of metastases 
and is correlated with a poor outcome as well as decreased intensity in p63
immunoexpression.

p53 plays a pivotal role in the prevention of human tumor formation. p73 and p63 
are new members of the p53 tumor suppressor family, which are becoming
increasingly recognized as important players in human tumorigenesis. However, the
roles of these proteins are not well elucidated in extrahepatic bile duct (EBD)
carcinoma. We examined expressions of the p63 and p73 genes and proteins in
normal biliary epithelia, biliary dysplasias, and EBD carcinomas using
immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis. p63 and p73 proteins were overexpressed
in 26.3 and 41.0% of EBD carcinomas, respectively. p63 protein expression was
more frequent in tumors with vascular invasion (P = 0.002) and distal location (P
= 0.04), while p73 expression was more common in cancers with deeper tumor
invasion (P = 0.04). Patients with tumors co-expressing both p63 and p73 were
found to have a significantly worse overall survival rate compared to those with 
either p63 or p73 expression (P < 0.05) as determined in univariate and
multivariate analyses. Our results strongly imply that the p53 family members
have different functions in EBD carcinomas. Our data also indicate that
interactions between p63 and p73 play an important role in tumorigenesis of EBD
carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Pure or metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a 
rare entity with an unclear pathogeny and aggressive clinical behaviour. An
attempt was made to characterize its differential immunohistochemical and
biological profile.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven cases of SCC (pure or not) of the breast were 
matched with 27 ductal invasive carcinomas (IDC) for age, tumour size, nodal
involvement and year of diagnosis. The expression levels of oestrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki-67, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
HER2, Cyclin Bl, hTERT, cytokeratins (CK) 5/6 and p63 were determined
immunohistochemically in both cohorts. The presence of the human papilloma virus 
(HPV) genome was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Pure and metaplastic SCC displayed common profiles typifying a basal
origin: they never expressed ER or PR, were HER2-negative in 93% of cases,
exhibited positivity for CK5/6 or EGF-R in 75% and 85%, and for p63 in 70% of
cases and were highly proliferative. These profiles were markedly different from 
those of matched controls (p<0.001 for five markers) except for HER2 and hTERT.
The HPVgenome was detected in 2 out of 14 cases (14%) of SCC.
CONCLUSION: The expression profile of SCC of the breast was markedly different
from that of IDC. A typical "basal-like" phenotype was displayed that may explain
part of their behaviour and justify specific therapeutic approaches. HPV
infection was not a leading oncogenic event in SCC of the breast.

p63 and p73 in human cancer: defining the network.

The p53-related genes p63 and p73 exhibit significant structural homology to p53;
however, they do not function as classical tumor suppressors and are rarely
mutated in human cancers. Both p63 and p73 exhibit tissue-specific roles in
normal development and a complex contribution to tumorigenesis that is due to
their expression as multiple protein isoforms. The predominant p63/p73 isoforms
expressed both in normal development and in many tumors lack the conserved
transactivation (TA) domain; these isoforms instead exhibit a truncated
N-terminus (DeltaN) and function at least in part as transcriptional repressors. 
p63 and p73 isoforms are regulated through both transcriptional and
post-translational mechanisms, and they in turn regulate diverse cellular
functions including proliferation, survival and differentiation. The net effect
of p63/p73 expression in a given context depends on the ratio of TA/DeltaN
isoforms expressed, on physical interaction between p63 and p73 isoforms, and on 
functional interactions with p53 at the promoters of specific downstream target
genes. These multifaceted interactions occur in diverse ways in tumor-specific
contexts, demonstrating a functional 'p53 family network' in human tumorigenesis.
Understanding the regulation and mechanistic contributions of p63 and p73 in
human cancers may ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities for a variety 
of these diseases.

The p63 gene encodes six splice variants expressed with transactivating or
dominant-negative activities. Animal studies with p63 -/- mutants have suggested 
that p63 is important for proper development of several organs, including tooth
and salivary gland. Moreover, mutations of p63 have been detected in patients
affected by ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefts. To clarify the 
role of p63 in craniofacial development, we have studied the localization of p63 
protein in human and rat oral tissues using immunohistochemistry. p63
immunostaining was identified in the enamel organ, oral epithelium and developing
salivary glands. All compartments of the enamel organ were immunolabelled,
whereas only basal and some suprabasal cells of the oral epithelium were stained.
Ectomesenchyme-derived cells, including pulp cells, odontoblasts, bone cells and 
chondrocytes, were negative. The staining pattern was identical in human and rat 
tissues. These data lend support to the hypothesis that p63 is involved in growth
and differentation of ectoderm-derived oral tissues and may be useful to clarify 
molecular and developmental aspects observed in animal knockout experiments and
human syndromes related to p63 gene alteration.

The transcription factor p63 belongs to a family of regulatory proteins that bind
DNA in a sequence-specific manner, close to a target gene, to activate or repress
its transcription. These proteins display a striking conservation of functional
domains, but are differentially involved in regulating cellular processes. Nearly
a decade after the discovery of p63, its critical role for proper epithelial
development, maintenance and tumorigenesis is widely recognized. Several
important cellular endpoints have been linked to p63 regulation in epithelium,
including differentiation, cell fate specification, proliferation, survival,
senescence, apoptosis, cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction programs. Although a
large number of genes have been associated with p63-dependent regulation, only a 
few of these have been validated as direct p63 transcriptional targets. The
challenge still remains to define the p63 transcriptome in epithelial cells, and 
to dissect the cellular mechanisms used to modulate the expression of this
transcriptional profile. In this article we will review current knowledge
regarding the basic mechanisms used by p63 to regulate gene expression. Also, we 
will discuss specific p63-regulated biological endpoints in epithelial cells and 
the specific genes that have been linked to p63 regulation in these particular
contexts.

p63 is a transcription factor with a "master" role in the asymmetric cell
division of stratified epithelia. The transcriptional strategy is exerted by
activating and repressing a wide range of genes. Our understanding of the
pathways and networks controlled by p63 is starting to emerge, thanks to
profiling arrays and ChIP on chip experiments. We discuss recent advancements in 
the identification of bona fide targets, which suggests that several independent,
as well as interconnected pathways are controlled by p63. Not surprisingly, the
list includes genes previously shown to play a key role in differentiation
processes, as well as targets involved in cell cycle control, signaling and
transcription.

p63 plays a more complex role than initially thought in cancer and development.
As a p53 homolog, p63 encodes transcription factors that primarily functions
through regulation of downstream gene expression. However, p63 is also involved
in RNA processing and activation of beta-catenin signaling. A number of genes
activated by TAp63 support the notion that p63 is involved in tight
transcriptional control of epithelial differentiation, cell adhesion, and
tumorigenesis via cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and other cellualr functions. In 
addition, DeltaNp63 isotypes retain a rather short transactivation domain and
were found to transcriptionally regulate a specific set of downstream gene
targets. We found that p63 is capable of activating gene expression through
binding to specific cis-elements, RE1 and RE2, with the latter being more
specific for p63 than for p53. Differences in p53 family members DNA binding may 
help to explain key differences in their function and biology.

The development of stratified epithelia and their derivatives is a complex
process requiring a multifaceted transcriptional program. p63, the p53-related
transcription factor, is fundamental to this process. However, the underlying
mechanisms by which p63 exerts its influence on stratified epithelial development
and integrity remain elusive. Recent work from our laboratories has demonstrated 
that p63 mediates its effects on stratified epithelial function at least in part 
via its ability to regulate multiple aspects of epithelial cellular adhesion and 
survival. The identification of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion subprograms
downstream of p63 provides an initial understanding of p63's role in epithelial
development, integrity and homeostasis.

Papillary breast lesions remain a source of diagnostic confusion because the full
range of epithelial proliferations may arise within, or secondarily involve,
papilloma. The expression of p63 and high-molecular-weight cytokeratins (HMWCK)
was studied simultaneously in 33 papillary lesions including intraductal
papilloma (IP, n = 10), atypical papilloma (AP, n = 8) and intraductal papillary 
carcinoma (IPC, n = 15) by double immunostaining. The myoepithelial cell nuclei
were stained dark brown whereas the cytoplasms of usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH) 
and myoepithelium were stained purple. The myoepithelial layer was recognized as 
a dark brown dotted line at the epithelial stromal junction in all IP (10/10),
most AP (7/8) and some IPC (7/15), suggesting that the retained myoepithelial
layer in the papillary processes does not necessarily guarantee benignity.
However, the malignant epithelial cells in AP and IPC were typically recognized
as monotonous populations unstained with either chromogen. These monotonous cells
contrasted with the proliferating cells of UDH in papilloma, which had intense
purple cytoplasm in a mosaic-like fashion. The present data suggest that the
double immunostaining with the two popular antibodies p63 and HMWCK is a useful
tool for reproducible classification of papillary breast lesions.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cultivated limbal stem cell transplantation is being
used as a current treatment modality for limbal stem cell deficiency. However,
use of allogenic biological material as substrate is associated with risks of
transmission of certain diseases and allograft rejection. Therefore development
of non-toxic biodegradable synthetic polymers is important. We undertook this
study to evaluate the use of a synthetic polymer Mebiol gel as a substrate for
the growth of limbal phenotype cells and cornea phenotype cells from limbal
explants.
METHODS: Human cadaveric limbal explants cells were cultivated on Mebiol gel. The
proliferative capacity of cultivated cells was analyzed with thymidine
incorporation studies. Immunostaining for presumed limbal stem cell association
markers and cornea differentiation markers was performed and confirmed with
reverse transcription (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: The limbal explants underwent proliferation in vitro. The cultivated
cells expressed the presumed limbal stem cell association markers (ABCG2 and
p63), the transient amplifying cell markers (connexin 43, integrin alpha9) and
the cornea differentiation marker (K3). RT PCR confirmed the immunohistochemical 
data.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the synthetic polymer
Mebiol gel was able to support limbal explant proliferation. The cultured cells
expressed presumed limbal stem cell association markers, transient amplifying
cells and cornea phenotype markers. Mebiol Gel can be used as a scaffold for
growing limbal explants.

Molecular links between apoptosis, tumorigenesis and drug resistance provide
starting points for new therapeutic approaches and for a targeted cancer therapy.
The discovery of the p53-related genes p63 and p73 raised the possibility that
they may be cancer-associated genes and as a consequence that p53 is not the only
component in predicting prognosis and response to chemotherapy, but instead the
status of a network that contains p53, p73 and p63. This review focuses on the
status and interrelationship of the p53 family members in human cancer as
critical elements for tumor progression and response to therapy. Literature up to
December 2006 is reviewed. p63 and p73--as well as p53--each use multiple
promoters and alternative splicing to generate an array of isoforms, including
full-length isoforms with a transactivation (TA-) domain homologous to that of
full-length p53, and amino-terminally truncated (DeltaN-) isoforms. Whereas the
full-length TA isoforms of p63 and p73 can activate downstream target genes and
induce apoptosis, the DeltaN isoforms which lack the transactivation domain can
act as dominant inhibitors of the full-length forms of p53, p63 and p73,
inhibiting transactivation of target genes and induction of apoptosis.
Deregulated dominant negative p63 and p73 isoforms play an oncogenic role in
human cancer and contribute to chemoresistance. Thus, therapeutic modulation of
TAp63/DeltaNp63, TAp73/DeltaNp73 and mutant p53 levels might be used to target
the large percentage of human tumors that harbor p53 mutations and/or overexpress
DeltaNp63 or DeltaNp73. Interfering with the expression or function of DeltaNp63 
and/or DeltaNp73 and/or mutant p53 in tumor cells may render such tumors more
responsive to therapy and reduce their aggressiveness and metastatic capacity.

and urothelium. The DeltaN-p63 isoforms of p63, which are believed to behave as
oncogenes, are expressed in squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and
transitional cell carcinoma. Only a few authors have looked for p63 expression in
thymomas and normal thymus. We, therefore, thought of undergoing such a search by
taking advantage of our archival material. We studied 66 cases of thymoma (1 type
A, 8 type AB, 12 type B1, 19 type B2, 12 type B3, and 14 type C/thymic carcinoma)
and 10 specimens of normal human thymus arranged in tissue microarrays. All
thymomas (including thymic carcinomas) were positive for p63 regardless of type. 
Most of the epithelial cells of the normal thymus were also positive for this
marker.

GDF15 is a transcriptional target gene for p53 and its family members, p63 and
p73. Its promoter region contains two p53-type response elements, RE1 and RE2,
and RE2 confers p53-specific transactivation. RE2 contains several mismatches
from the canonical p53 response element (RRRCWWGYYY). Two mismatches in the RRR
span and T base of the RE2 core sequence in the most 3' quarter-site are critical
for inhibiting the binding affinity to p63 and p73 and corresponding promoter
activity. Our results strongly suggest that differential DNA-binding affinities
between p53 family member proteins act, at least in part, to confer specific
target gene activation.

The epidermis is a multilayered stratified epithelium, continuously regenerated
by differentiating keratinocytes, that requires the transcription factor p63 for 
its development and maintenance. The TP63 gene encodes two major protein
isoforms, TAp63 and DeltaNp63, which have both transactivating and
transcriptional repressing activities and regulate a wide range of target genes. 
TAp63 shows clear pro-apoptotic activity, mediated both by death receptors (CD95,
TNF, TRAIL) and mitochondrial (bax, puma) pathways. Conversely, DeltaNp63
protects from apoptosis by directly competing for TAp63 target promoters or
sequestering it, forming inactive tetramers. Accordingly, p63 is expressed in
epithelial tumors, contributing to both tumorigenesis and chemoresistance.
However, the predominant physiological role of p63 is in epithelial development, 
as demonstrated by the lack of epidermis and other epithelia in p63-deficient
mice. The specific role of TAp63 and isoforms in epithelial development remains
mostly unclear. Nevertheless, recent work utilizing in vivo genetic
complementation of TAp63 and/or DeltaNp63 into a p63 null background has shed new
light into the specific functions of the two isoforms and allowed the in vivo
validation of several p63 transcriptional targets, originally identified by
microarray analysis in in vitro systems. However, despite concerted efforts to
address the role of p63 isoforms, several questions remain unanswered. The main
aim of this review is to critically discuss the data available in the literature 
and thoroughly analyze the models proposed.

In vivo studies, transgenic and knock-out mice have demonstrated that p63
isoforms play pivotal roles in ectodermal and epidermal development but their
respective function remains highly controversial. Since embryonic stem (ES) cells
can be differentiated into many cell types, they represent an effective tool to
recapitulate in vitro the main steps of embryonic development. We recently
reported the efficient derivation of ectodermal and epidermal cells from murine
ES cells and clarified the function of BMP-4 in the binary neuroectodermal choice
by stimulating sox-1(+) neural precursors to undergo specific apoptosis while
inducing epidermal differentiation through DeltaNp63 gene activation. DeltaNp63
is not required for ectodermal fate but enhances ES-derived ectodermal cell
proliferation and epidermal commitment. This unique cellular model should further
provide a powerful tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms controlling
normal skin development and in p63-ectodermal dysplasia human congenital
pathologies.

The p53 family member p63 has been implicated in both the development and
maintenance of stratified epithelial tissues, including the epidermis. Increasing
data support p63 function in the regenerative capacity of basal keratinocytes by 
maintaining cell proliferation. Recent studies further suggest this regulation
relies on inhibition of p53 activity. In addition, p63 appears to exert separate 
control over epidermal differentiation, which may involve control of such key
signaling molecules as IKKalpha and Notch. While studies over the past decade
have greatly expanded our knowledge of p63 function, much remains to be
understood regarding how p63 regulates epidermal homeostasis. Future efforts to
identify and validate direct p63 target genes as well as to understand the
expression and function of individual p63 isoforms will be important to further
define how p63 functions in the control of keratinocyte proliferation and
differentiation.

Development of skin appendages such as teeth, hairs and many exocrine glands, is 
regulated by inductive interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues.
At the molecular level, this interplay is mediated by conserved signaling
proteins of the Wnt, FGF, TGFbeta, hedgehog and TNF families and executed by
their downstream transcriptional regulators. p63, a transcription factor of the
p53 family, is essential for the development of epidermis and its derivatives in 
vertebrates. The genomic organization of p63 is complex leading to transcription 
of at least six different isoforms with different, possibly even opposite
functions. In humans, dominantly inherited mutations in p63 lead to a plenitude
of syndromes that are featured by ectodermal dysplasia and/or craniofacial and
limb malformations. In mice, lack of p63 causes a striking phenotype including
severely truncated limbs, and absence of stratified epithelia and skin
derivatives including teeth, hair follicles and mammary, lacrimal and salivary
glands. While the significance of p63 for the morphogenesis of skin appendages is
obvious, the molecular pathways regulated by p63 are only now emerging. This
review discusses the current knowledge on the role of p63 in skin appendage
development with emphasis on teeth and hair follicles.

One of the fundamental questions in neurobiology is how mammalian neurons survive
for an organism's lifetime in the face of normal ongoing "wear and tear" that, in
the case of neurons in the peripheral nervous system, even includes physical
damage. Elucidating the mechanisms that control neuronal survival is of
importance not only for our understanding of normal development of neuronal
circuitry, but also to devise treatments for pathological situations such as
traumatic injury, or neurodegenerative conditions. In this review, we will cover 
the emerging evidence that p63 plays an essential role in regulating neuronal
life and death decisions in the nervous system working in concert with its two
other family members, p53 and p73.

p63 plays an important role in skin and limb development. This has been clearly
demonstrated using mouse models and from studies on human patients harboring p63 
mutations. One question that remains unanswered is whether p63 is a tumor
suppressor gene or an oncogene. The complexity of the study of p63 is due to the 
existence of multiple isoforms with opposing functions. The lack of antibodies
that distinguish between these isoforms has made the ability to analyze the
expression of p63 difficult in human tumors. Many studies have found that p63 is 
overexpressed in human tumors while other studies have shown a loss of expression
of p63. Here, we review the roles of p63 in tumor development and suppression in 
mouse models and human tumors.

PURPOSE: To compare the histology, phenotype, ultrastructure and barrier function
of cultured limbal epithelial cells using two explant culture protocols.
METHODS: Epithelial cells were cultured for 16 days from limbal explants,
positioned with either the stromal side (stromal group) or the epithelial side
(epithelial group) on intact amniotic membranes. The cultured epithelium (n = 56)
was examined using light microscopy, immunohistochemistry for K3, Cx43, ABCG2 and
p63 expression, Western blot analysis of DeltaNp63alpha, transmission electron
microscopy, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) permeability assay and scanning
electron microscopy.
RESULTS: The epithelial group demonstrated a significantly higher expression of
p63-positive cells (85.7 +/- 4.2%) than the stromal group (75.3 +/- 8.9%), and
Western blots showed a stronger band of DeltaNp63alpha. K3 and ABCG2 were not
detected in either group, whereas Cx43 displayed moderate immunostaining in the
suprabasal layer. The number of cell layers, the desmosome number and the
undulation length in the epithelial group were not significantly different from
those in the stromal group. In both groups, HRP accumulated on the apical surface
of the superficial cells, and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated tightly
apposed superficial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that limbal explants positioned epithelial
side down may give rise to cultured epithelia with higher expression of p63 and
DeltaNp63alpha.

Immunohistochemical staining for p63 is useful in the diagnosis of anal squamous 
cell carcinomas.

Anal canal carcinomas account for between 1% and 2% of all gastrointestinal
carcinomas in the United States. By far, the most common carcinoma in this site
is squamous cell carcinoma, but the differential diagnosis typically includes
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinoma or carcinoid tumor. Because the first diagnostic specimen received in
the pathology laboratory is usually a small, sometimes suboptimal biopsy, the
distinction of these types of carcinoma can be difficult. However, accurate
diagnosis is imperative, because the treatment differs between squamous carcinoma
(chemoradiation) and the other types of carcinoma (surgical therapy). The p63
protein has been previously shown to be involved in epithelial proliferation and 
differentiation, and is known to be related to squamous carcinomas in many sites.
Therefore, we undertook to ascertain its usefulness in the diagnosis of squamous 
carcinomas in the anal canal. We retrieved 24 anal squamous carcinomas, 68
colorectal adenocarcinomas (including a tissue microarray), and 32 colorectal
neuroendocrine carcinomas from the archives at the University of Michigan, and
immunostained them for the p63 antigen. As a result, this immunohistochemical
stain had a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 92% for
squamous cell carcinoma once invasive carcinoma had been established. It also
stained the dysplastic epithelial cells in adjacent areas of anal intraepithelial
neoplasia. We report that the p63 immunostain is a highly specific and useful
tool in the diagnosis of carcinomas of the anal canal.

We showed previously that primary keratinocytes selected for low desmoglein 3
(Dsg3) expression levels exhibited increased colony-forming efficiency and
heightened proliferative potential relative to cells with higher Dsg3 expression 
levels, characteristics consistent with a more "stem/progenitor cell-like"
phenotype. Here, we have confirmed that Dsg3(dim) cells derived from cultured
primary human adult keratinocytes have comparability with alpha(6)(bri)/CD71(dim)
stem cells in terms of colony-forming efficiency. Moreover, these Dsg3(dim) cells
exhibit increased reconstituting ability in in vitro organotypic culture on
de-epidermalized dermis (DED); they are small, actively cycling cells, and they
express elevated levels of various p63 isoforms. In parallel, using the two
immortalized keratinocyte cell lines HaCaT and NTERT, we obtained essentially
similar though occasionally different findings. Thus, reduced colony-forming
efficiency by Dsg3(bri) cells consistently was observed in both cell lines even
though the cell cycle profile and levels of p63 isoforms in the bri and dim
populations differed between these two cell lines. Dsg3(dim) cells from both
immortalized lines produced thicker and better ordered hierarchical structural
organization of reconstituted epidermis relative to Dsg3(bri) and sorted control 
cells. Dsg3(dim) HaCaT cells also show sebocyte-like differentiation in the basal
compartment of skin reconstituted after a 4-week organotypic culture. No
differences in percentages of side population cells (also a putative marker of
stem cells) were detected between Dsg3(dim) and Dsg3(bri) populations. Taken
together our data indicate that Dsg3(dim) populations from primary human adult
keratinocytes and long-term established keratinocyte lines possess certain
stem/progenitor cell-like properties, although the side population characteristic
is not one of these features. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is
found at the end of this article.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent cells capable of
differentiating into any cell type of the body. It has long been known that the
adult stem cell niche is vital for the maintenance of adult stem cells. The
cornea at the front of the eye is covered by a stratified epithelium that is
renewed by stem cells located at its periphery in a region known as the limbus.
These so-called limbal stem cells are maintained by factors within the limbal
microenvironment, including collagen IV in basement membrane and limbal
fibroblasts in the stroma. Because this niche is very specific to the stem cells 
(rather than to the more differentiated cells) of the corneal epithelium, it was 
hypothesized that replication of these factors in vitro would result in hESC
differentiation into corneal epithelial-like cells. Indeed, here we show that
culturing of hESC on collagen IV using medium conditioned by the limbal
fibroblasts results in the loss of pluripotency and differentiation into
epithelial-like cells. Further differentiation results in the formation of
terminally differentiated epithelial-like cells not only of the cornea but also
of skin. Scanning electron microscopy shows that some differences exist between
hESC-derived and adult limbal epithelial-like cells, necessitating further
investigation using in vivo animal models of limbal stem cell deficiency. Such a 
model of hESC differentiation is useful for understanding the early events of
epithelial lineage specification and to the eventual potential application of
epithelium differentiated from hESC for clinical conditions of epithelial stem
cell loss. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of
this article.

Transcriptional profiling has identified five breast cancer subtypes, of which
the basal epithelial is most aggressive and correlates with poor prognosis. These
tumors display a high degree of cellular heterogeneity and lack established
molecular targets, such as estrogen receptor-alpha, progesterone receptor, and
Her2 overexpression, indicating a need for definitive diagnostic markers. We
present evidence that nestin, a previously described marker of regenerative cells
in diverse tissues, is expressed in the regenerative compartment of the normal
human mammary gland. Colocalization studies indicate two distinct populations of 
mammary epithelia that express nestin: one expressing cytokeratin 14 (CK14) and
DeltaN-p63 and another expressing desmin. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates 
that DeltaN-p63 and nestin are coordinately expressed during pregnancy in the
murine mammary gland. In the embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1, ectopic
DeltaN-p63-alpha disrupts retinoic acid-induced differentiation, thereby
preserving expression of nestin; however, small interfering RNA-mediated ablation
of nestin is insufficient to promote differentiation, indicating that whereas
nestin may identify cells within the regenerative compartment of the mammary
gland, it is insufficient to block differentiation and preserve replicative
capacity. Immunohistochemical analysis of basal epithelial breast tumors,
including those shown to carry BRCA1 mutations, indicates robust expression of
nestin and CK14, punctate expression of p63, and low to undetectable levels of
desmin expression. Nestin was not detected in other breast cancer subtypes,
indicating selectivity for basal epithelial breast tumors. These studies identify
nestin as a selective marker of the basal breast cancer phenotype, which displays
features of mammary progenitors.

Epidermal morphogenesis is a complex process that culminates in the formation of 
a barrier that protects the organism from environmental substances and
dehydration. p63, a transcription factor, is essential for normal epidermal
morphogenesis as demonstrated by the failure of mice lacking p63 expression to
develop an epidermis. However, since two independently generated p63(-/-) mouse
models displayed different phenotypes, the role of p63 in epidermal morphogenesis
has remained controversial. Furthermore, the tumor susceptibility phenotypes of
both p63(-/-) mouse models were strikingly different. In this review, we discuss 
these conflicting findings and provide evidence for various roles of p63 in the
epidermis under normal and pathological conditions.

Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor gene p63 are causative for
several syndromes, with ectodermal dysplasia, orofacial clefting and limb
malformations as the key characteristics. Different combinations of these
features are seen in five different syndromes, of which ectrodactyly, ectodermal 
dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome (EEC) is the most common one. Mutations
in p63 can also cause non-syndromic single malformations, such as split hand foot
malformation (SHFM4) and isolated cleft lip (NSCL). In this article we will
present an overview of diseases caused by mutations in the p63 gene and review
the known pathogenic p63 gene mutations.

Deficiency of p63, a p53-related protein, causes severe defects in epithelial
morphogenesis. Studies of p63-compromised mouse models reveal that p63 deficiency
induces cellular senescence both in cultured cells and in vivo, through
regulation p19(Arf)/p53 and p16(Ink4a)/Rb pathways. An extensive tumor study of
p63-compromised mice demonstrated that p63 deficiency does not predispose to, but
rather protects from, tumor development. These findings further implicate p63 as 
a negative regulator of the tumor suppressive mechanism of cellular senescence.

Myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland are considered to be a key to
distinguishing benign from malignant disease in fine-needle aspiration (FNA)
cytology. However, identification of these cells with Papanicolaou staining is
not easy. The identification of myoepithelial cells was investigated using p63
antibodies to carry out immunostaining of FNA specimens that had been used at the
time of Papanicolaou staining for 37 patients who yielded false-positives in FNA.
Positively-stained cells were observed in overlying cell clusters or the
background in 67.6% of the patients. There is a possibility that over-diagnosis
could have been avoided by performing p63 staining for these patients. The
controls consisted of stamp samples of fresh specimens obtained from 23 patients 
at the time of surgery for invasive carcinoma and the results of p63
immunostaining did not reveal any positive staining of tumor cells. Accordingly, 
these results indicate that there is a strong likelihood that there is no
invasive carcinoma when many p63-positive cells are observed in the tumor cell
population or the background and that p63 immunostaining has the potential to aid
in reducing false-positives at the time of FNA diagnosis of breast disease.

The aim of the present study was to correlate the presence and extent of
retraction clefting and the expression of p63 in neoplastic glands and glands
with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in needle core biopsies. We
analyzed needle core biopsies from 28 patients with PIN and 41 patients with
adenocarcinoma. Neoplastic glands and those with PIN were analyzed on high power 
field (400x) and classified in three groups according to the extent of clefting. 
Immunohistochemical staining was performed following Microwave Streptavidin
ImmunoPeroxidase (MSIP) protocol on DAKO TechMate Horizon automated
immunostainer. Periacinar retraction clefting was significantly more prominent in
prostatic carcinoma compared to PIN (p<0.0001) and nonneoplastic glands
(p<0.0001). There was no difference between normal glands and PIN regarding
clefting (p=0.8064). p63 was positive around the whole circumference in 12 out of
28 cases with PIN, and discontinuously positive in remaining 16 PIN cases
suggesting initial disruption of the basal cell layer. p63 immunostaining was
also positive in all nonneoplastic glands, and negative in all carcinomas. We
conclude that retraction clefting was associated with cancer and lack of basal
cells, but not with PIN. The relationship between clefting and p63 immunostaining
in prostatic cancer should be further analyzed.

Using tiled microarrays covering the entire human genome, we identify
approximately 5800 target sites for p63, a p53 homolog essential for stratified
epithelial development. p63 targets are enriched for genes involved in cell
adhesion, proliferation, death, and signaling pathways. The quality of the
derived DNA sequence motif for p63 targets correlates with binding strength
binding in vivo, but only a small minority of motifs in the genome is bound by
p63. Conversely, many p63 targets have motif scores expected for random genomic
regions. Thus, p63 binding in vivo is highly selective and often requires
additional factors beyond the simple protein-DNA interaction. There is a
significant, but complex, relationship between p63 target sites and
p63-responsive genes, with DeltaNp63 isoforms being linked to transcriptional
activation. Many p63 binding regions are evolutionarily conserved and/or
associated with sequence motifs for other transcription factors, suggesting that 
a substantial portion of p63 sites is biologically relevant.

The TP63 gene is a member of the TP53 gene family. In contrast with TP53, this
gene is not frequently inactivated by mutation in cancer. Initial experiments
with disrupted TP63 have allowed specifying p63 protein a role in the regulation 
of differentiation and morphogenesis in epithelial and mesenchymal tissues.
Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that p63 is also involved in oncogenesis 
through several mechanisms. Indeed, amplification of TP63 is detected in about
25% of squamous cell carcinomas of lung, head and neck and oesophagus. This
results in overexpression of a truncated form of p63 (DeltaNp63) that may
counteract growth suppression induced by full length p63 (TAp63), as well as by
the other family members, p53 and TAp73. Moreover, mice heterozygous for TP63
develop spontaneous tumours. Whereas p53 plays a major role in response to
numerous DNA-damaging agents, the involvement of p63 in this process is not well 
documented. Nevertheless, several groups recently reported that TAp63 can induce 
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells, alone or in synergy with
chemotherapeutic agents, and thus appears as a chemosensitivity factor. Overall, 
in addition to non-redundant, specific functions in differentiation and
morphogenesis, p63 appears to exert biological functions similar to those of p53 
and to take a growing place in oncogenesis and modulation of responses to
anti-cancer therapy.

p63 is a transcription factor involved in the development of ectodermal tissues, 
including limb, skin and, in general, multilayered epithelia. We identified both 
activated and repressed genes in human keratinocytes via gene expression
profiling of p63-depleted cells and validated 21 new primary targets by RT-PCR
and ChIP location analysis. The p63 isoforms differentially activate or repress
selected promoters. ChIPs in primary keratinocytes indicate that p63 targets are 
generally shared with p53, but some are p63-specific. Several growth suppressors 
are among repressed genes. The newly identified genes belong to pathways of
growth and differentiation and are regulated in HaCaT differentiation and in
stratification of human skin.

A functional enhancer of keratin14 is a direct transcriptional target of
deltaNp63.

Keratin14 (K14) is a prototypic marker of dividing basal keratinocytes where its 
gene is transcribed at high levels. Transcriptional regulation of K14 is governed
by an evolutionarily conserved functional enhancer marked by DNase 1
hypersensitive sites present upstream of the gene. This enhancer is sufficient to
confer epidermal-specific gene expression, which is mediated in part by binding
of members of activator protein-2 (AP)-2, AP-1, Ets, and Sp1 families of
transcription factors. Here we provide evidence that a keratinocyte-specific
nuclear protein identified as deltaNp63 binds to a conserved motif within this
enhancer. Interestingly, the selective expression profile of deltaNp63 in various
cell lines correlates with both the nuclear complex and the expression of K14.
Biochemical studies reveal that deltaNp63 can bind to a specific DNA sequence
present in the K14 enhancer and this binding leads to transactivation. In
addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with deltaNp63-specific
antibodies demonstrate that the enhancer is occupied by deltaNp63 in cultured
keratinocytes and in mouse skin epidermal cells in vivo. Finally, we show that
ectopic expression of either p63 isoform (deltaN or TA) can induce de novo
expression of K14. These studies provide a potential mechanism by which deltaNp63
directly governs the expression of K14 in a keratinocyte-specific manner.

Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) has recently been shown to be a highly
sensitive marker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, there is limited 
information concerning its utility as a marker for prostate carcinoma after
hormonal therapy. Our current investigation was conducted to evaluate the
expression of AMACR in patients with prostate carcinoma after hormonal therapy
and assess its diagnostic utility in combination with p63 and high molecular
weight cytokeratin (34betaE12) staining. Prostate tissues from 49 patients who
had been treated with hormonal therapy were immunohistochemically analyzed for
AMACR, 34betaE12, and p63 expression by a triple antibody cocktail stain. The
staining intensities and the percentages of positively staining tumor cells were 
recorded. The correlations between AMACR expression and metastatic status,
associated hormonal therapy regimens, and the extent of hormone therapy effect
were analyzed. All malignant acini were completely negative for both basal cell
markers (34betaE12 and p63). Tumor cells failed to demonstrate expression of
AMACR in 14 (29%) of 49 cases. In the remaining 35 cases (71%), positive
immunostaining for AMACR was noted, but with variable intensities and percentages
of cells stained. Positive staining for AMACR in benign glands was not seen in
any case. In all cases, basal cells were strongly stained by p63 in benign acini 
with a mean positive percentage of 96%. Similarly, basal cells in benign acini
displayed moderate staining intensities for 34betaE12 in 3 (7%) of 41 cases and
strong immunostaining for this marker in the remaining 38 cases (93%); the mean
percentage of positive cells was 92%. alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase expression
may be substantially diminished or entirely lost in prostate carcinoma after
hormonal therapy. This variation in AMACR expression does not correlate with the 
metastatic status, the modality of hormonal therapy, or the extent of
therapy-related effect. It is important that pathologists be aware that some
hormonally treated prostate carcinomas do not express AMACR, and that
immunostaining in such cases must be interpreted with caution. A triple cocktail 
stain using AMACR, 34betaE12, and p63 can be helpful in evaluating prostate
specimens for the presence of residual or recurrent carcinoma after hormonal
therapy for cancer.

Meiosis in the female germ line of mammals is distinguished by a prolonged arrest
in prophase of meiosis I between homologous chromosome recombination and
ovulation. How DNA damage is detected in these arrested oocytes is poorly
understood, but it is variably thought to involve p53, a central tumour
suppressor in mammals. While the function of p53 in monitoring the genome of
somatic cells is clear, a consensus for the importance of p53 for germ line
integrity has yet to emerge. Here we show that the p53 homologue p63 (refs 5, 6),
and specifically the TAp63 isoform, is constitutively expressed in female germ
cells during meiotic arrest and is essential in a process of DNA damage-induced
oocyte death not involving p53. We also show that DNA damage induces both the
phosphorylation of p63 and its binding to p53 cognate DNA sites and that these
events are linked to oocyte death. Our data support a model whereby p63 is the
primordial member of the p53 family and acts in a conserved process of monitoring
the integrity of the female germ line, whereas the functions of p53 are
restricted to vertebrate somatic cells for tumour suppression. These findings
have implications for understanding female germ line fidelity, the regulation of 
fertility and the evolution of tumour suppressor mechanisms.

p63 regulates proliferation and differentiation of developmentally mature

p63 is a multi-isoform p53 family member required for epidermal development.
Contrasting roles for p63 in either the initial commitment to the stratified
epithelial cell fate or in stem cell-based self-renewal have been proposed. To
investigate p63 function in a post-developmental context, we used siRNAs directed
against p63 to down-regulate p63 expression in regenerating human epidermis. Loss
of p63 resulted in severe tissue hypoplasia and inhibited both stratification and
differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner. Although p63-deficient cells
exhibited hypoproliferation, differentiation defects were not due to tissue
hypoplasia. Simultaneous p63 and p53 knockdown rescued the cell proliferation
defect of p63 knockdown alone but failed to restore differentiation, suggesting
that defects in epidermal proliferation and differentiation are mediated via
p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. Furthermore, DeltaNp63
isoforms are the main mediators of p63 effects, although TAp63 isoforms may
contribute to late differentiation. These data indicate that p63 is required for 
both the proliferative and differentiation potential of developmentally mature
keratinocytes.

fungoides.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of beta-catenin contributes to the onset of a
variety of tumours. There are many tumours that display beta-catenin accumulation
in the absence of mutations in its gene. Recently, abnormal accumulation of
wild-type beta-catenin has been associated with mutational inactivation of the
p53 tumour suppressor.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential role of p53 and its homologue p63 in
beta-catenin deregulation and to correlate this with disease outcome.
METHODS: We analysed a panel of 24 samples of mycosis fungoides (MF), the most
frequent manifestation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), for beta-catenin, p53
and p63 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Based on the immunostaining
results for beta-catenin protein, 11 positive cases were selected for laser
microdissection, genomic DNA isolation and subsequent mutation analysis of
beta-catenin exon 3 and p53 exons 4-8.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed overexpression of beta-catenin, p53 and p63 in
46%, 38% and 17% of cases, respectively. The number of p53-positive cases of MF
was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the beta-catenin-positive group (73%).
Sequence analysis demonstrated that wild-type beta-catenin accumulation in MF is 
not associated with mutational inactivation of the p53 gene and, more
importantly, our data provide evidence that a common polymorphic form of p53
(Arg72Pro) is significantly associated with beta-catenin overexpression (P <
0.05). No significant differences in the three genotypes were observed between
the CTCL cases and the control group, demonstrating that Arg72Pro polymorphism of
the p53 gene is not associated with the risk of developing cutaneous lymphomas (P
> 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We found an association of beta-catenin and p53 overexpression
without detection of structural alteration in the genes, suggesting that p53
mutation is not an important mechanism for beta-catenin activation in primary
CTCL. Additionally, we speculate that the p53 codon 72 polymorphism may influence
negative feedback control involving beta-catenin and p53.

The activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is controlled by a balance
between E3-ligase mediated p53 protein degradation and protein kinase-mediated
assembly of p53:p300 transcription machinery. Genetic studies in mice have shown 
that mutation of the CK2 phospho-acceptor site in p53 increases UV-induced skin
cancer formation,(11) highlighting an unexpected role for p53 phosphorylation in 
mediating p53-dependent tumor suppression. However, it is not known in which cell
types CK2-mediated phosphorylation of p53 occurs. Using human skin as a model to 
determine whether there is cell-selectivity in modulating p53 phosphorylation, we
have found a selective induction of p53 phosphorylation at the CK2-site in the
basal cells of UV irradiated human skin. Dual-immunofluorescence also revealed
that Ser392 and Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 also occur in the same basal cells, 
although often within distinct regions of the nucleus. Given that p63alphaDeltaN 
is required for p53 activation after DNA damage, we examined and found a high
proportion of cells co-express p63alphaDeltaN and CK2-phosphorylated p53 after
UV-irradiation. As controls, the proliferation marker Ki67 and p63alphaDeltaN
generally exhibit mutually exclusive expression. These data identify a
physiological model with which to identify signaling pathways that mediate
cross-talk between p63alphaDeltaN and activating p53 kinase pathways after DNA
damage in basal cell populations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of using an AMACR/34betaE12/p63 cocktail and 
double-staining for the diagnosis of small focal protatic carcinoma and
precarcinomatous lesions.
METHODS: A total of 130 consecutive cases were examined over a 3-month period,
including 105 prostate needle biopsy samples, 6 radical prostatectomy specimens
and 19 benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens which were excised transurethra or 
above pubis. 262 paraffin blocks of all the 1030 ones were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and by immunostains for AMACR, 34betaE12, p63, and an
antibody cocktail comprising all the three with double-chromogen reaction. The
diagnoses were then made according to the immunostaining, HE staining and
clinical information.
RESULTS: In the sections stained by the 3-antibody cocktail, blue-black
cytoplasmic staining was observed in the epithelial cells of prostatic carcinoma 
and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) the basal cells of
benign glands were stained red. There were no red basal cells around the
blue-black glandular epithelium of carcinoma, but discontinuous or consecutive
red basal cells were present around the blue-black glandular epithelium of HGPIN.
Prostatic carcinoma was found in 214 paraffin blocks (82%), including 31 small
focal carcinoma. HGPIN were observed in 64 paraffin blocks (24%), including focal
HGPIN and small gland alveolus HGPIN. AAH was found in one block. No benign
glands were simultaneously positive for AMACR and negative for basal cell
markers.
CONCLUSION: Inmmunohistochemistry studies using a 3-antibody cocktail and double 
staining can improve the detection rate of small focal prostatic carcinoma and
HGPIN.

ADULT (Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth) syndrome is characterized by
ectrodactyly, syndactyly, fingernail and toenail dysplasia, hypoplasia of the
breast and nipple, excessive freckling, lacrimal duct atresia, frontal alopecia, 
primary hypodontia, and/or early loss of permanent teeth. It is a rare autosomal 
dominant disorder which has been linked to mutation in the p63 gene. The p63 gene
has been described in five overlapping limb malformation syndromes including the 
EEC syndrome (ectodermal ectrodactyly clefting). We report on the first case of
ADULT syndrome of a mother and daughter with a new mutation R227Q in exon 6 of
the p63 gene. This has not been previously associated with ADULT syndrome but
only seen in EEC. In addition to the previously reported features of ADULT
syndrome this report also describes some additional findings including
hyperextensibility at the distal interphalageal joints, bilateral thumb
duplication, bifid toenails, symptoms of urinary retention, vesicoureteric
reflux, prominent ears, conductive hearing loss, and an overgrowth of a patch of 
hair in the midline of the neck. This report expands the knowledge of
genotype-phenotype data on the p63 gene and suggests there may be a considerable 
overlap between the EEC syndrome and the ADULT syndrome.

p63 is a developmentally regulated transcription factor related to p53. It is
involved in the development of ectodermal tissues, including limb, skin and in
general, multilayered epithelia. The DeltaNp63alpha isoform is thought to play a 
'master' role in the asymmetric division of epithelial cells. It is also involved
in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, phenotypically characterized by
ectodermal dysplasia. Our understanding of transcriptional networks controlled by
p63 is limited, owing to the low number of bona fide targets. To screen for new
targets, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation from keratinocytes (KCs)
coupled to the microarray technology, using both CpG islands and promoter arrays.
The former revealed 96 loci, the latter yielded 85 additional genes. We tested 40
of these targets in several functional assays, including: (i) in vivo binding by 
p63 in primary KCs; (ii) expression analysis in differentiating HaCaT cells and
in cells overexpressing DeltaNp63alpha; (iii) promoter transactivation and (iv)
immunostaining in normal tissues, confirming their regulation by p63. We
discovered several new specific targets whose functional categorization links p63
to cell growth and differentiation.

Tumor-specific p73 up-regulation mediates p63 dependence in squamous cell
carcinoma.

p63 is essential for normal epithelial development and is overexpressed in the
vast majority of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Recent work had shown that
DeltaNp63alpha is essential for survival of SCC cells, raising the possibility
that the p63 pathway may be an attractive therapeutic target in these tumors.
Nevertheless, it is unknown whether a therapeutic window exists for inhibiting
p63 in tumor cells versus normal epithelia. Here, we show that SCC cells are
uniquely dependent on DeltaNp63alpha for survival, unlike normal p63-expressing
epithelial cells, and that dependence is mediated through tumor-specific
up-regulation of the related protein p73. In normal primary human keratinocytes, 
we find that inhibition of endogenous p63 by RNA interference (RNAi) induces
p21(CIP1) expression, inhibits cell cycle progression, and ultimately promotes
cellular senescence. In contrast, p63 inhibition in SCC cells induces
proapoptotic bcl-2 family members and rapidly triggers apoptosis. Expression of
p73 is low in uncultured basal keratinocytes but is markedly up-regulated in both
SCC cell lines and primary tumors in vivo. Whereas p21(CIP1) induction following 
loss of p63 in normal cells is independent of p53 and p73, both proapoptotic gene
induction and cell death following p63 RNAi in tumor cells are p73 dependent.
Finally, ectopic p73 expression in primary keratinocytes does not affect baseline
cell proliferation but is sufficient to trigger cell death following loss of p63.
Together, these findings define a specific molecular mechanism of p63 dependence 
through p73 up-regulation, and they provide a rationale for targeting the p63
pathway as a therapeutic strategy in SCCs.

We report the case of a young boy with fine hair, mild nail dysplasia, blocked
nasolacrimal ducts, absence of central incisors, bilateral oligodactyly of feet
and anal stenosis. His father showed the same spectrum of anomalies with mild
expression. He had mild nail dysplasia, blocked nasolacrimal ducts, inferior
dental cysts with consequent premature tooth loss, frequent dental decays
consequent to enamel abnormality and cutaneous syndactyly of the second and third
right toe. The acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome was suspected and
molecular analysis of the P63 gene was performed, but no mutation was found.
Although P63 gene analysis was negative, we think that both cases show clinical
overlap with the acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome and confirm the wide
expression of this condition, even in the same family.

The basal phenotype of breast carcinoma was demonstrated from a study of gene
expression profiles, which demonstrated five carcinoma phenotypes with differing 
immunohistologic profiles and outcomes. The basal phenotype, so-named because of 
an immunohistologic profile that is similar to myoepithelial cells of the breast,
has poor outcomes. While the invasive basal phenotype has been described, there
is a paucity of literature regarding the existence or recognition of a precursor 
lesion. We searched our CoPath database for breast carcinomas in the age group of
37 years or less, and this yielded 98 cases from the years 2001 to April 2006.
Pathology reports were screened for those cases that were negative for estrogen
and progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu (triple negative). A total of 16 cases
(16/98, 16%) fulfilled these criteria. Histology was reviewed and immunostains
were performed for Cytokeratins 14, 17, and 5/6, vimentin, EGFR, c-kit, smooth
muscle actin and p63. All 16 cases had a high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma,
Nottingham score 9/9, with geographic necrosis, good circumscription and lymphoid
infiltrates. Of the 16 cases, 13 exhibited at least one area of ductal carcinoma 
in situ (DCIS). The DCIS types were solid, flat or micropapillary, high nuclear
grade, with comedonecrosis and invariably associated with intense lymphoid
inflammatory cell infiltration. Of 16 invasive cases, 14 (88%) were positive for 
CK14, CK17, CK5/6 and EGFR; 94% were vimentin positive, while half or less of
cases were positive for smooth muscle actin, c-kit or p63. All of the DCIS
components demonstrated the same immunohistologic profile as the invasive
component. A DCIS component of solid, flat or micropapillary type exists in the
basal phenotype of breast carcinoma, and it demonstrates the same immunophenotype
as the invasive carcinoma, typically positive for CK5/6, CK14, CK17, vimentin and
EGFR, but negative for ER/PR and HER-2/neu.

Myoepithelioma of breast are extremely rare. We report two cases of pure
malignant myoepithelioma of the breast, utilising light microscopic and
immunohistochemical methods for diagnosis. Both the cases presented as breast
lump. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained microscopic sections revealed a
predominantly spindle cell tumor. Immunohistochemical work up was done. Case
number one expressed positivity for vimentin, Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA), S-100
and CD10. Case number two expressed positivity for Vimentin, CD10 and p63. This
led to the diagnoses of malignant myoepithelioma in both of them. Documentation
of such cases prospectively and from archival material, using
immunohistochemistry, is of extreme importance to assess the prevalence, various 
phenotypic patterns, long-term biological behaviour and to establish management
protocols for malignant myoepithelioma.

The p53 family of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in the control of
the cellular response to DNA damaging agents. In addition to pro-apoptotic
molecules such as p53, TAp73 and TAp63, this gene family also encodes for the
anti-apoptotic molecules deltaNp73, deltaNp63, deltaNp53, and p53 mutants are
often found in tumor cells, that have the role to limit and to modulate the
pro-apoptotic side of the family. The ratio between the different members of the 
family is critical to make the life or death decision following DNA damage and is
tightly regulated by post-translational and transcriptional mechanisms. In this
study we have uncovered a novel positive feedback that involves the
transcriptional activation of the anti-apoptotic molecule deltaNp63 by the
anti-apoptotic molecules deltaNp73 and mutant p53, and that is put into motion
upon treatment with a subset of DNA damaging agents such as Doxorubicin and 5-FU.
DeltaNp73 and mutant p53 associate with the deltaNp63 promoter inducing its
transcription and this is enhanced by doxorubicin treatment. Furthermore we have 
observed that deltaNp73- and mutp53-mediated activation of the deltaNp63 promoter
requires the functionality of the proximal CCAAT boxes of this promoter, being
hampered by mutation of CCAAT boxes or by dominant negative NFYA expression. This
mechanism may serve as an additional control of the response of a normal cell to 
DNA damage or as an anti-apoptotic barrier of cancer cells subjected to DNA
damage.

A member of the family of p53-related genes, p63 plays a role in regulating
epithelial proliferation and differentiation programs, but the pathological and
clinical meaning of p63 in B-cell lymphoma has not been elucidated. We
investigated the expression pattern of p63 in B-cell malignancies, and evaluated 
the correlation between the expression of p63 and other germinal center markers. 
Ninety-eight B-cell lymphomas (28 FCL, 5 MCL, and 65 DLBCL) were analyzed by
immunohistochemical examination for p63, bcl-6, CD10 and MUM-1 proteins, and for 
rearrangement of bcl-2/IgH. Expression of p63 was observed in the nuclei of tumor
cells obtained from 15 of 28 (54%) FCL, 22 of 65 (34%) DLBCL, but none of 5 MCL. 
In DLBCL, the expression of p63 and bcl-6 showed a significant correlation (P <
0.02), but no correlation was observed between p63 and expression of CD10, MUM-1,
or bcl-2/IgH rearrangement. RT-PCR revealed that TAp63alpha-type transcripts, a
possible negative regulator of transcriptional activation of p21 promoter, were
major transcripts in B-cell lymphoma tissues. As for prognostic significance,
only patients in the p63 positive group of FCL died, and in the non-germinal
center group, the p63 positive cases appeared to have inferior overall survival
than other groups in DLBCL. Our preliminary results suggested that p63 expression
is a disadvantageous factor for prognosis in this subgroup of B-cell lymphomas.

BACKGROUND: Current ancillary markers for diagnosis in prostate biopsies include 
p63 and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). Annexin II (ANXII), a calcium and 
phospholipid binding protein, is lost in prostate cancer.
AIMS: To investigate ANXII expression in order to assess its utility as a novel
diagnostic marker in comparison to p63 and AMACR.
METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry on six tissue microarrays, ANXII, p63, and
AMACR expression was analysed from 210 radical prostatectomy cases. Staining was 
evaluated in benign and atrophic glands, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (HGPIN), and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Separate scores were given for
ANXII, AMACR and p63 expression.
RESULTS: Diffuse cytoplasmic expression of ANXII correlated with p63 reactivity
in basal cells. Benign glands were positive for ANXII in 286/292 cores (98%) and 
negative for AMACR in all 292 cores. HGPIN showed heterogeneous expression of
AMACR and ANXII. A significantly larger proportion of HGPIN glands were correctly
identified as ANXII negative than as positive for AMACR. ANXII loss in prostate
cancer was found in 282/320 cores (88%) and correlated with positive AMACR
expression (272/320 cores, 85%), which was not statistically significant. There
was no statistically significant correlation between ANXII scores and the
clinical parameters examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical staining for ANXII is a consistent and reliable 
marker of prostatic neoplasia. The findings of this study suggest the potential
utility of ANXII as a diagnostic aid in prostate cancer histopathology.

p63, a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, is critical for the development and
maintenance of squamous epithelia. p63 is specifically expressed in the basal
layers of stratified epithelial tissues and is considered a specific marker for
cells of this type. The role of p63 in tumorigenesis remains poorly defined.
Numerous studies have highlighted the oncogenic potential of the predominant p63 
isoform DeltaNp63alpha; however, data suggest that other p63 proteins can act as 
tumor suppressors or alter the metastatic potential of tumors. DeltaNp63alpha can
act as a transcriptional repressor, but the link between the transcriptional
functions of p63 and its biological role is still unclear. In this study, we used
a loss-of-function approach to investigate the transcriptional programs
controlled by p63. Disruption of p63 in squamous cell lines resulted in
down-regulation of transcripts specifically expressed in squamous tissues and a
significant alteration of keratinocyte differentiation. Interestingly, we found
that disruption of p63 led to up-regulation of markers of nonepithelial tissues
(mesenchyme and neural tissue) in both primary and immortalized squamous cells.
Many of these up-regulated genes are associated with increased capacity for
invasion and metastasis in tumors. Furthermore, loss of p63 expression was
accompanied by a shift toward mesenchymal morphology and an increase in motility 
in primary keratinocytes and squamous cell lines. We conclude that loss of
endogenous p63 expression results in up-regulation of genes associated with
invasion and metastasis, and predisposes to a loss of epithelial and acquisition 
of mesenchymal characteristics. These findings have implications for the role of 
p63 in both development and tumorigenesis.

p63 is a member of the p53 family of proteins and plays an important role in
epithelial development and differentiation. Although some p63 binding sites in
the regulatory elements of epithelial genes have been identified, the optimal
DNA-binding sequence has not been ascertained for this transcription factor.
Here, we identify the preferred DNA-binding site of p63 by performing in vitro
DNA selection experiments. Our analysis shows that the optimal p63 DNA-binding
consensus motif consists of a CA(T)TG core and an AT-rich 5' and 3' flanking
sequence. Gel shift and competition experiments demonstrate that there are
specific sequence requirements that confer high DNA-binding affinity for p63 and 
that significant deviation from the consensus sequences result in poor or no
binding. This pattern of DNA-binding is similar for both recombinant p63 and the 
endogenous protein present in keratinocyte nuclear extracts. Furthermore, we show
that the consensus sequence is distinctly different from that of p53,
particularly in the flanking sequences. Identification of the p63 consensus
DNA-binding sequence will facilitate the validation of in vivo p63-responsive
elements that mediate transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of target
genes.

p63, a protein related to the tumor suppressor p53, is a transcription factor
that plays an important role in epidermal differentiation and limb development.
The gene has two distinct promoters that allow the formation of proteins that
either contain (TA) or lack (DeltaN) a transactivation domain. In addition,
alternative splicing at the 3' end generates proteins with different C-termini,
denoted alpha, beta and gamma for a total of six isoforms. DeltaNp63alpha isoform
is the main isoform expressed at all stages of development, however the relative 
contribution of individual p63 isoform during ectodermal differentiation and
organogenesis is still far from understood. Overexpression of DeltaNp63 led to
increased growth of transformed cells in vitro and in vivo while treatment of
keratinocytes with ultraviolet irradiation causes downregulation of DeltaNp63
proteins and their corresponding mRNA. The p63 gene locus is often amplified in
squamous cell carcinomas while alterations in the relative levels of TA and
DeltaNp63 correlate with prognosis in several human cancers suggesting that fine 
regulation of p63 intracellular levels must be of pivotal importance in
controlling cell proliferation, death and differentiation. Despite its relevance 
little is known on the mechanisms controlling p63 protein levels. Here we show
that Itch/AIP4, a HECT E3-ubiquitin ligase, promotes p63 degradation. Using a set
of p63 deletion mutants, we have identified a region and two critical lysine
residues of p63, associated to human Split-Hand and Foot Malformation-4 (SHFM-4) 
syndrome, which are involved in the mechanism of Itch-mediated p63 degradation.

BACKGROUND: p51 (p73L/p63/p40/KET), a recently isolated novel p53 homologue,
binds to p53-responsive elements to upregulate some p53 target genes and has been
suggested to share partially overlapping functions with p53. p51 may be a
promising candidate target molecule for anti-cancer therapy.
METHODS: In this study, we adenovirally transduced p51A cDNA into human lung,
gastric and pancreatic cancer cells and analyzed the intracellular function of
p51 in anti-oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Overexpression of p51A revealed an anti-proliferative effect in vitro in
all the cancer cells examined in this study. The anchorage-dependent and
-independent cell growth of EBC1 cells carrying mutations in both p51 and p53 was
suppressed and significant apoptosis following adenoviral transduction with p51
and/or p53 was seen. This growth suppression was cooperatively enhanced by the
combined infection with adenoviral vectors encoding both p51 and p53.
Furthermore, p51 activated several, but not all, p53-inducible genes, indicating 
that the mechanisms controlling p51- and p53-mediated tumor suppression differed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that, although p51 exhibited reduced
anti-oncogenetic effects compared with p53, it cooperatively enhanced the
anti-tumor effects of p53. Our results suggest that p51 functions as a tumor
suppressor in human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and may be useful as a
potential tool for cancer gene therapy.

The p53 family proteins are transcription factors and have both common and
distinct functions. p53 is a classic tumor suppressor, whereas p63 and p73 have
fundamental functions in development. To gain an insight into the functional
diversities among the p53 family, target genes specifically regulated by p63 and 
p73 were examined. Here, we found that the GLX2 gene, which encodes glyoxalase II
enzyme, is up-regulated by p63 and p73. Accordingly, a specific responsive
element was found in intron 1 of the GLX2 gene, which can be activated and bound 
by p63 and p73. We also found that, upon overexpression, the cytosolic, but not
the mitochondrial, GLX2 inhibits the apoptotic response of a cell to
methylglyoxal, a by-product of glycolysis. Likewise, we showed that cells
deficient in GLX2 are hypersensitive to methylglyoxal-induced apoptosis.
Interestingly, a deficiency in GLX2 also enhances the susceptibility of a cell to
DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These observations reveal
a novel link between the p53 family and the glyoxalase system. Given that
methylglyoxal is frequently generated under both physiological and pathological
conditions, we postulate that GLX2 serves as a pro-survival factor of the p53
family and plays a critical role in the normal development and in the
pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: p53 is mutated in about 50% of various malignant diseases including
lung cancer. The p53 family consists of p53, p73 and p63. Although
transactivating protein isoforms display p53-like functions, the deltaNp73 or
deltaNp63 isoforms act toward p53 in a dominantly negative way. The aim of this
study was to detect p53, deltaNp73 and deltaNp63 expressions in lung cancer and
to evaluate the relationship between the expression levels of the proteins and
the prognosis of patients with resectable lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was employed to analyze the protein
expression of p53, deltaNp73 and deltaNp63 in paraffin-embedded tumor samples
from 132 well-characterized lung cancer patients. The correlation among the
expression levels of p53, deltaNp73 and deltaNp63, clinical variables and
survival outcome was analyzed.
RESULTS: Positive expressions of p53, deltaNp73 and deltaNp63 were detected in
the tumor cells in 52, 77 and 44 of the 132 patients, respectively (39.4%, 58.3% 
and 33.3%) with lung cancer. The incidence of p53 positive expression was 54.5%
and 27.6% in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma,
respectively (p = 0.03). The incidence of a positive expression of deltaNp73 was 
64.5% and 43.6% in male and female patients, respectively (p = 0.03). The
incidence of deltaNp63 positive expression was 68.2% and 15.8% in the patients
with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, respectively (p < 0.0001). The
expressions of p53 and deltaNp63 were not found to significantly affect survival.
However, lung cancer patients with a positive deltaNp73 expression had a poorer
prognosis than those with a negative deltaNp73 expression. In addition,
multivariate analysis indicated that a positive expression of deltaNp73 was a
significantly independent factor for predicting a poor prognosis (p < 0.0001,
risk ratio = 3.38).
CONCLUSION: Clinical evidence that the p53 family is frequently overexpressed in 
lung cancer specimens, especially deltaNp63 in squamous cell carcinoma, was
provided. The expression of deltaNp73 may be a useful marker for predicting a
poor prognosis in resectable lung cancer. Understanding how groups of lung cancer
cell genes are coordinately expressed in response to physiological, immunological
and micro-environmental stimuli remains an important goal. A better understanding
of the gene expression profiles of tumors may help to identify molecular targets,
such as deltaNp73, for effective therapy.

PURPOSE: To investigate the significance of p63 expression in uterine cervical
and endometrial cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DeltaNp63 protein expression was studied in a variety of
127 cases of uterine cervical lesions (20 non-neoplastic cervices, 43 cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN], 54 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 40
adenocarcinomas, and 13 other histologic types) and 30 endometrioid type of
endometrial adenocarcinomas by using immunohistochemistry. One SCC cell line
(ME-180) and one adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa) were also included.
RESULTS: In uterine cervix, the expression of DeltaNp63 was increased with
progression of CIN, and positive in all SCCs, transitional cell carcinomas, and
adenoid basal carcinoma, but negative in all adenocarcinomas. Adenosquamous cell 
carcinoma and mixed neuroendocrine and squamous cell carcinoma were positive in
squamous component, but not in adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma
components. ME-180 cell line was positive, whereas HeLa cell line was negative.
Endometrioid type of endometrial adenocarcinomas showed a positive staining in
glandular (26.7%) and squamous component.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical staining for DeltaNp63 is a powerful marker for 
squamous differentiation and useful in exclusion of glandular and neuroendocrine 
differentiation in uterine cervical cancers, but not always in endometrial
cancers.

Corneal diseases are some of the most prevalent causes of blindness worldwide.
While the most common treatment for corneal blindness is the transplantation of
cadaver corneas, expanded limbal stem cells are finding recent application.
Unknown, however, is the identity of the actual repopulating stem cell fraction
utilized in both treatments and the critical factors governing successful
engraftment and repopulation. In order to localize potential stem cell
populations in vivo, we have immunohistochemically mapped a battery of candidate 
stem and progenitor cell markers including c-Kit and other growth factor
receptors, nuclear markers including DeltaNp63, as well as adhesion factors
across the cornea and distal sclera. Cell populations that differentially and
specifically stained for some of these markers include the basal and superficial 
limbal/conjunctival epithelium and scattered cells within the substantia propria 
of the bulbar conjunctiva. We have also determined that the culture of
differentiated cornea epithelial cells as dissociated and explant cultures
induces the expression of several markers previously characterized as candidate
limbal stem cell markers. This study provides a foundation to explore candidate
corneal stem cell populations. As well, we show that expression of traditional
stem cell markers may not be reliable indicator of stem cell content during
limbal stem cell expansion in vitro and could contribute to the variable success 
rates of corneal stem cell transplantation.

Split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM), or ectrodactyly, is characterized by
underdeveloped or absent central digital rays, clefts of the hands and feet, and 
variable syndactyly of the remaining digits. SHFM occurs as both an isolated
finding and a component of many syndromes. SHFM is a heterogeneous condition
caused by multiple loci, including SHFM1 (chromosome region 7q21-q22), SHFM2
(Xq26), SHFM3 (10q24), SHFM4 (3q27), and SHFM5 (2q31). Mutations in TP63 at the
SHFM4 locus are known to underlie both syndromic and non-syndromic forms SHFM,
but the causes of most non-syndromic SHFM cases remain unknown. The recent
identification of submicroscopic tandem chromosome duplications affecting the
SHFM3 locus in seven families with non-syndromic SHFM has helped to further
unravel the molecular basis of this malformation. In our ongoing studies of the
SHFM3 locus in 44 additional cases of syndromic and non-syndromic SHFM, we have
identified similar chromosome rearrangements in eight additional cases (18%),
using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We have also utilized real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) to test for the duplications. Seven of the cases with
rearrangements were non-syndromic. The current findings bring the total of
SHFM3-associated cases with chromosome rearrangements to 15, which constitute 29%
(15 of 51) of the cases screened to date. This includes 9 of 9 cases (100%) with 
known linkage to the SHFM3 locus, all of whom have non-syndromic SHFM, and 6 of
42 additional cases (14%), four of whom have non-syndromic SHFM. Thus, SHFM3
abnormalities underlie a substantial proportion of SHFM cases and appear to be a 
more frequent cause of non-syndromic SHFM than mutations in TP63.

A mutation of the p63 gene in non-syndromic cleft lip.

Leoyklang P, Siriwan P, Shotelersuk V.

Mutations in the p63 gene (TP63) underlie several monogenic malformation
syndromes manifesting cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). We
investigated whether p63 mutations also result in non-syndromic CL/P.
Specifically, we performed mutation analysis of the 16 exons of the p63 gene for 
100 Thai patients with non-syndromic CL/P. In total, 21 variant sites were
identified. All were single nucleotide changes, with six in coding regions,
including three novel non-synonymous changes: S90L, R313G, and D564H. The R313G
was concluded to be pathogenic on the basis of its amino acid change,
evolutionary conservation, its occurrence in a functionally important domain, its
predicted damaging function, its de novo occurrence, and its absence in 500
control individuals. Our data strongly suggest, for the first time, a causative
role of a heterozygous mutation in the p63 gene in non-syndromic CL/P,
highlighting the wide phenotypic spectrum of p63 gene mutations.

p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. It is now known that the
p53 family proteins p63 and p73 play important roles in tumor suppression as well
as in development. Because p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancer,
understanding the signaling pathways that activate p63 and p73 will not only shed
light on the developmental processes regulated by p63 and p73 but may also yield 
insight into ways to harness p63 and p73 activity for cancer therapy. Recent
research has shown that an alternative splice form of c-H-ras, called p19ras, is 
a positive regulator of p73beta through a mechanism that involves the E3
ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Implications for this previously unidentified means of
regulation are discussed in light of tumor suppression and are extended to p53
and p63.

PURPOSE: To explore the in vitro proliferative potential of human limbal
epithelial cells after 31 degrees C organ-culture storage and to investigate
putative factors influencing it.
METHODS: 185 cultures of limbal explants were carried-out either from
full-thickness explants (n = 102) or from enzymatically dissociated cells (n =
83) seeded on a feeder layer of human keratocytes. Epithelial outgrowth was
assessed by phase contrast microscopy using a computerized image analysis
software. Cell phenotype was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and
immunocytology. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to determine 
factors influencing epithelial growth in culture.
RESULTS: An epithelial outgrowth of 100 square mm or more was observed in 52% of 
cultures, (average growth area: 440 +/- 256 mm at three weeks). Corneal
epithelial phenotype was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, and
cytokeratin pattern. Cytokeratine 19, deltaNp63, nestin and vimentin positive
staining revealed undifferentiated epithelial cells in both explant and cell
suspension cultures at three weeks. Short death to cornea retrieval time (p <
0.03) and female donors (p < 0.01) were associated with higher cell growth.
Enzymatic treatment of explants by trypsin, but not dispase, decreased cell
proliferation at two (p < 0.03) and three weeks (p < 0.04). Donor age, duration
of corneal storage, and source of the explant did not influence the cell growth.
CONCLUSION: Organ-culture conditions can preserve limbal cell mitotic potential
if limbal tissue is excised early after circulatory arrest. Human keratocytes can
be used as a feeder layer allowing epithelial cells to maintain poorly
differentiated phenotype in culture. Further investigations are needed to explain
the influence of the donor sex on epithelial cell growth in culture.

BACKGROUND: Histological differentiation of mammary papillary lesions can be
difficult. The evaluation of myoepithelial cells can be helpful, with benign
papilloma showing a continuous myoepithelial cell layer, which becomes attenuated
or absent in malignant papillary lesions.
METHODS: A large series of 100 papillomas (28 papillomas with florid epithelial
hyperplasia) and 68 papillary carcinomas (9 invasive, 44 in situ, and 15 ductal
carcinomas in situ (DCIS) involving papillomas) of the breast were stained for
myoepithelial cells by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to smooth-muscle
actin (SMA), p63, CD10 and cytokeratin (CK) 14.
RESULTS: In the papillomas, using these four antibodies, myoepithelial cells were
positive in 88%, 99%, 91% and 95% of cases, respectively, with SMA showing marked
stromal component cell staining and CD10 showing epithelial and stromal staining.
CK14 also showed epithelial staining in 71% of papillomas and 96% of papillomas
with florid epithelial hyperplasia. In the papillary carcinomas, 36 (53%) cases
showed staining of myoepithelial cells that were scattered, discontinuous and
diminished in number and the remaining 32 (47%) cases did not show myoepithelial 
cells. Invasive papillary carcinoma has the lowest proportion (33%) with
myoepithelial cells, and DCIS involving papillomas had the highest proportion
(87%).
CONCLUSIONS: p63 had the highest sensitivity and did not cross-react with stromal
cells and only rarely with epithelial cells. CK14 has the added ability to
distinguish between florid epithelial hyperplasia involving papilloma and DCIS
involving papillomas. CK14 and p63 may be used as an adjunct in assessing
difficult papillary lesions of the breast.

Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM, also called ectrodactyly) is a
clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous group of limb malformations.
Several SHFM loci have been mapped, including SHFM1 (7q21), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3
(10q24), SHFM4 (3q27) and SHFM5 (2q31). To date, mutations in a gene (TP63) have 
only been identified for SHFM4. SHFM3 has been shown by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis to be caused by an approximately 500 kb DNA rearrangement at
10q24. This region contains a number of candidate genes for SHFM3, though which
gene(s) is (are) involved in the pathogenesis of SHFM3 is not known. Our aim in
this study was to improve the diagnosis of SHFM3, and to begin to understand
which genes are involved in SHFM3. Here we show, using two different techniques, 
FISH and quantitative PCR that SHFM3 is caused by a minimal 325 kb duplication
containing only two genes (BTRC and POLL). The data presented provide improved
methods for diagnosis and begin to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of SHFM3.
Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes within and flanking the duplicated
region shows that BTRC (present in three copies) and SUFU (present in two copies)
are overexpressed in SHFM3 patients compared to controls. Our data suggest that
SHFM3 may be caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which are
involved in beta-catenin signalling.

Split hand foot malformation (SHFM) also known as central ray deficiency,
ectrodactyly and cleft hand/foot, is one of the most complex of limb
malformations. SHFM can occur as an isolated malformation or in association with 
other malformations, as in the ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (EEC)
syndrome and other autosomal dominant conditions with long bone involvement, all 
showing variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. The deficiency in SHFM
patients can also be accompanied by other distal limb anomalies including
polydactyly and/or syndactyly. This variability causes the phenotypic
classification of SHFM to be far from straightforward and genetic heterogeneity, 
with at least five loci identified to date, further complicates management of
affected patients and their families. Although genotypic-phenotypic correlations 
have been proposed at the molecular level for SHFM4 patients who have mutations
in the P63 gene, phenotypic correlations at the chromosomal level have not been
thoroughly documented. Using descriptive epidemiology, Chi square and
discriminant function analyses, our laboratory has identified phenotypic patterns
associated with the mapped genetic SHFM loci. These findings can assist in
classification, provide insight into responsible developmental genes and assist
in directing mapping efforts and targeted genetic testing, resulting in more
accurate information for family members in the clinical setting. Comparison with 
relevant animal models is discussed.

p63 and p73: life and death in squamous cell carcinoma.

The p53 family member p63 plays an essential role in the developing epithelium,
and overexpression of the DeltaNp63alpha isoform is frequently observed in human 
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). These findings have suggested that
DeltaNp63alpha might function as an oncogene within squamous epithelial cells.
Nevertheless, the mechanism by which DeltaNp63alpha might promote tumorigenesis
remains poorly understood, and data from mouse models implies that the p63 locus 
might in fact function as a tumor suppressor in these same tissues. A recent
study using RNA interference in human SCC-derived cell lines shows that
DeltaNp63alpha mediates an essential survival function in human SCC cells by
virtue of its ability to suppress the pro-apoptotic function of the related p53
family member p73. These findings support an oncogenic role for DeltaNp63alpha
and they demonstrate the existence of critical physical and functional
interactions between endogenous p53 family members in human cancer. Specific
chemotherapeutic agents and future targeted approaches may be able to exploit
this pathway to therapeutic advantage.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the disease-causing genetic alteration of
split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM) in a Chinese family.
METHODS: Three of the 5 affected individuals from a four-generation Chinese SHFM 
family were examined physically and radiologically. Peripheral blood samples were
collected from Digital photographs of the malformed hands and feet were taken.
Peripheral blood samples were collected from 2 affected individuals, and
lymphocytes were isolated to undergo high resolution G-banding. Genomic DNA was
extracted from the whole blood samples of 4 available family members, including
the 3 affected individuals. All 16 exons and their flanking intronic sequences of
the TP63 gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced 
directly. Microsatellite markers from the five SHFM loci were analyzed in the
available family members by PCR, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver
staining. For semi-quantitative determination of the allele copy number, the
polymorphic PCR-amplified fragments representing genetic markers from the SHFM3
locus at chromosome 10q24.3 were sequenced in the affected individuals using
normal individuals with identical genotypes as controls.
RESULTS: All 3 existing affected individuals showed absence of 3 radial fingers, 
2 affected individuals had a deep central cleft and central ray deficiency in the
feet, and 1 affected individual had a fibular monodactyli, all limb malformations
being bilateral and consistent with the phenotype of typical SHFM. G-banding
showed normal karyotypes in the 3 affected individuals and no visible cytogenetic
abnormality was found. Moreover, no mutation was identified in the TP63 gene.
While no haplotype sharing was observed in the markers from loci SHFM1, SHFM4 and
SHFM5, potential haplotype sharing was detected in the markers from two loci,
SHFM2 and SHFM3, indicating possible causative mutation at SHFM2 or SHFM3.
Furthermore, obviously biased silver density toward the allele fragments shared
by the 3 affected individuals was observed in the markers from the SHFM3 locus.
Comparative sequencing showed roughly one-fold increase of fluorescent signal of 
the shared fragments in the affected individuals. These results suggested a
large-scale DNA duplication within the SHFM3 locus.
CONCLUSION: A large-scale DNA duplication within the SHFM3 locus at chromosome
10q24.3 has been identified as the pathogenic genetic change in Chinese patients 
with SHFM.

Immunodetection of GLUT1, p63 and phospho-histone H1 in invasive head and neck
squamous carcinoma: correlation of immunohistochemical staining patterns with
keratinizationAims : To examine invasive head and neck squamous carcinomas for
expression of GLUT1, a glucose transporter and marker of increased glucose
uptake, glycolytic metabolism and response to tissue hypoxia; p63, a p53
homologue that is a marker of the undifferentiated proliferative basaloid
phenotype; and phospho-histone H1, a marker of activation of the cell
cycle-promoting cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2. Methods : Routinely processed
slides from 34 invasive squamous carcinomas, including 25 with intraepithelial
components, were immunostained with anti-GLUT1 (Chemicon), anti-p63 (4A4, Santa
Cruz), and antiphospho-histone H1 (monoclonal 12D11). Results : In keratinizing
carcinomas, all three markers were most commonly immunodetected peripherally,
with loss of expression in central keratinized zones. In contrast, in
non-keratinizing carcinomas, p63 and phospho-histone H1 expression was most
commonly observed throughout tumour nests and anti-GLUT1 stained in a pattern
suggestive of hypoxia-induced expression ('antistromal' staining), in which cells
at the tumour-stromal interface were GLUT1- and cells in central, perinecrotic
zones showed progressive induction of GLUT1. Intraepithelial components also
displayed basal and 'antibasal' GLUT1 staining patterns, homologous to the pro-
and antistromal patterns in invasive carcinoma; basal patterns in intraepithelial
lesions appeared to be more predictive of keratinizing invasive carcinoma and
antibasal intraepithelial staining more predictive of non-keratinizing poorly
differentiated carcinomas. Conclusions : Keratinizing and non-keratinizing
squamous carcinomas differ in expression patterns of GLUT1, p63 and
phospho-histone H1. In the former, all three markers were typically suppressed in
conjunction with keratinization; in the latter, GLUT1 expression was more likely 
to occur in a hypoxia-inducible pattern and expression of p63 and phospho-histone
H1 was unsuppressed. GLUT1 expression patterns in intraepithelial lesions may be 
predictive of the differentiation status of the associated invasive carcinoma.

AIM: Most epithelial malignancies are characterized by multistep progression from
preinvasive/intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive malignancy. Detection and
grading of early squamous intraepithelial neoplasia may at times be problematic. 
The aim of this study was to examine the ability of immunomarkers GLUT1,
phospho-histone H1 and p63 to detect such early lesions.
METHODS: Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 27 cases of
squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, 26 associated with invasive carcinoma, were
immunostained with anti-p63 (4A4; Santa Cruz), anti-GLUT1 (Chemicon) and
anti-phospho-histone H1 (monoclonal 12D11) and compared with normal, hyperplastic
and immature squamous metaplastic epithelium.
RESULTS: Normal epithelium displayed phospho-histone H1 in scattered parabasal
cells; p63 in the basal one-quarter to one-half of epithelium; and GLUT1
negativity or weak/equivocal mid-epithelial GLUT1+ foci. In hyperplasia
phospho-histone H1+ cells were also limited to the parabasal layer; p63
positivity was essentially identical to that in normal epithelium; GLUT1
characteristically stained basal cells in rete-like areas. p63 staining in
squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 1) was indistinguishable from normal
epithelial staining; in contrast, squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 3)
was readily apparent, with up to full-thickness p63 positivity. Squamous
intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 1) was readily distinguishable from normal
epithelium with both phospho-histone H1 and GLUT1 immunostaining; both markers
were detected in cell layers above the parabasal layer. With both, progressively 
higher cell layers stained in proportion to the severity of the intraepithelial
neoplasia, up to full thickness positivity in grade 3 squamous intraepithelial
neoplasia. Squamous metaplasia and grade 3 squamous intraepithelial neoplasia
were not distinguishable with p63 (both showed full-thickness staining) but were 
readily distinguishable with GLUT1 and phospho-histone H1 stains. GLUT1 appeared 
to be the most sensitive marker for all grades of intraepithelial neoplasia.
CONCLUSION: Altered expression of all three markers was a common finding in
squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, hence, dysregulation of cell cycle-promoting 
cyclin-dependent kinases (phospho-histone H1), altered stem cell regulatory
pathways (p63) and enhancement of hypoxia-sensing pathways (GLUT1) are all early 
alterations in the progression of squamous malignancy of head and neck origin. A 
panel of all three may be a useful means of detecting squamous intraepithelial
neoplasia.

AIMS: Recent studies have suggested that benign papillary lesions without atypia 
[benign papilloma (BP)] diagnosed on breast core needle biopsy (CNB) may not
require excision. However, most have studied only small numbers of cases and
scant data are available on the utility of immunohistochemistry in the
categorization of papillary lesions on CNB. In the largest published series of BP
identified on CNB, we studied the impact of immunohistochemistry on the accuracy 
of a CNB diagnosis of BP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Breast CNBs (n = 129) with a diagnosis of papillary lesion
were immunostained for calponin, p63 and cytokeratin 5/6. Haematoxylin and eosin 
and immunostained slides were independently reviewed by four breast pathologists.
BP was the final excision diagnosis in 35 cases. With the use of
immunohistochemistry, the positive predictive value (PPV) of BP diagnosis by the 
four individual pathologists increased from 72.7-83.3% (mean 79.2%) to 77.8-87.5%
(82.1%), the negative predictive value (NPV) increased from 77.8-98.5% (88.6%) to
100% for all four participants and overall accuracy increased from 78.7-92.6%
(84.7%) to 90.7-95.4% (92.8%). No case of invasive carcinoma was diagnosed as BP 
on CNB by any participant. The frequency of ductal carcinoma in situ following a 
BP diagnosis on CNB ranged from 2.5% to 4.8% (4%) but was only 0-3% (2.3%) after 
excluding cases that were radiologically suspicious for malignancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry increases accuracy of BP diagnosis in CNB
specimens. Benign papillary lesions diagnosed on CNB do not require excision in
the absence of suspicious clinical/radiological findings.

The p63 protein is crucial for epidermal development, and its mutations cause the
extrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome. The
three-dimensional solution structure of the p63 sterile alpha-motif (SAM) domain 
(residues 505-579), a region crucial to explaining the human genetic disease
ankyloblepharonectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome (AEC), has been determined 
by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure indicates that the
domain is a monomer with the characteristic five-helix bundle topology observed
in other SAM domains. It includes five tightly packed helices with an extended
hydrophobic core to form a globular and compact structure. The dynamics of the
backbone and the global correlation time of the molecule have also been
investigated and compared with the dynamical properties obtained through
molecular dynamics simulation. Attempts to purify the pathological G534V and
T537P mutants, originally identified in AEC, were not successful because of the
occurrence of unspecific proteolytic degradation of the mutated SAM domains.
Analysis of the structural dynamic properties of the G534V and T537P mutants
through molecular dynamics simulation and comparison with the wild type permits
detection of differences in the degree of freedom of individual residues and
discussion of the possible causes for the pathology.

Notch signaling promotes commitment of keratinocytes to differentiation and
suppresses tumorigenesis. p63, a p53 family member, has been implicated in
establishment of the keratinocyte cell fate and/or maintenance of epithelial
self-renewal. Here we show that p63 expression is suppressed by Notch1 activation
in both mouse and human keratinocytes through a mechanism independent of cell
cycle withdrawal and requiring down-modulation of selected interferon-responsive 
genes, including IRF7 and/or IRF3. In turn, elevated p63 expression counteracts
the ability of Notch1 to restrict growth and promote differentiation. p63
functions as a selective modulator of Notch1-dependent transcription and
function, with the Hes-1 gene as one of its direct negative targets. Thus, a
complex cross-talk between Notch and p63 is involved in the balance between
keratinocyte self-renewal and differentiation.

Stem cells are a source of differentiated cells in multiple tissues. If genetic
alterations occur in stem cells, the problem persists and malignant cancers may
arise. DeltaNp63alpha-a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53-is exclusively
expressed in proliferating undifferentiated epithelial cells and cancer cells of 
epidermal origin. Here, we show that DeltaNp63alpha antagonizes DNA
damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. We found that upon cellular
injury, DeltaNp63alpha must be downregulated before apoptotic program can be
activated. The 5637 cell line has abundant levels of DeltaNp63alpha and mutant
p53, and it is resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The knockdown of
DeltaNp63alpha by RNA interference sensitized these cells to apoptosis upon
genotoxic insult. This suggests that DeltaNp63alpha plays an anti-apoptotic role 
regardless of the p53 status. Considering the frequent mutations of p53 in tumor 
cells, our results provide important implications for the treatment of cancers in
which p63 is amplified.

p63, p73 and p53 compose a family of transcription factors involved in cell
response to stress and development. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in
cancer (50%) and loss of p53 activity is considered to be ubiquitous to all
cancers. Recent publications may have a profound impact on our understanding of
p53 tumour suppressor activity. p63, p73 and p53 genes have a dual gene structure
conserved in drosophila, zebrafish and man. They encode for multiple p63, p73 or 
p53 proteins containing different protein domains (isoforms) due to multiple
splicing, alternative promoter and alternative initiation of translation. In this
review, we describe the different isoforms of p63, p73, p53 and their roles in
development and cancer. The changes in the interactions between p53, p63 and p73 
isoforms are likely to be fundamental to our understanding in the transition
between normal cell cycling and the onset of tumour formation.

The discovery that the p53 family consists of three members (p53, p63 and p73) in
vertebrates and of a single homolog in invertebrates has raised the challenge of 
understanding the functions of the ancestor and how they have evolved and
differentiated within the duplicated genes in vertebrates. Here, we report that
the fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene, encoding for a key enzyme involved in the
biogenesis of membrane lipids in rapidly proliferating cells, is a conserved
target of the p53 family throughout the evolution. We show that CEP-1, the C.
elegans p53 homolog, is able to bind the two p53 family responsive elements (REs)
identified in the worm fasn-1 gene. Moreover, we demonstrate that fasn-1
expression is modulated by CEP-1 in vivo, by comparing wild-type and CEP-1
knockout worms. In human, luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
demonstrate that TAp73alpha and DeltaNp63alpha, but not p53, TAp73beta and
TAp63alpha bind the two p53 REs of the human FASN gene. We show that the ectopic 
expression of TAp73alpha and DeltaNp63alpha leads to an increase of FASN mRNA
levels, while their silencing produces a decrease of FASN expression.
Furthermore, we present data showing a correlation between DeltaNp63alpha and
FASN expression in cellular proliferation. Of relevant importance is that fasn-1 
is the first CEP-1 direct target gene identified so far in C. elegans and our
results suggest a new CEP-1 role in cellular proliferation and development,
besides the one already described in apoptosis of germ cells. These data confirm 
the hypothesis that the ancestral functions of the single invertebrate gene may
have been spread out among the three vertebrate members, each of them have
acquired specific role in cell cycle regulation.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical
expression of p16, p53, and p63 proteins according to some pathologic parameters 
related to colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas such as grade of dysplasia and
histologic type.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry with the antibodies p16, p53, and p63 was performed
in tubular, tubular-villous, and villous adenomas (n = 30) and in well,
moderately, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (n = 30). The p63-positive 
cases were submitted to double immunolabeling with the cytokeratin 5 (CK5).
RESULTS: The p16 and p53 labelings were observed in some adenomas and
adenocarcinomas but without any association with p63 expression, histologic type,
or grade of differentiation of the neoplasm. P63 expression was found mainly in
the villous adenomas and in the poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. The poorly
differentiated adenocarcinomas also exhibited coexpression of CK5 and p63.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite both p16 and p53 having been detected in colorectal
neoplasms, they were not related to the different histologic variables nor to the
expression of p63. However, p63 expression was closely associated with villous
adenomas and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Thus, p63 may represent a
marker of poor differentiation in colorectal neoplasms. The coexpression of p63
and CK5 observed in this study could be related to divergent differentiation
during the development of colorectal cancer, although further studies are
warranted to refine the understanding of this process.

The immunohistochemical detection of myoepithelial cells in benign sclerosing
lesions of the breast is useful in distinguishing them from tubular carcinoma. So
far, this detection has been carried out using antibodies against cytoskeletal
proteins, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (1A4) and calponin. However, the
specificity of these markers has been questioned since they may be expressed in
stromal myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle. Recently, two novel
myoepithelial markers have been described: the nuclear protein p63, a member of
the p53 family, and the surface antigen CD10, also known as common acute
lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). The authors assessed the use of p63 and
CD10 in the differential diagnosis between benign sclerosing lesions, such as
sclerosing adenosis and radial scar, and tubular carcinoma, in comparison to the 
traditional myoepithelial markers 1A4 and calponin. p63, CD10, 1A4, and calponin 
were expressed in myoepithelial cells of all benign lesions and were consistently
negative in all cases of tubular carcinoma. In contrast to cytoskeletal proteins,
p63 and CD10 were mostly confined to myoepithelial cells and thus were more
specific than the traditional counterparts. However, 1A4 was more intensely
expressed and more reproducible than the novel markers. In conclusion, p63 and
CD10 may be used as a complement to 1A4 in distinguishing benign sclerosing
lesions from tubular carcinoma of the breast.

p63 splicing variants lacking NH(2)-terminal transactivating domain, known as
DeltaNp63, are thought to antagonize p53 and p63 functions and are suggested to
play roles in keratinocyte differentiation. Here, we show that DeltaNp63 has a
dual-regulatory effect on the activity of its own promoter in NPC-076 cell.
Down-regulation of the transcriptional activity is observed when DeltaNp63 is
present in low levels. In contrast, up-regulation of DeltaNp63 transcriptional
activity is observed when DeltaNp63 is expressed at higher levels. The
down-regulation effect is abolished when the p53-binding site of the DeltaNp63
promoter is mutated. In sharp contrast, similar mutation does not affect the
up-regulation of the DeltaNp63 transcriptional activity under the same
experimental conditions. Further study shows that the up-regulation is correlated
with the activation of the STAT3, as the blockade of STAT3 nuclear translocation 
abolishes the up-regulation by DeltaNp63. Thus, DeltaNp63 exerts a bidirectional 
regulation of the DeltaNp63 transcriptional activity in NPC-076 cell.

AIMS: p63 has been recently reported to be expressed in sarcomatoid/metaplastic
carcinoma of the breast, in addition to its role as a myoepithelial marker. A
large series of 34 metaplastic carcinomas, including cases with pure epithelial
component (squamous cell and adenosquamous carcinomas), biphasic tumours with
carcinomatous and sarcomatoid components and monophasic tumours with only spindle
cell component, were evaluated for p63 expression with respect to the different
cellular components.
METHODS: All of the metaplastic carcinomas were assessed for p63 and conventional
epithelial and mesenchymal markers of AE1/3, CAM5.2 and vimentin by
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: All of the different categories of metaplastic carcinomas showed similar
clinico-pathological features (patient age, tumour size, nuclear grade, mitotic
activity, lymph node status and hormonal receptor status). For metaplastic
carcinoma with epithelial component only, p63 was only expressed in the squamous 
cell component, but not the adenocarcinoma component. Eight of the 10 tumours
were positive for p63. For the tumours with sarcomatoid component, either singly 
or together with carcinomatous component, p63 was positive in 14 of 24 cases.
Pure sarcomas and carcinomas were all negative for p63 staining by
immunohistochemistry, thus rendering p63 staining highly specific for diagnosing 
metaplastic carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Using p63 for diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma gives a sensitivity
of 65%, a specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative 
predictive value of 66% and an accuracy of 78%. p63 may be used as an adjunct
marker in the diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma.

The p63alpha isoforms of the p53 family have been demonstrated to play a crucial 
role in the development and differentiation of the skin. We show that expression 
of the TAp63alpha isoform leads to an upregulation of the cutaneous
papillomavirus HPV 20 promoter, which is increased at least three-fold when c-Jun
is co-expressed, in contrast to a minimal increase in activity in the presence of
c-Jun alone. Co-expression of TAp63alpha with JunB or JunD, respectively, and in 
combination, leads to a reduction in the viral promoter activation measured by
the expression of TAp63alpha alone. JunB and JunD also inhibits the additive
effect exerted on the TAp63alpha activation by c-Jun. Co-immunoprecipitation
assays demonstrate a complex formation of c-Jun, JunB and JunD with TAp63alpha
through the SAM domain mediating protein-protein interactions, which is
characteristic for p63alpha. Co-expression of p53 mutant R248W not only
downregulates the differential modulation of the viral promoter by TAp63alpha
alone and in the presence of the Jun family members, but leads to a reduction in 
the protein levels of the overexpressed c-Jun, JunB, JunD, as well as TAp63alpha.
This model system provides insight into yet unknown pathways through which
TAp63alpha and Jun may cooperate in the pathogenesis of HPV associated cutaneous 
lesions.

p63 is a developmentally regulated transcription factor related to p53, which
activates and represses specific genes. The human AEC (Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal
dysplasia-Clefting) and EEC (Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal dysplasia-Cleft lip/palate) 
syndromes are caused by missense mutations of p63, within the DNA-binding domain 
(EEC) or in the C-terminal sterile alpha motif domain (AEC). We show here that
p63 represses transcription of cell-cycle G(2)/M genes by binding to multiple
CCAAT core promoters in immortalized and primary keratinocytes. The
CCAAT-activator NF-Y and DeltaNp63alpha are associated in vivo and a conserved
alpha-helix of the NF-YC histone fold is required. p63 AEC mutants, but not an
EEC mutant, are incapable to bind NF-Y. DeltaNp63alpha, but not the AEC mutants
repress CCAAT-dependent transcription of G(2)/M genes. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation recruitment assays establish that the AEC mutants are not
recruited to G(2)/M promoters, while normally present on 14-3-3sigma, which
contains a sequence-specific binding site. Surprisingly, the EEC C306R mutant
activates transcription. Upon keratinocytes differentiation, NF-Y and p63 remain 
bound to G(2)/M promoters, while HDACs are recruited, histones deacetylated, Pol 
II displaced and transcription repressed. Our data indicate that NF-Y is a
molecular target of p63 and that inhibition of growth activating genes upon
differentiation is compromised by AEC missense mutations.

OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of deltaNp63 in human salivary gland tumor
and analyze its role in the malignant salivary gland tumors.
METHODS: Collecting the samples from 68 cases of pathologically proven salivary
gland tumours and investigating the microscopic sections with HE stain and
immunohistochemical-SP stain.
RESULTS: It was found that the expression of deltaNp63 is gradually increased in 
the malignant tumours, the myoepithelial cells and the basal cells of the
salivary gland tumors are positive, and the expression of deltaNp63 is correlated
directly with benign and malignant tumor.
CONCLUSION: deltaNp63 plays an important role in salivary gland tumours.
deltaNp63 possesses some special activity that is characteristic of oncogene. p63
is a sensitive and highly specific marker of myoepithelial cells in salivary
gland tumours and an additional marker for defining myoepithelial histogenesis.
p63 is of definite clinical value in falicitating diagnosis and differential
diagnosis.

p63, a p53 homolog has been shown to play a role in development and cancer. p63
is essential for both commitment of ectoderm to stratified epithelia and for the 
proliferative potential of epithelial stem cells. p63 knockout mice are born with
severe development defects and lack organs of epithelial origin. In addition, p63
has also been shown to play a role in cancer development through the differential
regulation of genes with tumor suppressor function and genes involved in
metastasis. In order to understand the role of p63 in cancer and development,
genes that are specifically regulated by p63 but not p53 were identified. In this
study, we provide evidence that p63gamma specifically upregulates vitamin D
Receptor (VDR). In contrast, p53 does not appear to be involved in upregulation
of VDR expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring p63
missense mutant, p63gamma (R279H) and p14(ARF), both act in a dominant negative
manner to inhibit p63gamma-mediated upregulation of VDR. Furthermore, using
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that p63 directly binds to 
the VDR promoter in vivo. Our findings clearly demonstrate that VDR is a direct
target of p63 and suggests that p63 may play a role in cancer and differentiation
through modulation of the VDR pathway.

The p53 paralogues p73, p63 and their respective truncated isoforms have been
shown to be critical regulators of developmental and differentiation processes.
Indeed, both p73- and p63-deficient mice exhibit severe developmental defects.
Here, we show that S100A2 gene, whose transcript and protein are induced during
keratinocyte differentiation of HaCaT cells, is a direct transcriptional target
of p73beta and DeltaNp63alpha and is required for proper keratinocyte
differentiation. Transactivation assays reveal that p73beta and DeltaNp63alpha
exert opposite transcriptional effects on S100A2 gene. While DeltaNp63alpha is
found in vivo onto S100A2 regulatory regions predominantly in proliferating
cells, p73beta is recruited in differentiating cells. Silencing of p73 impairs
the induction of S100A2 during the differentiation of HaCaT cells. Moreover,
silencing of p73 or S100A2 impairs the proper expression of keratinocyte
differentiation markers. Of note, p53 family members do not trigger S100A2 gene
expression in response to apoptotic doses of cisplatin and doxorubicin.

GPX2, a direct target of p63, inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in a
p53-dependent manner.

The p53 family consists of p53, p63, and p73, each of which has multiple isoforms
due to transcription at two separate promoters and alternative splicing. Although
p53 is a bona fide tumor suppressor, p63 appears to have a Janus-faced function
as a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. To address the two opposing functions of
p63, we analyzed its target genes. Here, we found that GPX2, which encodes a
glutathione peroxidase, is up-regulated by p63 but not p53. Accordingly, a unique
responsive element was found in the promoter of the GPX2 gene that can be
activated and bound by p63 but not p53. We also found that upon overexpression,
GPX2 alleviates the apoptotic response of MCF7 cells to oxidative stresses.
Interestingly, the protective function of GPX2 is p53 dependent. Likewise, we
showed that a deficiency in GPX2 renders MCF7 cells susceptible to oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis. Given that the deltaN isoform of p63 is frequently
overexpressed in tumor cells, the observations here provide an insight into the
mechanism by which some isoforms of p63 serve as a pro-survival factor by
up-regulating GPX2 to reduce the p53-dependent oxidative stress-induced apoptotic
response.

Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal disease and its underlying biology is poorly
understood. The p63 is a homologue gene of the tumor suppressor p53. p63 appears 
to be important for the development and differentiation of reproductive
epithelium and interacts with p53 in human tumorigenesis. This study presents the
immunoexpression of the p63 in benign and malignant epithelial ovarian tumors. We
evaluated the p63 immunoexpression in 91 ovarian benign cystadenomas (29 mucinous
and 62 serous) and in 29 ovarian malignant tumors (3 mucinous borderline, 3
serous borderline, 17 serous carcinomas, 2 endometrioid, 2 undifferentiated, 1
mucinous, and 1 clear-cell carcinoma) using a monoclonal antibody clone 4A4
(1:200), which recognizes all p63 variants. The tumors were considered p63
positive if 5% or more cells presented nuclear immunostaining. We observed 85.7% 
of positivity in benign tumors, 50% in borderline tumors, and 8.7% in invasive
ovarian cancer (P < .0001). The benign serous cystadenomas were positive in 91.9%
of cases and benign mucinous cystadenomas in 72.4% (P= .02). These data suggests 
an important role of p63 in the control of ovarian epithelium behavior. The p63
may be involved in the development of benign and malignant epithelial ovarian
tumors.

Cellular senescence is a distinctive form of cell cycle arrest that has been
suggested to modulate the processes of tumor suppression and aging. Though a
detailed understanding of the cellular machinery regulating this process is
emerging, a more thorough understanding of the key players linking senescence to 
organismal aging is needed. The recent discovery that loss of the p53-related
protein p63 induces cellular senescence and causes features of accelerated aging 
provides further evidence that cellular senescence is intimately linked with
organismal aging, and identifies p63 as a key regulator of both of these
processes.

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a potent tumor 
suppressor gene frequently mutated in human prostate cancers. Deletion of Pten in
a murine model of prostate cancer recapitulates the disease progression seen in
humans. Using defined cell lineage markers, we demonstrate that PTEN negatively
regulates p63-positive prostatic basal cell proliferation without blocking
differentiation. Concomitant with basal cell proliferation is the expansion of a 
prostate stem/progenitor-like subpopulation as evidenced by the progressive
increase of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1)- and BCL-2-positive cells. This
observation provides strong evidence that basal cell proliferation can be an
initiating event for precancerous lesions. Sca-1(+) and BCL-2(+) progenitors may 
serve as cancer-initiating cells in this model.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the p63 gene in normal
human tooth buds at different gestational stages. This is the first detailed
study of p63 expression in normal human prenatal tooth primordia. The material
consisted of sections of the midaxial tissue block from the cranial base of three
human fetuses of gestational ages (GA) 11, 15, and 21 weeks. The sections
included tooth primordia representing cap stages and bell stages of human tooth
morphogenesis. In the present study, immunostaining was carried out using the
primary antibody, monoclonal mouse anti human p63 protein, clone 4A4. The
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin Mayer. p63 immunoreactivity was
identified by microscopy. The study showed a positive reaction of p63 in both the
cap stage and the bell stage. In both stages, positivity was observed in the
cells of the oral mucosa, the inner and outer enamel epithelium, and in the
primary and secondary dental lamina. In the early cap stage, there is a strong
positive reaction to p63 in the enamel knot, but not in the late cap stage. We
suggest that p63 may have an important regulatory function in the enamel knot.

Psoriasis is a chronic and excessive inflammation of the skin and is currently
incurable. The cause of psoriasis remains poorly understood and a central and
cooperative role for keratinocytes and T-cells in triggering the disease is
highlighted. The p63 gene encodes six different proteins with homology to the
tumor suppressor protein p53 that are crucial for normal development of
ectodermally derived structures such as skin and oral mucosa. In this study, we
have analyzed levels of the different p63 isoforms using quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in 15
patients diagnosed with psoriasis. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed
downregulation of the full-length TAp63 in psoriatic lesions compared to both
clinically normal skin from patients (P<0.001) and matched healthy controls
(P<0.001); however, p63 protein levels detected by immunohistochemistry were
similar. All psoriasis lesions also had detectable levels of activated Stat3, a
protein indicated in development of the disease, whereas control tissue lacked
this protein. The present data show a different regulation of TAp63 in psoriasis,
where the discrepancy between mRNA levels and protein expression indicates a
post-transcriptional regulation analogous to that seen in p53.

We demonstrate that deltaNp63alpha is an essential survival factor in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through its ability to suppress
p73-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of endogenous p63 expression by RNAi induces 
apoptosis selectively in HNSCC cells that overexpress deltaNp63alpha. Knockdown
of p63 induces the proapoptotic bcl-2 family members Puma and Noxa, and both
their induction and subsequent cell death are p53 independent but require
transactivating isoforms of p73. Inhibition of p73-dependent transcription by
deltaNp63alpha involves both direct promoter binding and physical interaction
with p73. In HNSCC cells lacking endogenous deltaNp63alpha expression, bcl-2 is
instead upregulated and can suppress p73-mediated death. Together, these data
define a pathway whereby deltaNp63alpha promotes survival in squamous epithelial 
malignancy by repressing a p73-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional program.

The status and interrelationship of p53 family members are critical elements in
tumor progression. An intriguing paper in this issue of Cancer Cell (Rocco et
al., 2006) reveals a new twist in the interactions between p63 and p73 following 
DNA damage, underscoring a role for p73 in the proapoptotic regulation of Puma,
Noxa, and Bcl-2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). These data
define a pathway in which deltaNp63alpha promotes survival in squamous epithelial
malignancy by repressing a p73-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional program,
suggesting that p63 levels and p73 status may be key determinants of tumor
response in patients with HNSCC.

An unresolved issue regards the role of p73 and p63, the two homologs of the p53 
oncosuppressor gene, in normal cells and in tumor development. Specific target
genes for each protein need to be identified and characterized in order to
understand the specific role of each protein in tumor initiation and progression 
as well as in oncosuppression and development. We tested whether p63 is
implicated in transcriptional events related to sustaining cell proliferation by 
transactivation of antiapoptotic and cell survival target genes such as Adenosine
Deaminase (ADA), an important gene involved in cell proliferation. We demonstrate
that ADA is a direct target gene of p63 isoforms. In human keratinocytes, the
rate of proliferation and the high level of ADA transcript diminished upon
elimination of p63 by small interfering RNA. Reporter assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments indicate a physical interaction of p63 with the
two putative p53 binding sites we identified in the ADA gene. Moreover, in
response to p53 stabilization and DeltaNp63 downregulation in normal
keratinocytes after U.V. treatment, we found a change in the transcriptional
pattern of the p53 family target genes, consistent with the different roles
played by p53 and p63 in tumor suppression and cellular proliferation. In fact
p53 upregulation determined an increase in p21, which in turn mediated the cell
cycle arrest, while the downregulation of DeltaNp63 determined a marked decrease 
in ADA transcript. The experiments reported here support the hypothesis that
TAp63 and DeltaNp63 might contribute to tumor genesis not exclusively by
antagonizing p53, but by conferring a proliferative potential on cancer cells
through the transactivation of target genes indispensable for cell division, such
as the Adenosine Deaminase gene.

PURPOSE: Histopathological diagnosis of small focus carcinomas in prostatic
needle biopsies is often assisted by IHC. To make a definitive diagnosis the
pathologist must compare IHC findings with hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue
morphology. We introduce what is to our knowledge a new application of virtual
microscopy, in which hematoxylin and eosin, and IHC stains done sequentially on
the same microscope slide can be simultaneously displayed and compared on a
computer screen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 hematoxylin and eosin stained prostatic
needle biopsies were scanned with a computer controlled microscope. The slides
were destained and then immunostained with a cocktail of AMACR and p63
antibodies, which labels the nuclei of nonmalignant basal cells (p63) and the
cytoplasm of neoplastic glandular cells suspicious for malignancy (AMACR). The
slides were then scanned again and the pairs of virtual slides were aligned for
synchronized viewing.
RESULTS: The presented technique was found helpful when suspicious lesions were
small and when examining the immunoprofile of specimens was warranted, in
addition to examining hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue morphology. The
usefulness of our approach based on virtual microscopy can be evaluated on the
website , which also serves as an educational tool for self-learning the
correlation between hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue morphology, and
AMACR/p63 IHC in prostate biopsies.
CONCLUSIONS: The technology for simultaneously viewing sequentially hematoxylin
and eosin and IHC stained prostate biopsies can be readily used for educational
purposes, as exemplified by our website, and along with the availability of rapid
virtual slide scanners it can also be used for clinical diagnostics.

The transcription factor p63 is a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53. Unlike
p53, which is dispensable for normal development, p63 is critical for the
development of stratified epithelial tissues such as epidermis, breast, and
prostate. p63 encodes multiple protein isoforms with both transactivating and
transcriptional repressor activities that can regulate a wide spectrum of target 
genes. p63 is also implicated in tumor formation and progression in stratified
epithelia, with evidence for both tumor suppressive and oncogenic properties.
This review will examine current data and hypotheses regarding the role of p63 in
the development, maintenance, and tumorigenesis of stratified epithelium.

Decreased expression of p63 in oral lichen planus and graft-vs.-host disease
associated with oral inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP) and graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) are
conditions with increased risk of malignant transformation to squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The p63 gene encodes six different
proteins and is expressed at high levels in SCCHN.
METHODS: Biopsies from patients diagnosed with OLP and GVHD were analysed for p63
protein expression using antibodies distinguishing between the major isoforms
expressed in normal epithelia, in parallel with biopsies from normal buccal
mucosa and SCCHN.
RESULTS: In OLP and GVHD a decreased expression of all p63 isoforms was seen,
while expression of p53 protein was upregulated, compared with normal mucosa. In 
SCCHN, p63 was abundantly expressed and some tumours showed strong p53 staining, 
suggestive of p53 mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased p63 and increased p53 expression in OLP and GVHD indicates
a coordinated action of these two related proteins to protect the oral mucosae
from the damaging effects of underlying inflammation. In SCCHN disruption of the 
TP53 gene and overrepresentation of certain p63 isoforms has been seen,
indicating that this could lead to neoplastic transformation.

Sclerosing breast lesions may sometimes mimic the appearance of infiltrating
carcinoma due to the entrapment of ductular structures in a fibrotic core. The
immunohistochemical detection of the outer myoepithelial cell layer that is
indicative of a non-infiltrating lesion is a valuable clue for the diagnosis of
such ambiguous cases. The myoepithelial cell markers smooth muscle actin (SMA)
and p63 are most commonly used since their specificity and sensitivity are well
established. However, recent studies have indicated that some morphologically
distinct myoepithelial cells fail to stain for SMA and that p63 positivity can be
rarely expressed by a subset of malignant epithelial cells. Moreover, SMA can
also be positive in stromal myofibroblastic cells and normal vessels that can be 
found close to the entrapped ductules and might be erroneously interpreted as
myoepithelial cells. In this study, we used a double-immunolabeling technique
combining both SMA and p63 antibodies (myoepithelial cell cocktail), in order to 
investigate whether this technique is advantageous over either marker used alone,
in diagnosing sclerosing breast lesions. Our results indicate that p63 alone is
not a useful myoepithelial cell marker if applied in large sclerosing breast
lesions, however, in smaller lesions it is still of high value. On the contrary, 
SMA proved significantly useful in the evaluation of myoepithelial cells in
larger but not in smaller complex sclerosing lesions. The myoepithelial cell
cocktail has a staining sensitivity identical to that of SMA. Nevertheless, in a 
certain number of cases the cocktail might be useful in differentiating
myoepithelial cells from stromal myofibroblasts or vascular smooth muscle cells
due to the false impression of a higher staining intensity of the cocktail
resulting from the expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic/membranous
antibodies that occupy a wider area of the cell under control.

In general, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is not related to liver
cirrhosis. However, a few cases have been reported in which ICC was accompanied
by severe liver fibrosis. Some researchers have proposed that hepatocellular and 
cholangiocellular (HC-CC) carcinoma, an intermediate mixed phenotype possibly
arising in cirrhotic liver, might originate from hepatic precursor cells. In the 
liver, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes form the epithelial element, but stromal
and mesenchymal elements may be produced by hepatic stem cells. Based on these
aspects, not only HC-CC, but also other combinations of cellular phenotypes,
would cover all the cancers with stem cell features. In this study, which aimed
at determining the characteristics of the ICC phenotype, we used
immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of basal/stem-cell markers, i.e., 
p63 in ICC with and without liver cirrhosis, as well as the expressions of
cytokeratin (CK) 34 beta E12, specific for the basal-cell marker, and c-kit,
specific for the stem-cell marker. Aberrant p63 was frequently expressed in ICC
arising in cirrhotic liver. This result suggests that ICC cancer cells originate 
from hepatic precursor cells with a hidden multi-differentiation potential.

BACKGROUND: Ankyloblepharon, ectodermal defects, and cleft lip and palate (AEC)
syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the sterile
alpha motif region of TP63, a homologue of the tumor suppressor TP53. Recent
structure-function studies have identified complexities in the genotype-phenotype
correlation of the p63 syndromes.
OBSERVATIONS: We report 2 sporadic cases of AEC syndrome in infants. Both
patients demonstrated skin erosions with prominent scalp involvement. Histologic 
studies demonstrated mild basal layer vacuolization and rare dyskeratotic
keratinocytes, with evidence of both acantholysis and cytolysis at the blister
edge. Immunohistochemistry using anti-p63 monoclonal antibody demonstrated basal 
epidermal nuclear staining in both healthy control and patient tissue samples.
Ultrastructural studies showed focal disruption of anchoring fibrils near the
blister edge of one patient and normal desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and basement
membrane zone in the nonblistered skin of the other patient. The DNA analysis of 
each patient revealed 2 novel missense mutations in the TP63 gene that resulted
in L514S and R555P amino acid substitutions within the sterile alpha motif region
of the p63 protein.
CONCLUSIONS: We report 2 novel TP63 mutations resulting in AEC syndrome. The
R555P mutation is the most carboxy-terminal of all the reported AEC missense
mutations of p63. The presence of skin fragility, manifested as erosive skin
lesions in body areas in addition to the scalp, is postulated to be an important 
diagnostic feature of AEC syndrome.

Melanocytes and keratinocytes were analyzed for potential roles of p53, p73, and 
p63 tumor suppressor family proteins and of malignancy-specific gene expression
changes in the etiology of multi-step cancer. Melanocytes expressed
deltaNp73alpha, two p63 isoforms and p53. Although p21 and Noxa mRNA levels
increased following DNA damage, p53 family member binding to p21 and Noxa DNA
probes was undetectable, suggesting p53 family-independent responses. In
contrast, keratinocytes expressed multiple isoforms each of p73 and p63 that were
induced to bind p21 and Noxa DNA probes after ionizing (IR) or after ultraviolet 
B (UVB) irradiation, correlating with p21 and Noxa mRNA induction and with
apoptosis. Interestingly, IR-resistant malignant melanocytes and keratinocytes
both exhibited Noxa mRNA induction after UVB treatment, correlating with DNA
binding of p53 family proteins to the Noxa probe only in keratinocytes. To
uncover other malignancy-specific events, we queried mouse initiated keratinocyte
clones for early changes that were exacerbated in malignant derivatives and also 
differentially expressed in human advanced melanoma versus normal melanocytes.
Using a new method for ranking and normalization of microarray data for 5000
probe sets, 27 upregulated and 13 downregulated genes satisfied our query. Of
these, the majority was associated with late-stage human cancers and six were
novel genes. Thus, clonal lineage mouse models representing early through late
cancer progression stages may inform the focus on early, potentially causal
events from microarray studies of human cancers, facilitating prognosis and
molecular therapy.

p53, the original member of the family of genes now known to include p63 and p73,
was first heralded as an oncogene because of its potent transformation
capabilities and its robust expression in human tumors. However, it was later
discovered that only mutant p53 was oncogenic, and that wild type p53 functioned 
as a tumor suppressor. Decades later, p63, the newest member of this gene family,
is involved in a similar controversy: is p63 an oncogene or a tumor suppressor?
Recent progress on understanding the in vivo role of p63 in cancer has focused
primarily on investigating its involvement in the tumor-suppressive mechanism of 
apoptosis, by analyzing mouse models to assess its tumor-suppressive
capabilities, and by assessing its expression in human cancers.

Understanding the stages of cell differentiation in the normal prostate
epithelium is essential for the identification of the cell type(s) involved in
prostatic carcinogenesis. Prostate glands are composed of three types of
epithelial cells (i.e., basal, secretory and neuroendocrine) but the hierarchical
relations among these cell types have been long controversial. We have recently
developed a novel system to define prostate epithelial cell lineages in vivo. We 
find that, during normal prostate organogenesis, terminally differentiated
secretory cells derive from p63-positive basal cells, which thus
represent/include prostate stem cells. Future studies will determine if
p63-positive basal cells retain stem cells capabilities in the adult prostate
epithelium.

Microarray profiling of invasive breast carcinomas has identified five distinct
subtypes of tumors (luminal A, luminal B, normal breast-like, HER2
overexpressing, and basal-like) that are associated with different clinical
outcomes. The basal-like subtype is associated with poor clinical outcomes and is
the subtype observed in BRCA1-related breast cancers. The aim of this study was
to characterize the histologic and immunophenotypic properties of breast
basal-like carcinomas that were first positively identified using DNA microarray 
analysis. Detailed histologic review was performed on 56 tumors with known
microarray profiles (23 basal-like, 23 luminal, and 12 HER2+).
Immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, EGFR, smooth muscle actin 
(SMA), p63, CD10, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 8/18, and vimentin was performed
on 18 basal-like, 16 luminal, and 12 HER2+ tumors. The basal-like tumors were
grade 3 ductal/NOS (21/23) or metaplastic (2/23) carcinomas that frequently
showed geographic necrosis (17/23), a pushing border of invasion (14/23), and a
stromal lymphocytic response (13/23). Most basal-like tumors showed
immunoreactivity for vimentin (17/18), luminal cytokeratin 8/18 (15/18), EGFR
(13/18), and cytokeratin 5/6 (11/18), while positivity for the myoepithelial
markers SMA (4/18), p63 (4/18) and CD10 (2/18) was infrequent. All basal-like
tumors tested were ER- and HER2-. Morphologic features significantly associated
with the basal-like subtype included markedly elevated mitotic count (P<0.0001), 
geographic tumor necrosis (P=0.0003), pushing margin of invasion (P=0.0001), and 
stromal lymphocytic response (P=0.01). The most consistent immunophenotype seen
in the basal-like tumors was negativity for ER and HER2, and positivity for
vimentin, EGFR, cytokeratin 8/18, and cytokeratin 5/6. The infrequent expression 
of myoepithelial markers in basal-like carcinomas does not support a direct
myoepithelial cell derivation of these tumors. These findings should further
assist in the identification of basal-like carcinomas in clinical specimens,
facilitating treatment and epidemiologic studies of this tumor subtype.

TA-p63-gamma regulates expression of DeltaN-p63 in a manner that is sensitive to 
p53.

Genetic analysis indicates that TP63 is required for establishment and
preservation of self-renewing progenitors within the basal layer of several
epithelial structures, however, the specific contributions of transactivating
(TA-p63) and dominant-negative (DeltaN-p63) isoforms remain largely undefined.
Recent studies have suggested a model in which TA-p63 plays an important role in 
the establishment of progenitor populations in which expression of DeltaN-p63
contributes to the preservation of self-renewing capacity. Our previous studies
indicate that DeltaN-p63 is a transcriptional target of p53, however, the absence
of overt epithelial deficiencies in p53-/- mice and reports of increased
expression of DeltaN-p63 in p53-/- mice suggest p53-independent mechanisms also
contribute to expression of DeltaN-p63. Here, we present data indicating that,
prolonged loss of p53 leads to the activation of a p53-independent mechanism for 
transcriptional regulation of DeltaN-p63. This p53-independent mechanism is
sensitive to ectopic p53 but not to a p53 mutant that lacks the transactivation
domain. We further show that in cells in which p53 is expressed TA-p63-gamma
protein is destabilized in a manner that is p53 dependent and sensitive to
pharmacologic inhibition of the 26S proteosome. Consistent with this observation,
we demonstrate that loss of p53 leads to the stabilization of TA-p63-gamma that
is reversible by ectopic p53. Finally, we present evidence that disruption of
TA-p63-gamma expression leads to decreased expression of DeltaN-p63 and that
overexpression of TA-p63-gamma was sufficient to enhance the activity of the
DeltaN-p63 promoter. Taken together, our studies indicate that TA-p63-gamma is
capable of activating expression of DeltaN-p63 and that this mechanism may
account for p53-independent expression of DeltaN-p63.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the most common primary malignant tumor of the
conjunctiva, has a variable clinical presentation and immunohistochemical
profile. Abundant cell cycles exist, including MIB-1 (Ki67 antigen), p16, p53,
and p63, within the conjunctiva SCC. This investigation first reports the
expressions of cell cycle markers in SCC. A retrospective study was conducted
between December 1976 and June 2004, comprising 13 consecutive patients with
conjunctiva SCC who were treated with surgical excision. Detailed clinical
parameters were also reviewed. Overexpression of MIB-1, p16, p53, and p63 genes
were studied by immunohistochemistry. Genechip containing 39 subtypes was used to
elucidate human papillomavirus (HPV). The study group contained 13 (100%) men,
with a mean age of 68+/-18 years and follow-up period of 20+/-17 months. The
sample included four (33%) SCC located in the left eye and two (17%) recurrent
SCC. Overexpression of the p53 and p63 was considerably higher than that of the
p16 (P<0.01). HPV DNA was not detected in any of the 13 cases. This work first
examined the immunohistochemical overexpression of cell cycle (MIB-1, p16, p53,
and p63) in SCC. This investigation then showed that the expression of cell
cycles in SCC was associated with key tumor clinicopathological features. This
approach can help distinguish the potential roles of cell cycle in the

Two cases of a distinctive variety of basaloid squamous carcinoma (BSC) of the
anal canal are described. Both occurred in female patients who presented with
bleeding per rectum. Histologic evaluation of the tumors showed lobules and
aggregates of medium-sized basaloid cells with distinctive peripheral palisading 
and focal areas of central, comedo-necrosis. Accompanying dysplasia of the
overlying squamous mucosa was absent. However, the microscopic pattern was
dominated by the presence of eosinophilic, hyaline, paucicellular basement
membrane-like material around and within tumor nests. This appearance together
with microcystic spaces simulated that of an adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry of the tumors revealed the following profile: CK7, CK5/CK6, 
34betaE12 positive, CK14 focally positive but CK20 negative. The following were
all negative: EMA, CEA, smooth muscle and muscle-specific actin, calponin, and
S-100. The tumor cells exhibited diffuse nuclear positivity with p63. The
eosinophilic basement membrane hyaline material was positive for collagen type IV
and also for laminin. BSC of the anal canal with an adenoid cystic pattern is an 
infrequently encountered and reported variant, although it is seen more often in 
the aerodigestive tract. There may be an increased propensity for BSC with an
adenoid cystic pattern to metastasize to the liver, but the number of cases
encountered are too small to be definitive. The histologic differential diagnosis
is true salivary gland-type adenoid cystic carcinoma and basal cell
adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry and awareness of this unusual pattern of BSC
will facilitate the correct diagnosis being reached.

AIMS: The nuclear detection of p63 in myoepithelial cells of the breast has been 
useful in identifying possibly invasive carcinomas. While examining myoepithelial
cells for p63 a very strong cytoplasmic reaction product was noted in secretory
cells. The aim was to determine whether this reaction is specific for p63 and
indicative of all breast secretory cells.
METHODS: Thirty breast specimens were tested immunohistochemically for p63
protein. These included seven with benign secretory changes, 10 secretory
carcinomas (nine invasive), one microglandular adenosis, three lobular
neoplasias, four invasive ductal carcinomas, three clear cell carcinomas, one
squamous cell carcinoma and one mucinous carcinoma.
RESULTS: Only cells exhibiting secretory changes or secretory carcinoma were
cytoplasmically reactive for p63. The positive reaction was also present as an
intraluminal secretory product. This reaction was not seen in cells undergoing
apocrine differentiation or in other cells containing secretory vacuoles.
CONCLUSIONS: Cells with secretory changes contain p63 protein or an antigenic
equivalent. The detection of p63 protein continues to have considerable value for
the identification of myoepithelial cells and thus the determination of invasion,
but will also have value in the determination of secretory carcinomas of the
breast and in understanding their development.

Inactivation of p53 and p73 is known to promote thyroid cancer progression. We
now describe p63 expression and function in human thyroid cancer. TAp63alpha is
expressed in most thyroid cancer specimens and cell lines, but not in normal
thyrocytes. However, in thyroid cancer cells TAp63alpha fails to induce the
target genes (p21Cip1, Bax, MDM2) and, as a consequence, cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis occur. Moreover, TAp63alpha antagonizes the effect of p53 on target
genes, cell viability and foci formation, and p63 gene silencing by small
interfering (si) RNA results in improved p53 activity. This unusual effect of
TAp63alpha depends on the protein C-terminus, since TAp63beta and TAp63gamma
isoforms, which have a different arrangement of their C-terminus, are still able 
to induce the target genes and to exert tumour-restraining effects in thyroid
cancer cells. Our data outline the existence of a complex network among p53
family members, where TAp63alpha may promote thyroid tumour progression by
inactivating the tumour suppressor activity of p53.

p63 mutations have been associated with several human hereditary disorders
characterized by ectodermal dysplasia such as EEC (ectrodactyly, ectodermal
dysplasia, clefting) syndrome, ADULT (acro, dermato, ungual, lacrimal, tooth)
syndrome and AEC (ankyloblepharon, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting) syndrome (also
called Hay-Wells syndrome). The location and functional effects of the mutations 
that underlie these syndromes reveal a striking genotype-phenotype correlation.
Unlike EEC and ADULT that result from missense mutations in the DNA-binding
domain of p63, AEC is solely caused by missense mutations in the SAM domain of
p63. In this paper we report a study on the TAp63alpha isoform, the first to be
expressed during development of the embryonic epithelia, and on its naturally
occurring Q540L mutant derived from an AEC patient. To assess the effects of the 
Q540L mutation, we generated stable cell lines expressing TAp63alpha wt,
DeltaNp63alpha or the TAp63alpha-Q540L mutant protein and used them to
systematically compare the cell growth regulatory activity of the mutant and wt
p63 proteins and to generate, by microarray analysis, a comprehensive profile of 
differential gene expression. We found that the Q540L substitution impairs the
transcriptional activity of TAp63alpha and causes misregulation of genes involved
in the control of cell growth and epidermal differentiation.

p63, a member of the p53 family of transcription factors, is known to be involved
in epithelial development. However, its role in tumorigenesis is unclear.
Contributing to this uncertainty, the TP63 locus can express multiple gene
products from two different promoters. Utilization of the upstream promoter
results in expression of the TAp63 variant with an activation domain similar to
p53. In contrast, the NH2-terminally deleted (DeltaN) p63 variant, transcribed
from a cryptic promoter in intron 3, lacks such an activation domain. Thus, the
TAp63 and DeltaNp63 variants possess a wide ranging ability to up-regulate p53
target genes. Consequentially, the disparity in transactivation potential between
p63 variants has given rise to the hypothesis that the DeltaNp63 variant can
serve as oncoprotein by opposing the activity of the TAp63 variant and p53.
However, recent studies have revealed a transcriptional activity for DeltaNp63.
This study was undertaken to address the transcriptional activity of the
DeltaNp63 variant. Here, we showed that all NH2-terminally deleted p63 isoforms
retain a potential in transactivation and growth suppression. Interestingly,
DeltaNp63beta possesses a remarkable ability to suppress cell proliferation and
transactivate target genes, which is consistently higher than that seen with
DeltaNp63alpha. In contrast, DeltaNp63gamma has a weak or undetectable activity
dependent upon the cell lines used. We also demonstrate that an intact
DNA-binding domain is required for DeltaNp63 function. In addition, we found that
the novel activation domain for the DeltaNp63 variant is composed of the 14
unique DeltaN residues along with the adjacent region, including a PXXP motif.
Finally, we demonstrated that a PPXY motif shared by DeltaNp63alpha and
DeltaNp63beta is required for optimal transactivation of target gene promoters,
suggesting that the PPXY motif is requisite for DeltaNp63 function.

The human p63 gene encodes a series of proteins that differ in their N- and/or
C-terminal sequences and have widely differing properties in promoting or
repressing p53-related functions such as growth arrest and apoptosis. In
addition, p63 has important roles in the maintenance and differentiation of
epithelial cell populations. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck
(SCCHN) express high levels of DeltaNp63 and p63beta isoforms compared to normal 
tissue from the same patients, suggesting a role for these isoforms in the
pathogenesis of this common human malignancy. Here, we explore the function of
p63 in SCCHN cells by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the
expression of different isoforms in two SCCHN cell lines, FaDu and SCC-25.
Silencing results in statistically significant decreased survival for tumour
cells when all p63 isoforms, the N-terminal truncated or the alpha isoforms are
inhibited. No effect was observed on cell proliferation or on the expression of
epithelial differentiation markers. We also demonstrate that inhibition of
endogenous p63 expression sensitises cells to the effects of ionizing radiation
and cisplatin, common treatments for SCCHN patients. The data indicate that p63
has oncogenic properties in SCCHN and is predominantly involved in maintaining
cell survival, rather than acting as a directly proliferative factor or as an
inhibitor of terminal differentiation. Moreover, targeted inhibition of p63
expression in SCCHN could be a useful adjunct for conventional treatments of this
disease.

Expression of p63, COX-2, EGFR and beta-catenin in smokers and patients with
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reveal variations in non-neoplastic 
tissue and no obvious changes in smokers.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the 6th most common
malignancy in the world, is associated with smoking and has a low 5-year survival
rate. Various changes have been described at different stages of SCCHN tumour
development, including overexpression of p63, a protein important for development
of normal epidermal structures. p63 has been suggested to activate beta-catenin, 
and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is an important event in many cancers.
Elevated COX-2 activity and overexpression of EGFR protein has been shown in a
variety of human cancers, including SCCHN. An important question for the
pathogenesis of SCCHN is when the genetic changes take place during the natural
course of the disease, and whether they appear in clinically normal oral mucosa
to predispose tumour development. We mapped the expression of p63, COX-2, EGFR,
beta-catenin, and PP2A in oral mucosa from smokers/non-smokers and from patients 
with SCCHN. We also considered if changes occurring in tumours are present in the
clinically normal tissue adjacent to the tumour. No direct influence of heavy
smoking on the levels of the proteins studied could be seen. Tumours and
clinically normal non-neoplastic tissue from SCCHN patients showed increased
expression of COX-2 and PP2A. Interestingly, non-neoplastic tissue adjacent to
SCCHN also showed increased beta-catenin, although this was not seen in tumours. 
The data support the notion that pre-existing alterations in clinically normal
epithelium exist in patients with SCCHN and could be important for the
pathogenesis of the disease and for local recurrences.

To illustrate the role of p63 and its truncated variants in salivary gland
tumors, 23 consecutive tumors and 6 normal salivary glands were studied
immunohistochemically with anti-p63 antibody and by reverse transcriptase (RT)
and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect p63 isoform expression.
Normal salivary glands: p63 antibody-stained basal and myoepithelial cells; by RT
and nested PCR, the 2 main isoforms were present, whereas DeltaNp73L was absent. 
Tumors: p63 antibody was positive in the following: Warthin tumor (WT) (3/3),
oncocytoma (OC) (1/1), pleomorphic adenoma (PA) (7/7), polymorphous-low-grade
adenocarcinoma (PLGA) (3/3), adenoid-cystic carcinoma (ADCC)(3/4),
epithelial-myoepithelial-cell carcinoma (EMC) (1/1), and myoepithelial-cell
carcinoma (MCC) (1/1). By RT and nested PCR all tumors expressed p63 irrespective
of their morphologic differentiation. The DeltaNp73L isoform was present in
tumoral tissue but absent in normal salivary gland. These data suggest that p63, 
particularly its splice variant DeltaNp73L, is involved in the neoplastic
transformation of salivary glands.

p73, a sophisticated p53 family member in the cancer world.

p73 belongs to a family of p53-related nuclear transcription factors that
includes p53, p73 and p63. The overall structure and sequence homology indicates 
that a p63/p73-like protogene is the ancestral gene, whereas p53 evolved later in
higher organisms. In accordance with their structural similarity, p73 functions
in a manner analogous to p53 by inducing tumor cell apoptosis and participating
in the cell cycle checkpoint control through transactivating an overlapping set
of p53/p73-target genes. In sharp contrast to p53, however, p73 is expressed as
two NH(2)-terminally distinct isoforms including transcriptionally active (TA)
and transcriptionally inactive (DeltaN) forms. DeltaNp73, which has oncogenic
potential, acts in a dominant negative manner against TAp73 as well as p53. p73
is induced to be stabilized in response to a subset of DNA-damaging agents in a
way that is distinct from that of p53, and exerts its pro-apoptotic activity.
Several lines of evidence suggest that p73 can induce tumor cell apoptosis in a
p53-dependent and p53-independent manner. Some tumors exhibit resistance to the
p53-dependent apoptotic program, therefore p73, which can induce apoptotic cell
death by p53-independent mechanisms, is particularly useful. In this review, we
discuss the regulatory mechanisms of p73 activity, and also the functional
significance of p73 in the regulation of cellular processes including
tumorigenesis, apoptosis and neurogenesis.

Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor: clinicopathological features with an emphasis on

We report on the clinical and histological features of five cases of epithelioid 
trophoblastic tumor, with an emphasis on its involvement of the uterine cervix.
All five patients were of reproductive age (median age 38.4 years) and all,
except one, presented with vaginal bleeding 3 to 18 years after the most recent
pregnancy. One patient presented with amenorrhea. Elevation of serum human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was seen in four cases. Pathologically, the tumor
involved endocervix in three cases and involved uterine corpus in another two.
All five tumors were invasive, nodular lesions consisting of epithelioid
intermediate trophoblastic cells that were mononuclear with abundant eosinophilic
cytoplasm, along with zones of hyaline material and necrotic debris. In three
cases of cervical involvement, the neoplastic cells focally replaced endocervical
surface and glandular epithelium, simulating high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesions. Immunohistochemically, all five tumors displayed focal positivity for
human placental lactogen and hCG. Positive nuclear staining of p63 was seen in
all five cases. All patients received total hysterectomy and various regimes of
adjuvant chemotherapy. Three patients survived the tumor with no recurrences or
metastases with follow-up periods of 3, 7 and 16 years. One patient is currently 
alive with lung metastasis 1 month after the surgery. One patient died of tumor
metastasis 8 months after the diagnosis. In summary, with its unusual ability to 
simulate an invasive squamous cell carcinoma and other epithelioid neoplasms,
epithelioid trophoblastic tumor frequently poses a diagnostic challenge,
especially when involving the uterine cervix. High index of suspicion and an
awareness of elevation of serum chorionic gonadotropin are crucial in reaching a 
correct diagnosis.

Regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57Kip2 expression by p63.

The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p57Kip2 is a negative regulator of
cell proliferation, binding to a variety of cyclin-CDK complexes and inhibiting
their kinase activities. The p57Kip2 gene was recognized as a target gene for
p73beta, one member of the p53 family. In spite of this, the phenotypes of p73
and p57Kip2 knockout mice do not resemble each other while there is a phenotypic 
overlap between the p57Kip2 null mice, the p63 null mice and patients affected by
p63 associated syndromes, suggesting that p57Kip2 could be indeed a downstream
target of p63. By ChIP we determined that in the HaCaT cell line the
DeltaNp63alpha protein is associated to three different regions of the p57Kip2
gene. DeltaNp63 can activate both the endogenous p57Kip2 gene and a reporter
vector containing a -2191 promoter fragment of the p57Kip2 gene. Natural p63
mutants, associated to the AEC syndrome, show a partial or complete lack of
transactivation potential of the p57Kip2 promoter, while three other natural p63 
mutants, associated to the EEC, LMS and SHFM-4 syndromes, were less affected.
These data suggests that p63 play an important role in the regulation of p57Kip2 
expression and that this regulation is subverted in AEC p63 mutants.

Alteration of the p63 protein expression has been associated with several human
cancers including salivary gland tumors. We sought to assess the p63 expression
in pleomorphic adenomas (PA) and carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenomas (Ca ex-PA),
since this protein has been related to myoepithelial phenotype and the biological
behavior of cancer. Ten samples of PA and ten of Ca ex-PA were submitted to
immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal anti-p63 antibody, clone 4A4. p63 was
regularly expressed in myoepithelial cells' nuclei of the normal glandular
parenchyma and in PA, but it was completely absent in five out of the ten samples
of Ca ex-PA. (P < 0.05 by Fisher's exact test). Apparently, only those cases
depicting some myoepithelial differentiation were positive. Our data suggest that
loss of myoepithelial differentiation is important in the evolution of Ca ex-PA, 
and corroborate the hypothesis that p63 antigen may be a useful marker of
myoepithelial cells in salivary glands neoplasms.

Hypermethylation of the putative tumor-suppressor genes DCC, p51/63 and

Alterations and defective expression of three putative tumor-suppressor genes,
the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), p51, and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT), have been demonstrated in many cancers. However, it is 
not known whether the defective expression of each of these genes is independent 
or whether it reflects a specific methylation abnormality. Here, we investigated 
the expression of the DCC, p51 and MGMT genes and the methylation status of the
5' flanking CpG region in 17 cell lines established from hematological
malignancies. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method showed
DCC expression to be absent in 13 of the 17 cell lines and showed expression of
both p51 and MGMT to be absent in 5 of the 17 cell lines. The methylation
patterns were analyzed with methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) 
of the 5'flanking region of the DCC and p51 genes and the promoter region of the 
MGMT gene. Although unmethylated patterns of the CpG region in the DCC, p51, and 
MGMT genes were observed in all 11 normal controls, abnormal methylation patterns
of these genes were found even in many cell lines expressing these genes. A
hypermethylation pattern was detected for the CpG region of MGMT and p51 in cells
that did not express these genes. In contrast, a hypermethylation pattern was not
always detected for the CpG region of DCC in cells with reduced DCC expression.
The results of this study indicate that in many hematological cell lines, the
DCC, p51, and MGMT genes have been abnormally methylated in the CpG region.
Hypermethylation of these three genes may be independent events in each cell
line.

AIMS: To study the expression of p63, cytokeratin (CK) 5 and CK8/18 in invasive
ductal carcinomas and their relationship with BRCA1 and other pathological and
immunohistochemical features of clinical significance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry with the antibodies p63, CK5, CK8/18,
BRCA1, oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53, c-erbB-2 and Ki67 was
performed in 102 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of invasive ductal
carcinomas. The CK5+ cases were submitted to a double-immunolabelling study with 
p63. There was a strong relationship between CK5 and p63 expression and both
markers were associated with hormonal receptor-negative high-grade carcinomas
with high proliferative rate. Furthermore, there was coexpression of CK5 and p63 
in neoplastic cells, indicating that p63, like CK5, is a marker of the basal
phenotype of breast cancer. There was a strong relationship between reduced
expression of BRCA1 with both p63 and CK5 expression as well as an inverse
correlation between p63 and CK8/18 expression, suggesting that loss of p63
expression is required for the transition between a basal to a luminal phenotype 
of breast carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Since p63 is thought to be a marker of stem cells and may act as an 
oncogene, our data support the idea that BRCA1 acts as stem cell regulator.

Mutations in the p63 gene have been identified in five human disorders
characterized by varying degrees of limb anomalies, ectodermal dysplasia, and
facial clefts. We report a new point mutation in the p63 gene in a family in
which the mother was initially diagnosed with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome and her two
offspring manifested ankyloblepharon, ectodermal defects, cleft lip and palate,
syndrome. These three patients are the first to be reported with this particular 
mutation, which consists of a change from glycine to aspartic acid at position
506 on exon 14. The clinical spectrum observed in the three family members
highlights the wide range of phenotypic variations that result from a single
point mutation in the p63 gene. The mother lacks certain features classically
associated with AEC, dermatitis of the scalp in particular. Severe erosive
dermatitis of the scalp developed in both offspring, along with previously
undescribed poikilodermatous skin changes and a deficiency of CD4 T lymphocytes. 
The new and varied phenotypic features noted in these patients emphasize the

Many events in vertebrate morphogenesis and organogenesis develop from
epithelial/mesenchymal interactions. These processes involve a series of
sequential and reciprocal interactions between the thickened epithelial sheets
and underlying mesenchymal cells. Much has been learned from in vitro assays and 
knockout experiments in mice on the early signaling molecules that regulate the
initial stages of the epithelial/mesenchymal interactions. In this review, we
discuss effectors of these initial signals, specifically the p63 and Dlx families
of transcription factors, that play central roles in embryonic patterning and
regulation of different developmental processes, and provide a review of some of 
the mutations in these genes that have been associated with ectodermal dysplasias
(EDs).

PURPOSE: To characterize human limbal epithelial cells based on the expression
levels of nuclear protein p63 and the nucleus-to-cytoplasm (N/C) ratio.
METHODS: Limbal, peripheral, and central corneal epithelia were separated from
the stroma by Dispase II and subsequently were treated with trypsin to obtain
single-cell suspensions. Cytospin smears of the cell suspensions were double
immunostained for p63 and then stained for any one of the markers (acidic
cytokeratins [AE1], K5, K3, or connexin 43 [Cx43]). They were counterstained with
propidium iodide. More than 100 cells from each zone were analyzed for p63
expression levels and nuclear/cellular area using quantitative confocal
microscopy.
RESULTS: A gradient of p63-positive cells was observed in corneal and limbal
epithelial cells. The percentage of p63-positive cells and the level of p63
expression were significantly higher in the limbal than in the peripheral or
central corneal epithelium. Two-parameter (p63 levels and N/C ratio) analysis
revealed the presence of a distinct population of small cells with higher levels 
of p63 and a large N/C ratio in the limbal epithelium. Such limbal epithelial
cells were positive for AE1 and K5 but negative for K3 and Cx43.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that this distinct group of small cells in the
limbal epithelium with greater N/C ratio, expressing high levels of nuclear
protein p63, probably represent corneal epithelial stem cells.

The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) has a critical role in
malignant transformation. Consistent with its antiapoptotic role, the IGF-IR gene
is overexpressed in most types of cancer, including colorectal tumors. The
recently identified p53 homologues, p63 and p73, exhibit some of the biological
properties of p53, including the ability to transactivate p53-responsive genes
and to induce apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that
p63/p73 proteins may contribute to colon cancer cell proliferation via
mechanism/s that involve regulation of IGF-IR gene expression. Using transient
co-expression assays in colon cancer-derived HCT116 cells, we showed that both
proteins inhibit IGF-IR promoter activity and endogenous IGF-IR levels in a
dose-dependent manner, whereas mutant proteins are significantly impaired in
their ability to suppress IGF-IR gene expression. These results are compatible
with the notion that disruption of p63/p73-mediated signal transduction pathways 
in colon cancer may lead to increased IGF-IR gene transcription. In summary, we
have identified the IGF-IR gene as a novel downstream target for p63/p73 action.

PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence that cancer stem cells contribute to tumor 
progression and chemoresistance in a variety of malignancies, including brain
tumors, leukemias, and breast carcinomas. In this study, we tested the hypothesis
that retinoblastomas contain subpopulations of cells that exhibit cancer stem
cell properties.
METHODS: The following sources of retinoblastoma cells and tissues were examined 
for the presence of stem cell markers by immunocytochemistry: retinoblastoma
tumors from mice transgenic for the SV40 T-antigen (driven by the
beta-luteinizing hormone promoter), cell pellets of human Y79 and WERI-Rb27
retinoblastoma cell lines, and archival human retinoblastoma pathological
specimens. Hoechst dye exclusion, mediated by the stem cell surface marker ABCG2 
(ATP-binding cassette transporter, G2 subfamily), was assessed by flow cytometry 
in mouse tumors and WERI-Rb27 cells.
RESULTS: Small numbers of retinoblastoma cells (less than 1%) exhibited
immunoreactivity to stem cell markers ABCG2, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1),
MCM2 (minichromosome maintenance marker 2), SCA-1 (Stem cell antigen-1), and p63.
Hoechst dye uptake in mouse tumors and WERI-Rb27 cells was enhanced by addition
of 50 microM Verapamil, consistent with activity of the calcium-sensitive ABCG2
protein. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the presence of small subpopulations 
of cells excluding Hoechst dye in mouse retinoblastoma tumors (0.3%) and
WERI-Rb27 cells (0.1%) in a verapamil-sensitive manner. ABCG2 and ALDH1 positive 
cells were Hoechst-dim, as seen by dual labeling in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Mouse and human retinoblastoma tumor cells contain a small
subpopulation of cells that exhibit a cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Especially
significant is the expression of ABCG2 in mouse and human tumor cells, a
calcium-sensitive cell surface protein that not only acts to exclude Hoechst dye,
but also confers resistance to over 20 different chemotherapeutic agents. These
findings point to a heterogeneity in retinoblastoma tumors that may have
significant impact on future treatment strategies.

Medicine, Davis, CA 95817, USA.

PURPOSE: The expression pattern of p63, a homologue of the transcription factor
p53, and whether it can be used as a corneal epithelial stem cell specific marker
remain controversial. We investigated the p63 expression pattern in cultured
limbal epithelial cells at different time points in culture, in sparse and
confluent cultures, after growth factor starvation, and in single-cell-derived
colonies.
METHODS: Harvested limbal epithelial cells were plated at 2.5 (sparse) or 5
(dense) x 10 cells/cm and evaluated for p63 expression at day 1, day 4, day 7,
after starvation for 72 hours, or in colonies derived from single cells.
Expression of corneal lineage specific differentiation marker keratin 3 (K3) was 
correlated with p63 expression. Results were compared by 1-way ANOVA.
RESULTS: More than 85% (85%-90%) of cells expressed p63 on day 1 regardless of
cell plating density. On day 4, sparsely plated cultures were subconfluent and
demonstrated high p63 expression (87.4%), whereas densely plated cells were
confluent and had markedly reduced p63 expression (16.9%). Starvation of
subconfluent cultures arrested cell division but did not decrease p63 expression.
High-p63-expressing cultures expressed low levels of K3, and this trend was
reversed in confluent cultures. Most cells in all colonies derived from single
cells expressed p63.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of corneal limbal epithelial cells express p63 in
colonies derived from single cells and in subconfluent cultures regardless of
time in culture or continuance of cell division. This suggests that p63
expression in culture cannot be used as a marker for stem cells. Significantly
reduced number of cells express p63 in confluent cultures, associated with
increased cell-cell contact. It is notable that these cells continue to express
p63 amid areas of increased cell-cell contact several days after cultures have
attained full confluency. This may represent a unique subpopulation of cells that
retain proliferative potential in a confluent culture and may be analogous to a
subpopulation of stem cells present in vivo.

Loss of p63 and cytokeratin 5/6 expression is associated with more aggressive
tumors in endometrial carcinoma patients.

p63 and cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 are markers of basal and squamous differentiation in
several normal epithelia and human tumors and are also suggested to be markers of
progenitor or stem cells in certain stratified epithelia. In endometrial
carcinoma, there is very limited information about the expression pattern of p63 
or CK5/6 and no prognostic information. The aim of our study was to examine
whether the expression of these markers was associated with a certain tumor
phenotype in terms of other biomarkers, clinicopathologic characteristics and
patient prognosis. Immunohistochemical expression of p63 and CK5/6 was examined
using tissue microarrays (TMAs) in a large population-based series of 276
endometrial carcinomas with long and complete follow-up. Selected cases of normal
and hyperplastic endometrium were examined for comparison (n = 15). Absence of
p63 expression (70%) was significantly associated with nonendometrioid
carcinomas, high histologic grade (FIGO), higher mitotic count and tumor cell
proliferation by Ki-67, microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of hMSH6
expression. A tendency toward reduced patient survival was also seen (p = 0.098).
Presence of CK5/6 expression was more frequent in endometrioid tumors with
squamous differentiation, while loss of CK5/6 expression (54%) was significantly 
associated with high FIGO stage, reduced beta-catenin expression, MSI and reduced
patient survival (p = 0.0001); the latter was also found within the endometrioid 
subgroup (p = 0.0004). Multivariate survival analysis revealed that loss of CK5/6
expression had an independent prognostic impact in addition to well-known
prognostic variables. Expression of both markers was increased in simple
hyperplasia compared with normal endometrium. In complex hyperplasia, p63
expression was also increased, whereas CK5/6 was positive in areas with squamous 
differentiation only. Thus, loss of p63 or CK5/6 was associated with features of 
aggressive tumors, and lack of CK5/6 was significantly associated with reduced
survival in multivariate analysis.

Primary adenosquamous carcinoma of the jejunum.

University, Chengdu, China.

Adenosquamous carcinomas of the small intestine are extremely rare, with only
three documented jejunal and three ileal cases being reported in the
English-language medical literature. Presented herein is a case of primary
jejunal adenosquamous carcinoma in an 80-year-old woman. The jejunal carcinoma
consisted predominantly of a squamous component throughout the tumor but
peritoneal nodules carrying metastases from the adenocarcinoma element were
noted, making it the first case of jejunal adenosquamous carcinoma with
metastases from the adenocarcinoma component. The finding that metastases could
arise from the minor component of a jejunal adenosquamous carcinoma indicates
that an accurate diagnosis must be based upon thorough examination of both the
primary and the metastases, not just mesenteric nodule biopsy alone. Histological
foci of closely intermingled squamous and glandular components with apparent
morphological transition were noted, indicating the pathogenetic possibility that
the squamous component might arise by transformation from the glandular element. 
The squamous component was strongly positive with immunostaining for p63 (nuclear
staining) and for cytokeratin 10/13 (cytoplasmic staining), while the
adenocarcinoma element was negative. The immunohistochemical results suggest that
p63 and cytokeratin 10/13 might be useful in identifying squamous differentiation
in jejunal carcinoma.

The pathologic distinction of small cell from non-small cell-lung carcinoma is of
considerable therapeutic significance. In particular, the ability to distinguish 
poorly differentiated non-small-cell lung cancer from small-cell lung carcinoma
(SCLC) is at times difficult based upon morphology alone; available
immunohistochemical markers such as neuroendocrine markers are of limited
utility. We have demonstrated the role of p63 and thyroid transcription factor-1 
(TTF-1) in the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous-cell
carcinoma (PDSCC) versus SCLC, mostly in biopsy samples (Wu et al., American
Journal of Clinical Pathology 2003;119:696-702). Here, we examine further the
utility of this panel in cytologic cell-block samples of lung cancers including
both primary and metastatic cancers of pulmonary origin, and cases of
nonpulmonary cancers metastatic to lung in which differential diagnoses included 
a lung primary.Four-micron thick sections of 30 alcohol-fixed paraffin-embedded
cell blocks from 14 lung FNAs, 6 liver FNAs, 3 bronchial washings, 1 subcarinal
lymph node FNA, 1 iliac lymph node FNA, 1 pelvic mass FNA, 1 neck lymph node FNA,
1 adrenal FNA, and 1 pleural effusion were deparaffinized and stained with
monoclonal antibodies reactive to p63 (1:800, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and TTF-1
(1:50, Dako). Slides were stained for p63 using a streptavidin-biotin kit
(BioGenex) and diaminobenzidine as chromagen, and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Slides were stained for TTF-1 using a Dako Autostainer. Thirty cases
were examined, including 8 primary SCLCs, 8 extra-pulmonary metastases of lung
SCLCs, 4 PDSCCs and 4 primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas, and 6 nonpulmonary
adenocarcinomas metastatic to lung or other sites. Fifteen out of 16 (94%) SCLC
cases were p63-/TTF-1+, ranging in intensity from focal-weak to diffuse-strong;
1/16 SCLCs from a bronchial washing was p63-/TTF-1- but synaptophysin was
positive. All 4 primary lung adenocarcinoma cases were p63-/TTF-1+; contrasting
with nonpulmonary adenocarcinomas that were all p63-/TTF-1-. All 4 PDSCC cases
were p63+/TTF-1-. The panel of p63 and TTF-1 appears to be useful in the
diagnostic evaluation of cytologic cell-block samples of pulmonary malignancy.

Regulation of limbal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation by TAp63 and 
DeltaNp63 transcription factors.

PURPOSE: To examine the effects of TAp63 and DeltaNp63 on the proliferation and
differentiation of rabbit limbal keratinocytes cultured on human amniotic
membrane.
METHOD: Real-time Q-RT-PCR was used to quantify the relative abundance of TAp63
and DeltaNp63 transcripts in limbal, peripheral corneal, and central corneal
epithelia. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed specifically to suppress the 
expression of TAp63 or DeltaNp63 in limbal keratinocytes, and their effects on
cell proliferation and differentiation were examined. Immunofluorescence was used
to examine the expressions of p63 and keratin-3 and -14.
RESULTS: The expressions of TAp63 and DeltaNp63 transcripts appeared to be site
specific. TAp63 was expressed at the highest level in limbus, decreased by
approximately 10-fold in peripheral cornea and was undetectable in the central
cornea. DeltaNp63 was also expressed at the highest level in limbus, decreased by
approximately 35% in peripheral cornea, and was undetectable in the central
cornea. Suppression of TAp63 expression inhibited limbal keratinocyte
proliferation but promoted differentiation. Suppression of DeltaNp63 expression
also inhibited cell proliferation but had no obvious effect on cell
differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: TAp63 and DeltaNp63 affect the proliferation of limbal keratinocytes
by a different mechanism. The inhibition by TAp63 antisense oligos appeared to be
secondary to the promotion of cell differentiation. In contrast, the inhibition
by DeltaNp63 antisense oligos appeared to be independent of cell differentiation.

We report on a new patient with clinical findings consistent with
acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome. The child had sparse hair,
extensive freckling, lacrimal duct stenosis, oligodontia, dystrophic nails,
reduced sweating, and bilateral athelia. Examination of his hands showed ulnar
ray hypoplasia with bilateral fifth finger brachydactyly and camptodactyly. He
also had surgical repair of an imperforate anus. Mutation analysis of TP63 showed
a single nucleotide substitution, c.G518A, predicting a novel missense mutation, 
p.V114M in exon 4. This is the third mutation to be reported in TP63 in ADULT
syndrome.

BACKGROUND: The p63 gene is present as two isoforms, namely TAp63 and deltaNp63. 
The biological role of deltaNp63 in the progression of esophageal cancer is still
controversial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of deltaNp63, as well as that of p63, was
immunohistochemically examined in 61 resected specimens of squamous cell
carcinoma of the esophagus.
RESULTS: The incidences of a positive deltaNp63 expression were 32 and 64% in
carcinomas with and without adventitial invasion, respectively, and 37 and 65% in
those with and without lymph node metastasis, respectively (p<0.05). The
prognosis was significantly better in the positive deltaNp63 group than in the
negative group (p<0.01). However, a multivariate analysis revealed deltaNp63 not 
to be an independent prognostic factor. Regarding p63, diminished expression was 
more frequently observed in advanced carcinomas, however, there were no
statistically significant differences.
CONCLUSION: The impaired deltaNp63 reflects the progression of squamous cell
carcinoma of the esophagus.

To determine the association between the expression of p63 gene isoforms (TA and 
DeltaN) and salivary gland tumorigenesis, we performed reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of these markers in 71 benign
and malignant salivary gland neoplasms. The results were correlated with the
expression of Notch ligand JAG1 gene and the clinicopathologic features and the
full-length p63 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Both p63 isoforms
were either negative or weakly expressed in normal salivary gland tissues. TAp63 
was highly expressed in most benign tumors and was either negative or weakly
positive in most carcinomas. Conversely, DeltaNp63 was negative or faintly
positive in most benign neoplasms and was highly expressed in adenoid cystic,
mucoepidermoid, and myoepithelial carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis using 
anti-full-length p63 protein showed ubiquitous nuclear staining in basal and
myoepithelial cells in both benign and malignant neoplasms. JAG1 was expressed in
most benign and malignant tumors and did not correlate with p63 isoforms
expression. We conclude that (1) p63 isoforms are differentially expressed in
most benign and malignant tumors and may play distinct biological roles in
certain salivary gland neoplasms; (2) p63 immunostaining do not correlate with
the isoforms expression; and (3) isoform-specific antibodies are required for
better cellular localization and biological correlations.

The p63 gene, a homolog of the tumor suppressor gene TP53, maps to chromosome
3q27-28, a region frequently displaying genomic amplification in squamous cell
carcinomas. p63 is expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues and has been
reported to be critical for the normal development of stratified epithelia,
including skin epidermis. In a previous study, the authors reported the
expression of p63 in occasional cells in the germinal center of lymph nodes and
also observed p63 expression in B-cell lymphomas, among other tumor types
surveyed in that analysis. The present study was conducted to further analyze the
potential clinical significance of identifying p63 expression, assessing a larger
cohort of well-characterized patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
(n = 172 cases) and a panel of established lymphoma cell lines. p63 expression at
the microanatomic detail was examined by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal 
antibody (clone 4A4), while distinction of p63 isoforms was analyzed by Western
blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using
isoform-specific primers. The authors found that a subset of DLBCL (32% of cases)
expressed p63 in the nuclei of neoplastic lymphocytes. Examination of the
different p63 isoforms revealed that the DeltaNp63 species was expressed by only 
one cell line, while the other p63 isoforms were found in most cell lines
analyzed. The authors also observed that p63 expression correlated with high
proliferative index, as assessed by Ki-67 immunostaining. Even though in
univariate analysis p63 expression did not correlate with overall survival, the
association of p63 with increased proliferative index suggests its involvement in
DLBCL tumor progression.

A total of 123 cases of odontogenic cysts, distributed as follows: 30 follicular 
(FC), 35 radicular (RC), 53 keratocysts, 1 glandular odontogenic and 4 calcifying
odontogenic cysts, were analysed by immunohistochemistry for expression of p63, a
component of p53 protein family. In RCs p63 positivity was not only in basal and 
parabasal layers but also in the intermediate layer and about 1/3 of cases
displayed a percentage of stained cells comprised between 0 and <5%, and about
2/3 between >5% and <50%. In FCs positivity was confined to basal and parabasal
layers of the epithelium and in the majority of FCs the stained cells were
comprised between 0 and <5%. OKCs displayed the most intense and diffuse p63
labeling. In conclusion, these data suggest that p63 expression may be useful to 
identify cysts type with more aggressive and invasive phenotype supporting the
hypothesis of a suprabasal proliferative compartment in OKCs.

BACKGROUND: Adenomyoepithelial tumours and myoepithelial carcinomas of the breast
are primarily defined by the presence of neoplastic cells with a myoepithelial
immunophenotype. Current classification schemes are based on purely descriptive
features and an assessment of individual prognosis is still problematic.
METHODS: A series of 27 adenomyoepithelial tumours of the breast was analysed
immunohistochemically with antibodies directed against various cytokeratins, p63,
smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) and vimentin. Additionally, double
immunofluorescence and comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) was performed.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemically, all the tumours showed a constant expression of
high molecular weight cytokeratins (Ck) Ck5 and Ck14, p63, SMA and vimentin. With
exception of one case diagnosed as myoepithelial carcinoma, all tested tumours
expressed low molecular weight cytokeratin Ck18 in variable proportions of cells.
Even in monophasic tumours lacking obvious glandular differentiation in
conventional staining, a number of neoplastic cells still expressed those
cytokeratins. Double immunofluorescence revealed tumour cells exclusively
staining for Ck5/Ck14 in the presence of other cell populations that co-expressed
high molecular weight Ck5/Ck14 as well as either low molecular weight Ck8/18 or
SMA. Based on morphology, we assigned the series to three categories, benign,
borderline and malignant. This classification was supported by a stepwise
increase in cytogenetic alterations on CGH.
CONCLUSION: Adenomyoepithelial tumours comprise a spectrum of neoplasms
consisting of an admixture of glandular and myoepithelial differentiation
patterns. As a key component SMA-positive cells co-expressing cytokeratins could 
be identified. Although categorisation of adenomyoepithelial tumours in benign,
borderline and malignant was supported by results of CGH, any assessment of
prognosis requires to be firmly based on morphological grounds. At present it is 
not yet clear, if and to what extent proposed Ck5-positive progenitor cells
contribute to the immunohistochemical and morphological heterogeneity of these
neoplasms of the breast.

AIM: To investigate agreement on core biopsy diagnosis of papillary breast
lesions, which is acknowledged as a difficult area, and to determine the effect
of the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assist diagnosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections of 129 core biopsies of
papillary breast lesions were circulated to four observers who categorized each
case as: B2 (benign), B3a (epithelial proliferation, probably benign but
requiring biopsy), B3b (epithelial proliferation with cytological or
architectural atypia), B4 (probably malignant but insufficient material or
artefact to allow diagnosis), B5 (malignant papillary lesion). In all cases (n = 
127) IHC was performed for cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, calponin, p63 (myoepithelial
markers), and slides recirculated.
RESULTS: There was unanimous agreement in 44% of cases on H&E only which rose to 
91% after the use of IHC. Overall, unweighted kappa (Ku; five categories) rose
from 0.54 to 0.91. The main effect of IHC was to reduce the use of intermediate
categories (B3a, B3b and B4) and allow definitive diagnosis (B2 or B5).
CONCLUSION: Agreement on H&E sections alone in papillary core biopsies of breast 
is only 44% (Ku = 0.54) but is significantly increased to 91% (Ku = 0.91) by the 
use of IHC for CK5/6, calponin and p63.

Cell cycle-dependent nuclear retention of p53 by E2F1 requires phosphorylation of
p53 at Ser315.

We show here that the cell cycle-dependent DNA-binding and transcriptional
activity of p53 correlates with E2F expression in human primary fibroblasts. E2F1
binds and stimulates DNA-binding, transactivation and apoptotic functions of p53 
but not p63 and p73. E2F1 binds residues 347-370 of p53 and enhances nuclear
retention of Ser315 phosphorylated p53. This regulation of p53 by E2F1 is cell
cycle dependent, as the cellular distribution of Ser315 phosphorylated p53 is
associated with the periodic expression of E2F and cyclin A throughout the cell
cycle. This is the first demonstration that the activities of p53 are regulated
during the cell cycle by E2F/p53 interactions and that phosphorylation of p53 at 
Ser315 is required for this regulation.

BACKGROUND: The p63 and p73 genes are members of the p53 family and play an
important role in stem cell identity and cellular differentiation and are
expressed in basal and myoepithelial cells. In this study, we examined the
expression of p63 and p73 in 50 various benign salivary gland lesions and 45
malignant salivary gland tumors.
METHODS: The 95 salivary gland tumors were selected from the archives of the
Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Hospital of the University
of Pennsylvania. Sectioned formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue cut at 3 mum
was immunostained with antibodies that recognize all isozymes of p63 and p73 and 
evaluated with respect to percentage of positive cells and localization.
RESULTS: In benign lesions, p63 and p73 nuclear reactivity was seen in 46 (92%)
of 50 and 47 (94%) of 50 cases, respectively. In malignant tumors, p63 and p73
were seen in 34 (76%) of 45 and 40 (89%) of 45 cases, respectively. A significant
difference between p63 and p73 positivity was only seen in adenoid cystic
carcinomas (p = .006). Also, p73 was found in tumors with minimal
basal/myoepithelial differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Hence, p63 and p73 expression is retained in both benign and
malignant salivary gland tumors with basaloid or myoepithelial differentiation.
Hence, p63 seems to be a more specific marker of myoepithelial differentiation
than p73.

BACKGROUND: p63 is a homologue of the tumour suppressor gene p53, which is
expressed in human basal squamous epithelium. Some investigators maintain that
p63 plays a role in the development of squamous epithelium and, despite its
homology to p53, it is considered to act as an oncogene. This study investigated 
the expression of p63 in conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia of different
grades, and conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma and its correlation to the
proliferation marker MIB-1.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen conjunctival specimens excised with the suspicion
of either conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous cell carcinoma
were diagnosed histologically as follows: 2 squamous cell carcinomas of the
conjunctiva, 2 CIN grade I, 3 CIN grade II, 7 CIN grade III, 2 CIN with beginning
invasion and 1 normal conjunctiva with no dysplasia. Sixteen
microscopically-normal postmortem conjunctival specimens and normal conjunctiva, 
CIN and carcinoma specimens were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies
against p63 and MIB-1. At least 500 cells per specimen were counted and the
percentage of positively-stained cells of each antibody was calculated.
RESULTS: A mean of 80% (57-89%) of the dysplastic cells from the CIN specimens
stained positively with antibodies against p63, especially in the lower
two-thirds of the epithelium, statistically significantly more compared with the 
normal specimens (9-55%, mean 36%, p<0.001). Nevertheless, we did not find a
correlation between the percentage of p63-positive cells and the differentiation 
grade of the malignant specimens. MIB-1 positivity was shown by 0-1% of the cells
in the normal postmortem controls, by 3-30% (mean 12%) of the cells in the basal 
and occasionally in the middle layer of the CIN specimens, and 16-61% (mean 23%) 
in the carcinoma specimens.
CONCLUSION: In conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma
of the conjunctiva, p63 is preferentially expressed in the immature dysplastic
epithelial cells. Its staining does not correlate with MIB-1-expression, and
therefore does not appear to be linked to cell proliferation.

The p53 protein plays a pivotal role in determining the quality of the response
to DNA damage through its transcriptional activity. Upon DNA damage, p53 is
activated by post-translational modifications, binds its cognate sequences on the
promoters of its target genes and stimulates transcription. In proliferating
keratinocytes, the activity of p53 is blunted by its inhibitor DeltaNp63alpha.
Here, we describe a novel mechanism through which DeltaNp63 functions in order to
prevent the survival and propagation of ultraviolet (UV)-damaged keratinocytes.
We found that UVB stimulation induces the rapid phosphorylation of DeltaNp63,
which precedes DeltaNp63 transcriptional downregulation and protein degradation, 
which is mediated by the p38 MAPK. Phosphorylated DeltaNp63 has a lower affinity 
for p53REs and detaches from cell cycle arrest and apoptotic promoters, thus
allowing the rapid activation of p53-dependent transcriptional apoptotic program.

p63 plays unique developmental roles in epidermal morphogenesis, despite its
structural similarity with p53. The p63 gene has two distinct promoters, coding
for proteins containing an N-terminal transactivation domain (TA isoforms) and
for proteins lacking this region (DeltaN isoforms). The full-length
transcriptionally active TAp63 isoforms are capable of transactivating the
majority of the p53 target promoters thus inducing cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. On the contrary, the DeltaNp63 isoforms seem to counteract the
transactivation activities of p53 and TAp63 proteins, thus possibly conferring a 
proliferative advantage to cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms
controlling the transcriptional activity of p63 remain largely unclear. Here we
present data indicating that (i) the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML)
physically interacts with p63, (ii) p63 is localized into the PML nuclear-bodies 
(PML-NBs) in vivo, and (iii) PML regulates p63 transcriptional activity. We show 
that the interaction of p63 with PML increases the levels of p63 in cultured
cells as well as its ability to transactivate the p53-responsive elements of the 
GADD45, p21 and bax promoters. These data are consistent with a general role for 
PML as a functional modulator of all the p53 family members. Our findings
strengthen the relevance of the cross talk between PML and the p53 family
members, imply a new tumour suppressive function of PML and unveil a possible
role for PML in epidermal morphogenesis and differentiation.

The discovery of two new p53 homologs, p73 and p63, has defined a family of
transcription factors heavily involved in the control of growth suppression,
apoptosis, differentiation and development. While p53-deficient mice undergo
spontaneous tumors, p73 and p63 knockout mice exhibit severe developmental
defects. We demonstrate here that p73 gene is an in vivo transcriptional target
of the muscle regulatory factors MyoD, myogenin, Myf5 and Myf6. Ectopic
expression of the transcriptional repressor deltaEF1/ZEB/zfhx1a counteracts
MyoD/Myf5- or MyoD/Myf6-mediated transcriptional activation of p73. A distinct
pattern of in vivo recruitment of muscle regulatory factors and deltaEF1 on p73
regulatory regions was found between proliferating and differentiating muscle
cells. We also found that deltaEF1 plays a role in the transcriptional regulation
of p53 family members during keratinocytic differentiation. Mouse embryo
fibroblasts derived from deltaEF1-deficient mice exhibit unbalanced expression of
DeltaNp63, TAp73 and DeltaNp73 but not of TAp63 and p53. The analysis of tissues 
derived from deltaEF1+/- mice exhibit a selective enrichment of DeltaNp63 in
skin.

Breast ducts contain two types of epithelial cells, inner luminal cells and outer
basal/myoepithelial cells. These cells can be distinguished by their
immunophenotype. Cytokeratins (CKs) 8 and 18 are expressed in the luminal layer, 
whereas CK5/14 and the transcription factor p63 characterize the basal epithelial
layer. We studied a population-based cohort of 288 sporadic ductal invasive
cancers and found 9% positive for CK5/14 and 4% positive for p63. Using a highly 
sensitive polymer-based immunohistochemical staining, all sporadic tumors were
positive for the luminal CK8/18, including those positive for CK5/14. Pairs of
primary tumors and metastases (n = 38) were always concordant for CK5/14
expression. The majority of the CK5/14-positive cases were of histologic grade
III (P = 0.0007) and steroid hormone receptor negative (P < 0.0001). CK5/14
expression was inversely associated with HER-2 oncogene amplification, but only
in the subgroup of estrogen receptor-negative tumors (P = 0.007). In a separate
set of 42 hereditary breast cancers, the majority (78%) of the BRCA1-associated
tumors, but only one of 15 BRCA2-associated tumors was positive for CK5/14. In
contrast to sporadic CK5/14-positive tumors, BRCA1-associated tumors displayed
less intense CK8/18 staining, including some truly CK5/14-positive
CK8/18-negative cases. These results suggest that CK5/14-positive sporadic breast
cancers arise from glandularly committed progenitor cells rather than true
CK8/18-negative basal cells.

The p53-related p63 gene encodes six isoforms with differing N and C termini.
TAp63 isoforms possess a transactivation domain at the N terminus and are able to
transactivate a set of genes, including some targets downstream of p53.
Accumulating evidence indicates that TAp63 plays an important role in regulation 
of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, whereas
transactivation-inert deltaNp63 functions to inhibit p63 and other p53 family
members. Mutations in the p63 gene that abolish p63 DNA-binding and
transactivation activities cause human diseases, including ectrodactyly
ectodermal dysplasia and facial clefting (EEC) syndrome. In this study, we show
that mutant p63 proteins with a single amino acid substitution found in EEC
syndrome are DNA binding deficient, transactivation inert, and highly stable. We 
demonstrate that TAp63 protein expression is tightly controlled by its specific
DNA-binding and transactivation activities and that p63 is degraded in a
proteasome-dependent, MDM2-independent pathway. In addition, the N-terminal
transactivation domain of p63 is indispensable for its protein degradation.
Furthermore, the wild-type TAp63gamma can act in trans to promote degradation of 
mutant TAp63gamma defective in DNA binding, and the TA domain deletion mutant of 
TAp63gamma inhibits transactivation activity and stabilizes the wild-type TAp63
protein. Taken together, these data suggest a feedback loop for p63 regulation,
analogous to the p53-MDM2 feedback loop.

p63 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor gene family, which regulates
downstream target gene expression by binding to sequence-specific response
elements similar to those of p53. By using oligonucleotide expression microarray 
analysis and analyzing the promoters of p63-induced genes, we have identified
novel p63-specific response elements (p63-REs) in the promoter regions of EVPL
and SMARCD3. These p63-REs exhibit characteristic differences from the canonical 
p53-RE (RRRCWWGYYY) in both the core-binding element (CWWG) as well as the RRR
and/or YYY stretches. Luciferase assays on mutagenized promoter constructs
followed by electromobility shift analysis showed that p53 preferentially
activates and binds to the RRRCATGYYY sequence, whereas p63 preferentially
activates RRRCGTGYYY. Whereas EVPL protein is highly expressed in epithelial
cells of the skin and pharynx in the p63+/+ mouse, it is undetectable in these
tissues in the p63-/- mouse. Our results indicate that p63 can regulate
expression of specific target genes such as those involved in skin, limb, and
craniofacial development by preferentially activating distinct p63-specific
response elements.

Isoforms of DeltaNp63 and the migration of ocular limbal cells in human corneal
regeneration.

The p63 gene generates transactivating and N-terminally truncated transcripts
(DeltaNp63) initiated by different promoters. Alternative splicing gives rise to 
three different C termini, designated alpha, beta, and gamma. In the ocular
epithelium, the corneal stem cells, which are segregated in the basal layer of
the limbus, contain the alpha isoform but not beta or gamma. Holoclones derived
from the limbus are rich in alpha, meroclones contain little, and paraclones
contain none. In normal resting corneal epithelium, p63 of all isoforms is
absent. Upon corneal wounding, cells originating from the limbus and containing
alpha migrate progressively through the epithelium of the peripheral and central 
cornea. In the absence of an attached limbus, no alpha isoform appears in the
corneal epithelium. When migrating cells containing the alpha isoform appear in
the wounded corneal epithelium, they are confined to the basal layer, but the
suprabasal cells, not only of the cornea but of the limbus as well, contain mRNA 
encoding beta and gamma. These data support the concept that the alpha isoform of
p63 is necessary for the maintenance of the proliferative potential of limbal
stem cells and their ability to migrate over the cornea. The beta and gamma
isoforms, being suprabasal and virtually absent from the resting limbus, are not 
stem cell markers but are likely to play a role in epithelial differentiation
specifically during the process of corneal regeneration.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, yet there exists 
a limited view of the genetic lesions driving this disease. In this study, an
integrated high-resolution survey of regional amplifications and deletions,
coupled with gene-expression profiling of non-small-cell lung cancer subtypes,
adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC), identified 93 focal copy-number
alterations, of which 21 span <0.5 megabases and contain a median of five genes. 
Whereas all known lung cancer genes/loci are contained in the dataset, most of
these recurrent copy-number alterations are previously uncharacterized and
include high-amplitude amplifications and homozygous deletions. Notably, despite 
their distinct histopathological phenotypes, adenocarcinoma and SCC genomic
profiles showed a nearly complete overlap, with only one clear SCC-specific
amplicon. Among the few genes residing within this amplicon and showing
consistent overexpression in SCC is p63, a known regulator of squamous-cell
differentiation. Furthermore, intersection with the published pancreatic cancer
comparative genomic hybridization dataset yielded, among others, two focal
amplicons on 8p12 and 20q11 common to both cancer types. Integrated DNA-RNA
analyses identified WHSC1L1 and TPX2 as two candidates likely targeted for
amplification in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung
cancer.

p63, a member of the p53 superfamily, is an essential cell fate determinant for
stratified epithelium. Deficiency of p63 leads to lack of differentiated
epithelium from the skin and the presence of trace undifferentiated cells left in
the dermis. We found that transcriptionally active isoforms of p63, TAp63beta and
TAp63gamma, activated the skin-specific promoter of bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 
(BPAG-1). The p63-response element was localized between bases -177 and -153
upstream of exon 1 in the BPAG-1e promoter, whereas regions surrounding the
response element suppressed transcriptional responses to p53 and TAp73beta,
resulting in p63-specific activation of the promoter. This represents a novel
molecular mechanism by which target gene induction by p63 is distinguished from
induction by other p53 family members.

DeltaNp63 (DNp63) has become widely used, in particular, for distinguishing
invasive carcinomas from noninvasive ducts by highlighting the myoepithelial or
basal cells in the breast and prostate, respectively. It is not known whether
this marker may have any application in another exocrine organ, the pancreas. As 
the ductal and intraductal proliferations of this organ become better
characterized, the need for markers to distinguish among these processes
increases. We investigated immunohistochemical expression of DNP63 in 105 cases. 
A total of 25 cases were non-neoplastic pancreata, 25 were pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) of various grades, and 50 were examples of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Sections of non-neoplastic pancreata included
various types of non-neoplastic processes such as squamous/transitional
metaplasia (five cases), which can be mistaken for high-grade PanINs, as well as 
various degrees of reactive ductal atypia and incidental microcysts with
attenuated lining (five cases). No DNp63 expression was noted in normal
pancreatic ducts. On the other hand, all five foci of squamous/transitional
metaplasia were strongly and uniformly positive for this marker. DNp63 labeling
was also noted in those incidental microcysts lined by attenuated cells, seen
amidst normal pancreatic lobules. All PanINs were negative. Among invasive
carcinomas, DNp63 expression was detected only in areas of squamous
differentiation and was completely absent in ordinary ductal areas. Based on this
observation, five additional cases of adenosquamous/squamous carcinoma was
retrieved and stained, and the squamous components of all of these were also
positive. In conclusion, (I) DNp63 is a reliable marker of squamous
differentiation in the pancreas. It is valuable in distinguishing
squamous/transitional metaplasia from PanINs, a distinction of importance for
both researchers and diagnosticians. Among invasive carcinomas, it seems to be
entirely specific for areas of squamous differentiation. (II) Those incidental
microcysts seen in acinar lobules and lined by attenuated cells are also positive
for DNp63, which suggests that they may be metaplastic in nature, and that they
do not represent neoplastic cells. (III) Unlike the ducts of other exocrine
organs, breast and prostate, there are no DNp63-expressing cells in the normal
pancreatic ducts, and therefore, this marker cannot be used in distinguishing
invasive carcinomas from the non-invasive ducts. (IV) No p63-expressing 'stem'
cells are present in the pancreas.

The process of stratified epithelial development depends upon a transcriptional
program directed by the p53-related transcription factor p63. p63 is required for
the commitment of the ectoderm to stratification and for the completion of
terminal differentiation in stratified epithelia, and mutations in p63 have been 
identified in multiple developmental disorders affecting ectoderm-derived
tissues. Recent work from our laboratory has determined that the p53 target gene 
Perp is required for the integrity of the stratified epithelia specified by p63, 
and that expression of Perp in these structures depends on the presence of p63.
In these tissues, Perp is a critical component of the desmosome, a cell-cell
adhesion complex whose constituents are frequently mutated in human diseases
affecting the skin and hair. Perp's position downstream of p63 and p53, as well
as its essential role in normal desmosome function, suggest that it, like other
adhesion proteins, may be a target for mutation in human blistering diseases or
cancer.

The transcriptional co-activator p300 has been reported to regulate the tumor
suppressor p53 and its ortholog p73. Here we describe a study showing that this
coactivator also regulates the transcriptional function of p63. p300 bound to the
N-terminal domain of p63gamma, and p63gamma bound to the N terminus of p300 in
vitro and in cells. p300, but not its acetylase-defective mutant AT2, stimulated 
p63gamma-dependent transcription and induction of p21 in cells, consequently
leading to G1 arrest. Inversely, the deltaN-p63gamma isoform as well as p300AT2
inhibited the induction of p21 by p63gamma. These results suggest that p300
regulates p63-dependent transcription of p21.

BACKGROUND: The typical form of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is a
double-layered ductal structure, but occasionally EMC presents as a predominant
solid growth of clear myoepithelial cells. In the current study, the authors
analyzed the distribution and visual patterns of p63-positive clear myoepithelial
cells in EMC.
METHODS: Six cases of EMC were evaluated with Papanicolaou staining and with p63 
and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) immunostaining. Furthermore, the expressions 
of p63 and SMA were compared.
RESULTS: The cytologic features of EMC were classified into two types-biphasic
and clear cell-dominant type. The biphasic type showed myoepithelial cells with
moderate or scant cytoplasm or naked nuclei, overlapping a cohesive cluster of
ductal cells. This biphasic type was similar to that in fibroadenoma of the
breast. The clear cell-dominant type consisted of myoepithelial cells with a
large amount of fragile pale cytoplasm or naked nuclei. In this type, there were 
many clusters of myoepithelial cells without ductal cells. Nuclear
immunoreactivity to p63 was expressed clearly in both biphasic and clear
cell-dominant types. Cytoplasm immunoreactivity to SMA was expressed in many
myoepithelial cells in the clear cell-dominant type, but only in myoepithelial
cells with moderate cytoplasm in the biphasic type.
CONCLUSIONS: Clear myoepithelial cells in EMC were distributed in various
patterns. The authors concluded that p63 is an especially useful marker of
myoepithelial cells with naked nuclei in EMC.

DeltaNp63 is an isoform of the p53 homologue p63, which lacks an amino-terminal
transactivation domain and antagonizes the induction of the gene expression by
Deltap63. The aim of this study was to detect the DeltaNp63 expression in lung
cancer using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and to evaluate the relationship
between theDeltaNp63 expression level and the prognosis based on resected lung
cancer tissues specimens from the of patients. We used immunohistochemistry to
analyze the protein expression of DeltaNp63 in paraffin-embedded tumor samples
from 161 well-characterized squamous cell carcinoma patients and compared the
expression level of DeltaNp63, clinical variables and the survival outcome.
Seventy-seven patients (47.8%) showed positive staining for DeltaNp63 in the
nuclei of tumor cells. No significant difference was observed between the
DeltaNp63 expression and the gender, age at operation, pathologic stage,
pathologic T status, and pathologic N status. Based on the actuarial survival
method, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test, the DeltaNp63 expression was 
not associated with survival for lung cancer. Differences in survival remained
insignificant even after lung cancer patients were stratified according to stage 
or differentiation. The prognostic effects of DeltaNp63 expression do not appear 
to act as an important prognostic indicator in lung cancer. Our findings do not
support that immunocytochemical markers demonstrate a relevant prognostic role in
lung cancer.

TP63, an important epithelial developmental gene, has significant homology to
p53. Unlike p53, the expression of p63 is regulated by two different promoters
resulting in proteins with opposite functions: the full-length transcriptionally 
active TAp63 and the dominant-negative DeltaNp63. We investigated the downstream 
mechanisms by which TAp63alpha elicits apoptosis. TAp63alpha directly
transactivates the CD95 gene via the p53 binding site in the first intron
resulting in upregulation of a functional CD95 death receptor. Stimulation and
blocking experiments of the CD95, TNF-R and TRAIL-R death receptor systems
revealed that TAp63alpha can trigger expression of each of these death receptors.
Furthermore, our findings demonstrate a link between TAp63alpha and the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. TAp63alpha upregulates expression of
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members like Bax and BCL2L11 and the expression of
RAD9, DAP3 and APAF1. Of clinical relevance is the fact that TAp63alpha is
induced by many chemotherapeutic drugs and that inhibiting TAp63 function leads
to chemoresistance. Thus, beyond its importance in development and
differentiation, we describe an important role for TAp63alpha in the induction of
apoptosis and chemosensitivity.

p63 is the identity switch for uterine/vaginal epithelial cell fate, and
disruption of p63 expression by diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces cervical/vaginal
adenosis in mice. In this article, we report the expression patterns of p63
isoforms (TA, DeltaN, alpha, beta and gamma) in mice, focusing on the
reproductive tract. We also present the reproductive tract phenotype of female
p63-/- mice. Finally, to better evaluate the potential role of p63 in human
development of DES-induced cervical/vaginal adenosis, we describe the ontogeny of
p63 in human female fetuses. In adult mice, the DeltaN isoforms of p63 were
expressed only in squamous/basal/myoepithelial cells of epithelial tissues, while
TA isoforms of p63 were highly expressed in germ cells of the ovary and testis.
In fetal mice, the DeltaN and alpha forms of p63 were expressed in the cloacal
and urogenital sinus epithelia. In the female p63-/- mice, the sinus vagina
developed, but p63-/- sinus vaginal epithelium failed to undergo squamous
differentiation confirming an essential role of p63 in squamous epithelial
differentiation. Although TAp63 was highly expressed in developing primordial
germ cells/oocytes, p63-/- ovaries and oocytes developed normally. The ontogeny
of p63 in female reproductive organs was essentially identical in mouse and
human. In the human fetus at the susceptible stage for DES-induced
cervical/vaginal adenosis, most cervical/vaginal epithelial cells were columnar
and negative for p63. Therefore, inhibition of p63 expression by DES should
change the cell fate of human Müllerian duct epithelial cells and cause
cervical/vaginal adenosis as previously demonstrated in mouse.

Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is a well-defined lymphoma entity whose
molecular pathogenesis is incompletely understood and also lacking
well-established diagnostic markers. Recently, the presence of overlapping
features between classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and primary mediastinal large
B-cell lymphoma was highlighted by gene expression profiling as well as
morphological studies. We investigated the expression of TP73L (commonly known as
p63) isoforms in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma at both protein and
mRNA level, and demonstrated the exclusive presence of transactivating (TA)
isoforms in all cases. We also demonstrated that TP73L is expressed in a subset
of germinal center B-cells, as well as in some diffuse large B-cell lymphomas,
but it is never present in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Nodular lymphocyte
predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma also showed TP73L positivity by
immunohistochemistry. Isoform analysis by real-time PCR showed that TA-TP73Lalpha
is the most represented in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, but
TA-TP73Lgamma is the most differentially expressed in comparison to both germinal
center B-cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. TP73L expression proved a
useful diagnostic marker of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and gave
new insights in to the molecular pathways playing a role in this lymphoma.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a worldwide disease. In South Asians, the 
high prevalence of OSCC is tightly linked to areca chewing. The prognosis for
OSCC remains dismal and improvement in early diagnosis may benefit the survival
of patients with this disease. Chromosome region 3q26-27 has been shown to carry 
several oncogenes. By quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), the gene copy numbers of TERC,
PI3KCA, ZASC1, and TP63 from microdissected OSCCs have been determined. Copy
number amplifications of PI3KCA and ZASC1, a newly identified zinc finger
transcription factor, were identified in 30 (65%) and 32 (70%) of 46 primary
OSCCs, respectively. Co-amplification of PI3KCA and ZASC1 in 50% of primary OSCCs
suggests that they are critical targets of the 3q26.3 amplicon. OSCCs carrying
higher levels of PI3KCA and/or ZASC1 copy number amplification were associated
with a significantly higher propensity for lymph node metastasis. ZASC1 mRNA
expression in OSCC was also associated with lymph node metastasis. In addition,
copy number amplification of at least one 3q26-27 oncogene was detected in brush 
samples from 10 of 22 (45%) patients with oral leukoplakia and 5 of 20 (25%) oral
mucosa samples from areca chewers without a visible lesion. These data indicate
frequent copy number amplification and overexpression of ZASC1 in OSCC. The
findings also suggest the potential use of Q-PCR analysis and brush collection of
samples to dissect OSCC risk.

PURPOSE: To determine the protein and mRNA expression of p53, p63, and p73 in
central and peripheral human corneal endothelial cells. Since these proteins are 
known to be involved in the regulation of cell division, this study seeks
information about their influence in regulating cell proliferation in the human
corneal endothelium.
METHODS: Human donor corneas were separated into central and peripheral sections.
The endothelial tissue from these samples was dissected and samples were analyzed
for mRNA transcription of p53, transactivating p63 (TAp63), delta N p63
(DeltaNp63), transactivating p73 (TAp73), and delta N p73 (DeltaNp73) via the
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additional samples were
analyzed for p53, p63, and p73 protein expression via SDS-PAGE, western blotting,
and immunodetection. Frozen corneal sections were immunostained for p53 and
analyzed via fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: p53 and TAp63 mRNA and protein expression were detected in central and
peripheral human corneal endothelium. p53 and TAp63 protein expression were
greater in central than in peripheral tissue. DeltaNp63 and all isoforms of p73
were not detected in either central or peripheral corneal endothelium.
CONCLUSIONS: p53 is expressed in both peripheral and central human corneal
endothelium, although it is more highly expressed in the central endothelium.
Similarly, TAp63 is more highly expressed in central rather than in peripheral
endothelium. This suggests that the peripheral endothelium may have more
potential for cell division than the central endothelium. DeltaNp63, a stem cell 
marker, was not detected in the corneal endothelium. Neither the TAp73 nor the
DeltaNp73 isoforms were detected in either central or peripheral human corneal
endothelium.

p63 is a p53-related gene mapping to 3q28 that codes for multiple mRNA
transcripts with (TA-p63) or without (DeltaN-p63) transactivating effects on
genes that promote cell differentiation and apoptosis. We analysed p63
alterations by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and FISH in a 
series of 45 follicular lymphomas (FL). None of the tumours showed
immunoreactivity for the p40 antibody, which recognizes only the truncated
isoforms of p63, or DeltaN-p63 mRNA expression. Immunoreactivity for the 4A4
antibody, which recognizes both the transactivating and the truncated p63
isoforms, was found in 5 +/- 5.5%, 6.85 +/- 4.88% and 33.2 +/- 22.31% of grade I,
II and III FL cells, respectively (p < 0.0001). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
showed that all cases but one had TA-p63 mRNA levels higher than non-neoplastic
lymphocytes, and that TA-p63 mRNA expression correlated significantly (r =
0.9194, p < 0.0001) with the prevalence of p63 immunoreactivity. FISH extra
signals for the p63 gene were found in seven (23.3%) of the 30 cases analysed
(0/6 grade I, 2/15 grade II and 5/9 grade III; p = 0.01937). Further
hybridizations showed a pattern highly suggestive of chromosome 3 polysomy in six
cases. One of these cases also bore extra copies of the p63 and bcl-6 genes.
Co-localization of p63 and IgH signals was found in one case. No association
between the prevalence of p63 immunoreactivity and extra p63 gene signals was
detectable when the cases were dichotomized according to a p63 immunoreactivity
threshold of 10%. Our data suggest that TA-p63 is overexpressed in high-grade FL,
possibly independent of the occurrence of gene abnormalities, and that it may be 
involved in the highly complex mechanism of regulation of apoptosis of FL cells.

The soluble p51 antigen alone, or in combination with the soluble p66 (as a
preparation of the soluble tumour-associated antigens, sTAA) was shown to be
useful in both cancer detection, prevention and therapy.CANCER DETECTION: In
colon cancer patients with recurrent cancer, the blood level of p51 increased
whereas the blood level of p66 did not change. The correlation and regression
coefficients between the serum level of p51 protein and the progress in colon
cancer were 0.48 and 0.88, respectively. In patients with melanoma, development
of metastases significantly increased the blood levels of p51. The method was
shown to be highly sensitive (92 to 96%) and moderately specific (42 to 65%) for 
the detection of different types of cancer, such as of the colon, uterus, ovary
and breast, as well as melanoma.
CANCER PREVENTION AND THERAPY: This was performed using a preparation of both p66
and p51 antigens. sTAA have both tumour-preventive and tumour-suppressive effects
on chemically-induced cancers of the colon, skin and mammary glands in rats and
mice. sTAA promote suppression of rat mammary tumours by different anticancer
drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen and 5-fluorouracil. This effect was
shown to be connected with activation of the host's immune system, especially
that which is responsible for the activity of T and B lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: We propose the follow-up of cancer patients in order to verify, as
early as possible, recurrent cancer and perform preventive therapy of suspect
cancer patients with their own sTAA as a kind of autoimmunotherapy. Moreover, in 
combination with anticancer drugs, sTAA may serve as a new tool in prevention of 
the toxic side-effects of chemotherapy.

Some cytological aspects of rat mammary cancer therapy with soluble
tumor-associated antigens (sTAA- p66 and p51) and the anticancer drug
cyclophosphamide (CPA) are analyzed. Vaccination with sTAA results in a
significant increase in the areas related to the production of T and B cells in
the white pulp (germinal center and PALS) and in the marginal zone of the spleen.
sTAA stimulate the production of CD8+ lymphocytes inside the tumors and in bone
marrow, and of CD8+ thymocytes in the medulla of the thymus. Treatment of rats
with CPA decreases the activity of lymph cells in tumors, especially of CD4+
lymphocytes. In the spleen, CPA decreases the size of areas related to the
production of B and T cells. In the bone marrow, CPA affects the process of
myelogenesis and causes significant substitution of cellular components with
fatty tissue. The combined treatment with CPA and sTAA increases the number of
lymph cells and the apoptotic index in tumors, and restored the rate of B cells
producing in the spleen. Similar effect was observed in lymph nodes with
accumulation of B lymphocytes in the primary and secondary follicles, and of T
lymphocytes in the paracortical zone. In the thymus, CPA alone or in combination 
with sTAA repairs the inhibitor effect of a carcinogen on synthesis of CD4+ and
CD8+ thymocytes. In combined using with CPA, sTAA activate the B- and
T-lymphocyte production in the host's immune system and decrease the toxic
side-effects of a drug.

Resistance to radio- and chemotherapy is a major problem in treatment responses
of lung cancer. In this disease, biological markers, that can be predictive of
response to treatment for guiding clinical practice, still need to be validated. 
Radiotherapy and most chemotherapeutic agents directly target DNA and in response
to such therapies, p53 functions as a coordinator of the DNA repair process, cell
cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In fact, it participates in the main DNA repair
systems operative in cells, including NHEJ, HRR, NER, BER, and MMR. Given the
high p53 mutation frequency in lung cancer which likely impairs some of the
p53-mediated functions, a role of p53 as a predictive marker for treatment
responses has been suggested. In this review, we summarize the conflicting
results coming from preclinical and clinical studies on the role of p53 as a
predictive marker of responses to chemotherapy or radiotherapy in lung cancer.

The transcriptionally active forms of p73 are capable of inducing apoptosis, and 
the isoforms termed TAp73 are important players when E2F and its oncogenic
activators induce programmed cell death. However, the conditions under that TAp73
can kill a cell remain to be clarified. Recently, it has been found that p73
proteins are not merely floating in the nucleoplasm but rather can associate with
specific compartments in the cell. Examples of intranuclear compartments
associated with p73 proteins include the PML oncogenic domains and the nuclear
matrix. In addition, p73 is found in the cytoplasm. It remains to be seen whether
p73 might also associate with mitochondria, in analogy with p53. The
relocalization of p73 is expected to be mediated by specific binding partners,
mostly other proteins. Here, we discuss the possibility that the
compartmentalization of p73, and the cooperation with the corresponding binding
partners, might decide about its apoptosis-inducing activity.

p63 and p73 show a high degree of structural homology to p53 and are members of a
family of transcriptional factors that can activate transcription of
p53-responsive genes. p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers, whereas
p63 and p73 are rarely mutated. Studies of knockout mice also revealed an
unexpected functional diversity among the p53 family. To determine how p63 and
p73 are involved in tumorigenesis and normal development, we used cDNA microarray
to examine 9216 genes in human colorectal cancer cells. We discovered that the
expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) was specifically induced
by either p63 or p73, but not by p53. We also report here that the PEDF gene
contains a response element specific for p63 and p73 in its promoter region and
is a direct target of p63 and p73. Collectively, p63 and p73 may be involved in
cell fate by inducing PEDF expression.

DeltaNp63alpha, a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, acts as a
transcriptional repressor with dominant negative effects towards p53.
Additionally, DeltaNp63alpha is overexpressed in a number of squamous cell
carcinomas, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis. However, the mechanisms
regulating p63 have yet to be elucidated. The goal of the current study was to
determine the effect of various genotoxic stresses on DeltaNp63alpha
posttranslational modification and stability in normal and transformed squamous
epithelial cells. We found that DeltaNp63alpha protein levels decreased after
ultraviolet radiation and paclitaxel treatment of both normal and transformed
cells. After UV and paclitaxel treatment, DeltaNp63alpha phosphorylation was
significantly modulated. Additionally, DeltaNp63alpha protein levels were
regulated in a proteasome-dependent manner in control and UV treated cells with
increased DeltaNp63alpha ubiquitination after UV treatment or proteasome
inhibition. Our studies provide insight to a mechanism for DeltaNp63alpha
regulation during normal cell proliferation and, in particular, after stress.
Further, the inverse regulation of p53 and DeltaNp63alpha protein levels after
cell stress through opposing regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation may
allow for rapid transcriptional changes of specific target genes that are
consistent with the roles of these family members in tumor suppression and cell
growth.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein functions via specific gene activation to
inhibit passage through the cell cycle and to trigger apoptosis. The p53 protein 
is homologous to p63 and p73, proteins that regulate transcription via the same
promoter sequences but which activate different genes. In this study we tested
whether p53, p63, and p73 have different mechanisms of activating transcription
and if such a difference could explain how each factor stimulates the
transcription of distinct sets of genes. We found that when comparing p53 to the 
transcriptional activator, GAL4-VP16, both of which are classified as acidic
activators, that stimulation of transcription by p53 is dependent upon low Mg2+
concentrations and limiting amounts of extract. By comparison, the stimulation of
RNA synthesis by GAL4-VP16 was not dependent on a specific concentration of Mg2+ 
but did require higher amounts of extract, suggesting that a certain factor not
required for p53-dependent gene activation was limiting in the extract. In
contrast to the differences between p53 and GAL4-VP16, p63 and p73 both regulated
transcription in vitro under similar conditions as did p53. All three proteins,
purified to near homogeneity, were equally active in binding to the p53-response 
element, and equally active in stimulating transcription reactions using naked
DNA templates, DNA templates reconstituted in chromatin using histones purified
from HeLa cells, or hyper-acetylated histones. These results argue that the gene 
specificity of p63 and p73 dependent activation of transcription depends upon
specific coactivators present in the specific cell types and upon other factors
bound to the promoters.

The mechanism through which cutaneous papillomaviruses induce lesions is largely 
unknown. Ectopic expression of the DeltaNp63alpha isoform highly increased the
viral promoter activity. The co-expression of c-Jun mediated and increased the
DeltaNp63alpha activity by binding to the AP-1 site in an enhancer region of the 
HPV 20 URR. This strong activation by DeltaNp63alpha is diminished in the
presence of wtp53 and abolished by the simultaneous expression of "hot-spot"
mutant p53 R248W. We demonstrate that c-Jun is responsible for the viral promoter
activation through its direct interaction with both DeltaNp63alpha and wtp53. The
downregulation by p53 mutant R248W is accompanied by reduced protein levels of
DeltaNp63alpha and phosphorylated c-Jun. The data presented in this study provide
insight into a possible mechanism through which these cellular proteins may
modulate a cutaneous papillomavirus genome to induce viral replication, latent
infection or malignant transformation.

Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a genetically heterogeneous limb
malformation that may be isolated or associated with other malformations. More
than 50 recognizable entities with SHFM have been described and at least 5 mapped
genetic loci have been implicated. Two brothers with intrauterine growth
retardation, short stature, distinctive face, microphthalmia, genital anomalies, 
and SHFM are described. Molecular analyses of TP63, HOXA13, and HOXD13 genes were
normal. We propose this pattern to be a newly recognized SHFM syndrome.

The FLI-1 transcription factor is a member of the ETS gene family, most closely
related to ERG. In this study, the FLI-1 protein products were characterized
using a specific monoclonal antibody previously developed against bacterially
expressed protein. In the human T-cell line Jurkat, both isoforms of FLI-1, p51
and p48, are phosphorylated, primarily on serine residues. FLI-1 phosphorylation 
is increased by a Ca(2+)-mediated process, and inhibitor studies indicate that
protein phosphatase 2A, at least in part, controls FLI-1 phosphorylation level.
FLI-1 phosphorylation is not stimulated by phorbal 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),
a protein kinase C activator, and in this it differs from ERG protein
phosphorylation. The p51 isoform has a half-life of 105 min, and p48 has a
half-life of 80 min; in contrast, the ERG protein is much more stable with a
half-life of 21 h. Newly synthesized FLI-1 protein decreased during human T cell 
activation. Our data suggest that although the FLI-1 and ERG genes are highly
homologous, their distinct properties may contribute to their different roles in 
gene regulation.

Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by
ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/cleft palate. Very recently, mutations in p63 
have been identified as a cause of RHS; to date five such mutations have been
identified. We describe a Thai girl with RHS. She had short stature, ectodermal
dysplasia, epiphora, cleft lip, cleft palate, and normal development. Mutation
analysis for the entire coding region of p63 identified a novel and de novo
mutation, 1622C--> A (S541Y), in the SAM domain, predicting an abnormal alpha
tail of the p63alpha protein isotypes. This observation supports that majority of
patients with RHS are caused by mutations affecting the tail of p63alpha, a
region that also contains most of the pathogenic mutations in
ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC) syndrome.

IGFBP-3 is a direct target of transcriptional regulation by DeltaNp63alpha in
squamous epithelium.

DeltaNp63alpha is a nuclear transcription factor that maintains epithelial
progenitor cell populations, is overexpressed in several epithelial cancers, and 
can negatively regulate apoptosis. However, the mechanisms by which
DeltaNp63alpha promotes cell survival are unclear. DeltaNp63alpha has been
reported to act as a transcriptional repressor, but specific target genes
directly repressed by DeltaNp63alpha remain unidentified. Here, we present
evidence that DeltaNp63alpha functions to negatively regulate the proapoptotic
protein IGFBP-3. Disruption of p63 expression in squamous epithelial cells
increases IGFBP-3 expression, whereas ectopic expression of DeltaNp63alpha
down-regulates IGFBP-3. DeltaNp63alpha binds to sites in the IGFBP-3 gene in vivo
and can modulate transcription through these sites. Furthermore, DeltaNp63alpha
and IGFBP-3 expression patterns are inversely correlated in normal squamous
epithelium and squamous cell carcinomas. These data suggest that IGFBP-3 is a
target of transcriptional repression by DeltaNp63alpha and that this repression
represents a mechanism by which tumors that overexpress p63 may be protected from
apoptosis.

The concept that corneal epithelium stem cells reside in limbus has been
recognized for more than a decade, but isolation of these stem cells has not been
accomplished. This study was an initial attempt to isolate a population of human 
limbal epithelial cells enriched for certain putative stem cell properties based 
on their phenotype. Epithelial cells harvested from fresh human limbal rings and 
their primary cultures were allowed to adhere to collagen IV-coated dishes for 20
min and 2 hr, sequentially. The rapidly adherent cells (RAC), slowly adherent
cells and non-adherent cells were evaluated for certain stem cell properties: (a)
BrdU-label retention, (b) expression of basal cell (integrin beta1, p63, ABCG2)
and differentiation (involucrin, keratin 12) markers, and (c) colony forming
efficiency (CFE) and growth capacity on a 3T3 fibroblast feeder layer. Among
unfractionated cells and the three selected populations, the RAC, accounting for 
about 10% of whole population, were enriched 5-fold in BrdU label-retaining
cells, displayed the highest number of integrin beta1 and p63 positive and
involucrin negative cells, expressed high levels of DeltaNp63 and ABCG2 mRNA, and
lacked involucrin and K12 expression, and possessed the greatest CFE and growth
capacity. These findings demonstrated for the first time that human limbal
epithelial cells with stem cell properties can be partially enriched by their
adhesiveness to collagen IV. The RAC population enriched for certain putative
stem cell properties may prove useful in the future for transplantation to
diseased and damaged corneas with limbal stem cell deficiency.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive role of S100-positive dendritic cells,
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1) and p63 gene in laryngeal
carcinoma using a tissue chip.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression of dendritic cells, TIMP1 and p63 gene in a 
series of 85 primary laryngeal carcinoma patients who had undergone operations in
our hospital between 1992 and 2000 was studied immunohistochemically using the
streptavidin-biotin peroxidase-conjugated method.
RESULTS: Some cases were lost or showed no tumor tissue in the tissue chip. The
rate of expression of dendritic cells was 59.5% and there were significant
differences in expression between the differential degrees of laryngeal squamous 
carcinoma and the different clinical stages (p <0.05). The basal membrane and
extracellular matrix of the specimens were strongly stained by TIMP1 in 55.7% of 
cases. There were statistically significant correlations between TIMP1 protein
expression and early- and advanced-stage tumors, lymph node metastasis and 3-year
survival rate (p <0.05). No statistically significant correlations were found
between p63 protein expression and any of the clinical parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The tissue microarray technique used in this study is quick,
inexpensive and very consistent. It is suggested that TIMP1 and S100 should be
used as clinical discriminators of laryngeal carcinoma.

Antonio, 78229-3900, USA.

We evaluated 25 intraductal papillomas and 18 papillary carcinomas (invasive, 4; 
micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], 5; cases originally classified as
intracystic/intraductal papillary carcinoma, 9) by calponin, smooth muscle myosin
heavy chain (SMM-HC), and p63 immunostains. Calponin, SMM-HC, and p63 labeled
myoepithelial cells (MECs) in all intraductal papillomas and all micropapillary
DCIS cases. The invasive papillary carcinoma cases were uniformly negative for
all stains. The 9 cases originally diagnosed as intracystic/intraductal papillary
carcinoma showed more variable results, with identification of an MEC layer in
only 4 cases. Comparison of staining of MECs by these 3 stains showed that
calponin was more sensitive and intense than SMM-HC; however, there was
cross-reactivity with myofibroblastic cells. Staining with p63 was discontinuous,
making interpretation of an intact myoepithelial layer difficult. Of 9 cases
originally classified as intraductal papillary carcinoma, 5 showed absence of a
basal MEC layer by immunohistochemical analysis. The lack of a basal MEC layer in
these cases suggests a spectrum of progression from in situ to invasive disease
and might help explain distant metastases from previously reported "intraductal
papillary carcinoma."

AIM: By using comparative genomic hybridization, gain of 3q was found in 45-86%
cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EC-SCC). Chromosome 3q25.3-qter is
the minimal common region with several oncogenes found within this region.
However, amplification patterns of these genes in EC-SCC have never been
reported. The possible association of copy number changes of these genes with
pathologic characteristics is still not clear.
METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed to analyze the copy
number changes of 13 candidate genes within this region in 60 primary tumors of
EC-SCC, and possible association of copy number changes with pathologic
characteristics was analyzed by statistics. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was 
also performed on another set of 111 primary tumors of EC-SCC to verify the
association between TP63 expression change and lymph node metastasis status.
RESULTS: The average copy numbers (+/-SE) per haploid genome of individual genes 
in 60 samples were (from centromere to telomere): SSR3: 4.19 (+/-0.69); CCNL1:
5.24 (+/-0.67); SMC4L1: 2.01 (+/-0.16); EVI1: 2.02 (+/-0.12); hTERC: 5.28
(+/-0.54); SKIL: 2.71 (+/-0.14); EIF5A2: 1.95 (+/-0.12); ECT2: 9.18 (+/-1.68);
PIK3CA: 8.13 (+/-1.17); EIF4G1: 1.07 (+/-0.05); SST: 3.07 (+/-0.25); TP63: 2.51
(+/-0.22); TFRC: 2.42 (+/-0.19). Four clusters of amplification were found: SSR3 
and CCLN1 at 3q25.31; hTERC and SKIL at 3q26.2; ECT2 and PIK3CA at
3q26.31-q26.32; and SST, TP63 and TFRC at 3q27.3-q29. Patients with lymph node
metastasis had significantly lower copy number of TP63 in the primary tumor than 
those without lymph node metastasis. IHC study on tissue arrays also showed that 
patients with lymph node metastasis have significantly lower TP63 staining score 
in the primary tumor than those without lymph node metastasis.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that different amplification patterns were seen
among different genes within 3q25.3-qter in EC-SCC, and several novel candidate
oncogenes (SSR3, SMC4L1, ECT2, and SST) were identified. TP63 is amplified in
early stage of EC-SCC carcinogenesis but down-regulated in advanced stage of
disease.

The p53 homologous squamous stem-cell regulatory protein p63 is expressed in
squamous carcinomas but is not characteristically detected in small-cell
carcinomas (SCCs). A panel of thyroid transcription factor (TTF) 1 and p63 has
been shown to be useful in distinguishing SCCs from poorly differentiated
squamous carcinoma of the lung (PDSLC) in small biopsies and cytological cell
blocks. Because tumor samples frequently are limited to cytological smears, we
attempted to detect p63 in destained slides from a spectrum of pulmonary
malignancies. Archival alcohol-fixed smears from 60 cases of cytologically
diagnosed malignancies in bronchoscopically (n = 59) or fine-needle
aspiration-obtained specimens (n = 1) were destained in acid alcohol, postfixed
in 10% formalin, subjected to citrate-based antigen retrieval, and immunostained 
by exposure to anti-p63 monoclonal antibody 4A4, followed by reagents from a
streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase kit, and diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. 
Postfixation in 10% formalin was found to be necessary for immunostaining. Normal
ciliated and goblet cells were p63 negative, but reserve cells were p63 positive.
All cases of squamous-cell carcinoma were positive for p63. Of 10 tumor samples
originally diagnosed as SCC, only 6 samples were p63 negative and 4 samples
exhibited positive staining. However, proper interpretation of the
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining pattern and careful scrutiny of the
cytological features and biopsy specimens in three of four cases led us to
reclassify three cases into PDSLC. All adenocarcinomas (ACAs; n = 12), large-cell
carcinomas (n = 4), and metastatic ACAs (n = 5) were p63 negative. Positive
staining was seen in 9/16 tumors designated as non-SCCs; these tumors were not
classified further into distinct histological categories.p63 staining in
destained slides may be of value in facilitating the differential diagnosis
between PDSLC and SCC. Criteria for conservative interpretation of results are
discussed and include examination of reserve cells and ciliated cells on the same
slide as internal positive and negative controls.

p63 belongs to a protein family that includes 2 structurally related proteins,
p53 and p73. The aim of this study was to investigate the biologic role of p63 in
oral tumorigenesis and its possible role as prognostic marker in oral cancer.
Ninety-four cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma and 10 cases of normal mucosa
were analyzed for p63 expression by immunohistochemistry. Normal oral mucosa
showed a basal and parabasal expression of p63. Five (5.3%) cases of oral cancer 
showed less than 10% of positive tumor cells; in 33 (35.1%) cases the positive
tumor cells comprised between 10% and less than 30%, in 36 (38.3%) cases the
positive tumor cells comprised between 30% and less than 50%, and in 20 (21.3%)
cases the positive tumor cells were more than 50%. There was also a statistically
significant correlation between p63 expression and tumor differentiation: p63
expression was amplified in poorly differentiated tumors (P < .05). When analyzed
for prognostic significance, patients with perineural infiltration had poorer
survival rates than the group with no perineural infiltration (P < .05) and
patients with increased p63 expression had poorer survival rates than the group
with reduced p63 expression (P < .05). The statistical analysis showed no
significant correlation between p63 expression, sex, age, tumor size, staging,
recurrence, and metastasis. Cases with diffuse p63 expression were more
aggressive and poorly differentiated and related to a poorer prognosis. These
data suggest that p63 expression may be useful to identify cases of oral squamous
cell carcinoma with more aggressive and invasive phenotype providing novel
diagnostic and prognostic information on individual patient survival with oral
cancers.

BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in the TP53 are regarded as the most consistent
findings in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Two related members of the TP53 family,
p73 and p63, have shown remarkable structural similarity to TP53, indicating
possible functional and biological interactions. The aim of the present study was
to investigate the expression of p63 protein and mRNA in oral epithelial
dysplasia.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical p63 staining was compared for samples from 90 male
patients with buccal epithelial dysplasias and 15 healthy individuals with normal
buccal mucosa and 15 subjects with reactive epithelial hyperplasia of the oral
mucosa secondary to traumatic insult. The buccal lesions consisted of mild,
moderate and severe epithelial dysplasias (30 samples in each category). The mRNA
expression using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
also included for a subset of available fresh tissue specimens (four samples in
each category of mild and moderate epithelial dysplasia; five samples in severe
epithelial dysplasia; five samples in each of normal and reactive epithelial
hyperplasia).
RESULTS: Nuclear p63 staining was demonstrated predominantly in the basal layers 
of the epithelium of the normal buccal mucosa and reactive epithelial hyperplasia
specimens. For epithelial dysplasia lesions, however, staining was not restricted
to the basal layers, extending to the middle spinous layer for samples in the
mild category, with p63 immunoexpression observed across almost the full
thickness of the dysplastic epithelium for analogous moderate and severe
specimens. Compared with normal/reactive hyperplastic mucosa, p63 staining in the
dysplastic mucosa was significantly increased. The severity of dysplasia was
increased with the increase of p63 staining. Furthermore, Delta Np63mRNA was
identified in all of the fresh tissue samples whereas expression of
transactivation (TA) isotype was not detected. A subset of moderate epithelial
dysplasia and severe variant showing p63-positive staining has undergone
malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinomas in about 5 years follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that impaired p63 immunoexpression
(predominantly Delta N isoform) is associated with the severity of oral
epithelial dysplasias and up-regulation of p63 may play a role in the early stage
of human oral tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND: To clarify the role of p53 homologs in oncogenesis and
cytodifferentiation of odontogenic tumors, expression of p63 and p73 was analyzed
in ameloblastomas as well as tooth germs.
METHODS: Tissue specimens of nine tooth germs and 48 benign and five malignant
ameloblastomas were examined by immunohistochemistry and reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the expression of p63 and
p73.
RESULTS: Immunoreactivity for p63 and p73 was evident in epithelial cells
neighboring the basement membrane in developing and neoplastic odontogenic
tissues. p63 expression in desmoplastic ameloblastomas was significantly higher
than in acanthomatous and granular cell ameloblastomas, and ameloblastic
carcinomas showed higher p63 expression than metastasizing ameloblastomas. p73
expression was significantly higher in plexiform ameloblastomas than in
follicular ameloblastomas, and basal cell ameloblastomas showed higher p73
expression than granular cell ameloblastomas. mRNA transcripts for Delta Np63 and
TAp73 were detected in all developing and neoplastic odontogenic tissues. TAp63
mRNA was expressed in five of eight tooth germs, 16 of 34 ameloblastomas, and one
of one malignant ameloblastoma, whereas Delta Np73 mRNA was recognized in one of 
eight tooth germs, nine of 34 ameloblastomas, and one of one malignant
ameloblastoma.
CONCLUSION: The expression of p63 and p73 suggests that these p53 homologs play a
role in differentiation and proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells.
Variations of predominantly expressed isoforms suggest that p63 and p73 might
differentially function in odontogenic tissues.

A 5-year-old boy with a history of a bifid uvula and a submucosal cleft palate
presented for evaluation of brittle nails. The physical examination demonstrated 
cup-shaped ears, a broad nasal root, thin upper lip, mid-facial hypoplasia,
coarse hair, and twenty-nail dystrophy. The clinical presentation of ectodermal
dysplasia with cleft palate was consistent with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome, which is
one of several allelic diseases associated with mutations in the TP63 gene. The
clinical manifestations of Rapp-Hodgkin as well as other ectodermal dysplasias
with clefting are discussed.

We studied p53, p63, p73 protein expression in the orofacial region of five human
embryos aged 7-18 weeks of intrauterine development using a three-step
immunohistochemical method. Expression of proteins in various locations was
evaluated semiquantitatively. A decrease in p53, p63 and p73 proteins occurred in
the 13-week-old material with the exception of the tooth germ where a drop in p73
appeared in the ninth week.

We report a Mexican boy with isolated ectrodactyly (split hand malformation) in
whom a new mutation was identified in exon 3 of the TP63 gene. In contrast to
previously reported patients with isolated split hand/foot anomaly and mutations 
in the DNA binding domain of Tp63, the mutation described herein induce an amino 
acid substitution (R97C) in the canonical transactivation (TA) domain. To our
knowledge, this is the first naturally occurring mutation described so far in
this part of the protein. Based on the genotype-phenotype correlation observed in
our patient, we hypothesize that integrity of the TA domain of Tp63 is critical
for normal limb development.

HSP70, a stress response protein, is known to be a determinant of cell death and 
cell transformation. We show that different isoforms of p63 have different
transcriptional activities on hsp70 genes. DeltaNp63alpha, an abundantly
expressed isoform of p63, activates (in vitro and in vivo), whereas TAp63gamma
down-regulates the expression of hsp70. We further show that the transactivation 
domain at the NH(2) terminus of p63 represses, whereas the COOH terminus
activates hsp70 transcription. In addition, DeltaNp63alpha regulates
transcription of the hsp70 gene through its interaction with the CCAAT binding
factor and NF-Y transcription factors which are known to form a complex with the 
CCAAT box located in the hsp70 promoter. Moreover, DeltaNp63alpha expression
correlates with HSP70 expression in all head and neck cancer cell lines. Finally,
we show colocalization of DeltaNp63alpha and HSP70 in the epithelium and
coexpression of both proteins in 41 primary head and neck cancers. Our study
provides strong evidence for the physiologic association between DeltaNp63alpha
and hsp70 in human cancer, thus further supporting the oncogenic potential of
DeltaNp63alpha.

Healing of skin wounds in mammals involves partial reconstruction of the dermis
and coverage of the injured site by keratinocytes. The latter process is achieved
by extensive migration and hyperproliferation of keratinocytes at the wound rim. 
Because the p53 protein family member p63 is expressed in human
hyperproliferative epidermis, this study determined whether enhanced keratinocyte
proliferation correlates with the expression of p63. Therefore, we investigated
the temporal and spatial distribution of four major variants of the p63
transcription factor-TAp63alpha, TAp63gamma, DeltaNp63alpha and
DeltaNp63gamma-during normal skin wound healing in mice. Transcripts encoding
amino-terminally truncated DeltaNp63 variants were found at high levels in basal 
and suprabasal keratinocytes of the hyperproliferative wound epithelium.
Interestingly, TAp63 variants, which include the conserved transactivation domain
TA at their amino-terminus, were also expressed in wound keratinocytes as well as
at the edge of the injured subcutaneous muscle panniculus carnosus. These
findings suggest splice-variant specific functions of p63 in reepithelialization 
and muscle repair.

Although the p53 family members share a similar structure and function, it has
become clear that they differ with respect to their role in development and tumor
progression. Because of the high degree of homology in their DNA binding domains 
(DBDs), it is not surprising that both p63 and p73 activate the majority of p53
target genes. However, recent studies have revealed some differences in a subset 
of the target genes affected, and the mechanism underlying this diversity has
only recently come under investigation. Our laboratory has demonstrated
previously that p53 represses transcription of the P-glycoprotein-encoding MDR1
gene via direct DNA binding through a novel p53 DNA-binding site (the HT site).
By transient transfection analyses, we now show that p63 and p73 activate rather 
than repress MDR1 transcription, and they do so through an upstream promoter
element (the alternative p63/p73 element (APE)) independent of the HT site. This 
activation is dependent on an intact DNA binding domain, because mutations within
the p63DBD or p73DBD are sufficient to prevent APE-mediated activation. However, 
neither p63 nor p73 directly interact with the APE, suggesting an indirect
mechanism of activation through this site. Most interestingly, when the p53DBD is
replaced by the p63DBD, p53 is converted from a repressor working through the HT 
site to an activator working through the APE. Taken together, these data indicate
that, despite considerable homology, the DBD of the p53 family members have
unique properties and can differentially regulate gene targeting and
transcriptional output by both DNA binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Post-translational modification of proteins by the ubiquitin-like molecule SUMO-1
regulates their stability and activity with crucial implications for many
cellular processes. Here we show that p63alpha, but not p63beta and gamma, is
sumoylated in vitro and in vivo at a single lysine residue, K637, in the post-SAM
domain. SUMO-1 attachment targets DeltaNp63alpha for proteasome mediated
degradation while it does not influence p63alpha intracellular localization, as
wild-type protein and a mutant carring the K637 mutated into arginine (K637R),
have the same nuclear localization. Four natural p63 mutations, falling within
the SAM and post-SAM domain of p63alpha, were found to be altered in their
sumoylation capacity. The transcriptional activities of the natural mutants and
of K637R were strongly increased compared to that of wild type p63, suggesting
that sumoylation has a negative effect on p63 driven transcription. The findings 
that DeltaNp63alpha protein levels are regulated by SUMO-1 and that this
regulation is altered in natural p63 mutants, suggest that SUMO conjugation to
p63 plays a critical role in regulating the biological activity of p63.

4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a product of lipid peroxidation, inhibits proliferation
of several tumor cells. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in
cell cycle control, by inducing p21 expression, and in apoptosis, by inducing bax
expression. Recently, two other proteins with many p53-like properties, TAp73
(p73) and TAp63 (p63), have been discovered. SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells
express the three p53 family proteins and can be used for the study of their
induction. We investigated HNE action in the control of proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in SK-N-BE cells and the HNE effect on the
expression of p53, p63, p73, p21, bax, and G1 cyclins. Retinoic acid (RA) was
used as a positive control. HNE inhibited cell proliferation without inducing
differentiation; it decreased S-phase cells and increased the number of apoptotic
cells. RA reduced the proportion of S-phase cells and did not induce apoptosis.
HNE increased p53, p73, p63, p21, and bax expression at different time points.
HNE reduced cyclin D2 expression and the phosphorylation of pRb protein. Our
results demonstrated that HNE inhibits SK-N-BE cell proliferation by increasing
the expression of p53 family proteins and p53 target proteins which modulate cell
cycle progression and apoptosis.

Abstract Epithelial appendages share a common developmental program that relies
on extensive interactions between epithelia and adjacent mesenchyme. The
transcription factor p63 has a critical role in epithelial appendage development 
in both vertebrates and non-vertebrates. Both mice and zebrafish lacking p63
expression fail to develop epithelial appendages and other structures that
develop as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Furthermore,
dominantly inherited mutations in p63 are the cause of a subset of human
ectodermal dysplasias, which are characterized by developmental abnormalities in 
epithelia and epithelial appendages. While the importance of p63 for epithelial
appendage development is evident, the molecular mechanisms by which p63 functions
are largely unknown. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge of the
developmental role of p63 and the implications for epithelial appendage
development.

By expressing two genes (hTERT and Cdk4), we have developed a method to
reproducibly generate continuously replicating human bronchial epithelial cell
(HBEC) lines that provide a novel resource to study the molecular pathogenesis of
lung cancer and the differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells. Twelve human
bronchial epithelial biopsy specimens obtained from persons with and without lung
cancer were placed into short-term culture and serially transfected with
retroviral constructs containing cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), resulting in continuously growing
cultures. The order of introduction of Cdk4 and hTERT did not appear to be
important; however, transfection of either gene alone did not result in
immortalization. Although they could be cloned, the immortalized bronchial cells 
did not form colonies in soft agar or tumors in nude mice. The immortalized HBECs
have epithelial morphology; express epithelial markers cytokeratins 7, 14, 17,
and 19, the stem cell marker p63, and high levels of p16(INK4a); and have an
intact p53 checkpoint pathway. Cytogenetic analysis and array comparative genomic
hybridization profiling show immortalized HBECs to have duplication of parts of
chromosomes 5 and 20. Microarray gene expression profiling demonstrates that the 
Cdk4/hTERT-immortalized bronchial cell lines clustered together and with
nonimmortalized bronchial cells, distinct from lung cancer cell lines. We also
immortalized several parental cultures with viral oncoproteins human papilloma
virus type 16 E6/E7 with and without hTERT, and these cells exhibited loss of the
p53 checkpoint and significantly different gene expression profiles compared with
Cdk4/hTERT-immortalized HBECs. These HBEC lines are a valuable new tool for
studying of the pathogenesis of lung cancer.

OBJECTIVES: p63, a p53 homologue, may be associated with tumorigenesis in
epithelial tissues through its inhibition of p53 transactivation functions. We
sought to determine the pattern and levels of p63 expression in oral dysplasias
and carcinomas using standard immunohistochemical staining. We also assessed and 
compared expression of p53 and a cell proliferation marker in these lesions.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cross-sectional survey (n=67) included
hyperkeratosis (10), mild dysplasia (9), moderate dysplasia (11), severe
dysplasia/in situ carcinoma (10), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (22 [9 well
differentiated, 7 moderately differentiated, 6 poor differentiated]), and normal 
mucosa (5). Serial sections were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies to
p63 (4A4 recognizing all p63 isotypes), p53 (DO-7), and Ki-67 (MIB-1) proteins.
In preinvasive lesions, both the percentage of positive cells and staining
patterns (negative, basal, suprabasal) were assessed. In oral SCCs, the
percentage of positive cells was assessed. Statistical analysis was done using
the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test.
RESULTS: A suprabasal p63 staining pattern was evident in keratinocyte nuclei in 
the entire range of noninvasive lesions studied, including normal mucosa. Most
nuclei in invasive SCCs stained positive. When all grades of dysplasia were
combined, the percent of p63 positive cells was significantly greater than
hyperkeratosis (P < .01), and well-differentiated SCC (P < .001). Moderately
differentiated SCC had statistically significant more positive cells than
well-differentiated SSC (P < .01). Comparison of serial sections showed different
p63 staining patterns compared to p53 or Ki-67 staining patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that p63 is expressed in oral carcinomas and dysplasias,
as determined by immunohistochemical staining with a primary antibody to all
isotypes. Neither staining pattern nor percentage of stained cells could be used 
to differentiate the lesions studied. The statistically significant differences
found between some groups are not likely to be of diagnostic value. p63 is not
coexpressed with p53 expression or Ki-67 suggesting functional independence. When
antibodies to the p63 isotypes become available, oral dysplasias and carcinomas
should be reassessed.

TAp63gamma can substitute for p53 in inducing expression of the maspin tumor
suppressor.

Maspin is a Class II tumor suppressor protein and plays a role in tumor growth by
inhibiting cellular invasion and motility. It is a member of the serpin family of
protease inhibitors and has been shown to reduce angiogenesis. Maspin gene
expression can be upregulated by the tumor suppressor p53. We tested 7
p53-related proteins of the p63 and p73 families for their ability to induce
maspin expression. The p63 splice form TAp63gamma can substitute for p53 in
activating the maspin promoter. TAp63gamma activates the promoter through the
same consensus site as p53. In the DLD-1 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line,
harboring a tet-off regulated transgene, induction of TAp63gamma leads to an
upregulation of maspin mRNA from the chromosomal gene. With a short lag phase
also maspin protein levels are elevated after induced TAp63gamma expression. To
assess a potential function of p63-dependent maspin upregulation in tumors we
followed expression of p53, p63 and maspin by immunohistochemistry in
hepatocellular carcinomas. Two types of tumors with wild-type or mutant p53 were 
assayed. Interestingly, the majority of tumors expressing only a mutated and
inactive p53 protein nonetheless stain positive for maspin, whereas these tumors 
were positive for p63 protein expression. In summary, we show that TAp63gamma can
substitute for p53 in transcriptional activation of the maspin tumor suppressor
gene. TAp63gamma employs the same DNA recognition site for this activation as
p53. We observe expression patterns of p53, p63 and maspin proteins in tumor
tissue that may indicate also a function of maspin induction by p63 in tumors.

AIMS: To study and compare the expression of p63 protein and smooth muscle actin 
in breast tubular carcinoma (TC) and its main differential diagnoses, radial scar
(RS)/complex sclerosing lesion (CSL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry techniques were used to search for
p63 protein and smooth muscle actin antibodies in 10 patients with TC and fifteen
with RS/CSL.
RESULTS: Myoepythelial cells were diffusely positive for both actin and p63
protein with a cytoplasmic (actin) or nuclear (p63) pattern in all patients with 
RS/CSL. Inversely, all TC were negative for p63. Actin antibodies failed to label
myoepithelial cells in TC, but both vessels and stromal myoblasts were
actin-positive, creating difficult interpretation situations. By contrast, p63
was consistently negative in these structures.
CONCLUSION: For the differential diagnosis between TG and CR/LSC, smooth muscle
actin and p63 protein demonstrate equivalent sensitivity for the detection of
myoepithelial cells. However, the nuclear pattern of p63 labeling gives a
"cleaner" stain. In addition, p63 enables distinction between myoepithelial cells
and myofibroblasts/vascular smooth muscle cells, offering increased specificity.

p63 is a recently discovered member of the p53 family that has been shown to be
important in the development of epithelial tissues. p63 may also play a role in
squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, head and neck, and cervix, and its
expression is increased in these tumors. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the expression of p63 in a broad spectrum of histologic types of lung
tumors. A total of 441 cases of primary lung tumors with follow-up data were
identified, and the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were used to construct a
duplicate core tissue microarray. After review of the tissue cores, 408 cases,
consisting of 123 squamous cell carcinomas, 93 adenocarcinomas, 68 large cell
carcinomas, 68 classic carcinoids, 31 atypical carcinoids, 11 large cell
neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 14 small cell carcinomas, were adequate for
analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed at 2 different laboratories using
monoclonal antibody 4A4 to detect the expression of p63, using different staining
protocols. p53 expression was also studied with immunohistochemistry using
monoclonal antibody DO-7. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare the
survival of p63-expressing versus nonexpressing tumors. A large proportion of
squamous cell carcinomas expressed p63 (96.9%), most showing strong positive
nuclear immunoreactivity. Expression in other nonsmall cell lung cancers was also
present. Thirty percent of adenocarcinomas and 37% of large cell carcinomas
showed p63 expression. In the neuroendocrine tumors, an increasing proportion of 
tumors stained for p63 as tumor grade increased; 1.9% of classic carcinoids,
30.8% of atypical carcinoids, 50% of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and
76.9% of small cell carcinomas were positive. Approximately half of the
positively staining neuroendocrine cases showed strong staining. Expression of
p63 was of prognostic significance in neuroendocrine tumors (P < 0.0001), with
higher-grade tumors more likely to express p63. Correlation between p63 and p53
expression was not observed (P = 0.18) in nonsmall cell lung cancer; however, a
significant correlation between the 2 markers was found in neuroendocrine tumors 
(P < 0.0001). p63 staining was repeated with a different staining protocol,
yielding similar results overall but a lower percentage of positive cases (34.2% 
vs. 48.4% of tumors positive). In conclusion, p63 expression is consistently
expressed in squamous cell carcinoma in the lung, but is also expressed in a
subset of adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas. Pulmonary neuroendocrine
tumors also show p63 staining in some instances, particularly in higher-grade
tumors, and the majority of small cell carcinomas are p63-positive. These results
suggest that p63 may be involved in oncogenesis in a broader range of tumors than
was previously thought.

Several ectodermal dysplasia syndromes have been shown to result from mutations
in the gene that encodes the transcription factor p63. We describe an 11-year-old
boy, with clinically normal parents, who had a developmental disorder that
resembled EEC (ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia-clefting) syndrome (OMIM
604292). He had ectrodactyly and missing middle fingers bilaterally,
onychodysplasia, hypodontia with missing teeth, hypohidrosis and lacrimal duct
obstruction. DNA sequencing disclosed a heterozygous G-->A substitution at
nucleotide 893, that converts an arginine residue (CGA) to glutamine (CAA), the
mutation being designated R298Q. This mutation occurs within the DNA-binding
domain of p63, and is close to many of the published EEC syndrome mutations.
However, R298Q has been described once previously in a large German pedigree, not
with EEC syndrome, but another ectodermal dysplasia disorder, ADULT
(acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth) syndrome (OMIM 103285). Further clinical
assessment in our patient revealed that, apart from not having cleft lip and/or
palate, he had an exfoliative dermatitis of his hands and feet, and some
freckling on his face and shoulders. Collectively, these features support a
diagnosis of ADULT syndrome. This study has identified a specific
genotype-phenotype correlation in a rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome and the
findings are useful in improving genetic counselling in this family.

The TP63 gene, a member of the TP53 gene family, encodes several isoforms with
(TAp63) or without (DeltaNp63) transactivating properties. Whereas the role of
p63 in the normal development of squamous epithelia is well established, its
function in other cell types remains to be elucidated. Here, we have analysed the
expression of TA and DeltaNp63 isoforms in liver cells, by using both primary
hepatocytes from wild type and p53-null mice and three human hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, according to the transformation state and the TP53
status of the cells. We observed the expression of DeltaNp63 isoforms only in a
p53-null context. On the other hand, the expression of TAp63 isoforms was
restricted to the HCC cell lines, whatever the TP53 status. We then studied the
expression of TP63 upon genotoxic treatment. When treated with UVB or H(2)O(2),
hepatocytes did not exhibit any change in p63 mRNA level. At the opposite, upon
treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors (doxorubicin or etoposide), the
expression of TAp63 isoforms was clearly induced, independently of the TP53
status of cells. The same treatment did not induce any variation in the
expression of DeltaNp63 isoforms, both at mRNA and protein levels. In HCC cell
lines, doxorubicin or etoposide treatment also resulted in an increase of TAp63
transcripts only. This increase was accompanied by an increase in the
intracellular level of TAp63 alpha protein. In parallel, we observed an
upregulation of some p53-target genes related to cell cycle regulation, such as
WAF1/CIP1, PIG3, 14-3-3sigma or GADD45, independently of the TP53 status of
cells. In conclusion, we report for the first time that TA and DeltaNp63 alpha
proteins are present in liver cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that p63
may partially substitute for wild-type p53, in counteracting uncontrolled liver
cell proliferation in response to certain forms of DNA-damage.

p63 mutations have been identified in several developmental abnormalities,
including split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM). In this study, we demonstrate that
the C-terminal domain of p63alpha associates with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating
enzyme, Ubc9. A p63alpha mutation, Q634X, which naturally occurs in SHFM
modulated the interaction of p63alpha with Ubc9 in yeast genetic assay.
Furthermore, Ubc9 catalyzed the conjugation of p63alpha with small ubiquitin
modifier-1 (SUMO-1), which covalently modified p63alpha in vitro and in vivo at
two positions (K549E and K637E), each situated in a SUMO-1 modification consensus
site (phiKXD/E). In addition, p63alpha mutations (K549E and K637E) abolished
sumoylation of p63alpha, dramatically activated transactivation properties of
TAp63alpha, and inhibited the dominant-negative effect of DeltaNp63alpha. These
p63alpha mutations also affected the transcriptional regulation of gene targets
involved in bone and tooth development (e.g., RUNX2 and MINT) and therefore might
contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying the SHFM phenotype.

P63, a homologue of p53, was recently identified as a useful basal cell-specific 
marker. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of p63 with the widely used
high-molecular-weight keratin 34betaE12 for the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma
in needle biopsies. We selected 100 consecutive prostate carcinoma diagnosed by
needle biopsies with an adequate number of cancerous glands on the slide. We
chose 1 representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide from each case and
gave it a Gleason score. The same paraffin block was retrieved for 34betaE12 and 
p63 stains. We compared staining patterns of 34betaE12 and p63 on both malignant 
glands and benign glands and recorded basal cell density (percentage of basal
cells with positive staining in the benign glands). The cases were divided into 3
groups according to the Gleason score: 5 to 6 (31 cases), 7 (46 cases), and 8 to 
10 (23 cases). In 20 cases, focal and patchy staining in a basal cell
distribution in malignant glands (range, 1%-20%; mean, 6.6%) was demonstrated (19
by both stains and 1 by 34betaE12 only). In 1 case with a Gleason score of 9, the
cancer cells, not the basal cells, were stained focally by p63 but not by
34betaE12. Higher-grade tumors demonstrated higher numbers of malignant glands
with basal cell staining (1.65% for Gleason 7, 1.26% for Gleason 8-10, compared
with 0.42% for Gleason 5-6). The overall specificity of the absence of basal cell
staining in the malignant glands for 34betaE12 and p63 was 98.63% and 98.60%,
respectively. In 17 cases, both stains revealed total absence of basal cell
staining in some benign glands (range, 1%-10%; mean, 3.5%). The overall
sensitivity in identifying basal cells in benign glands was 99.48% and 99.44% for
34beta12 and p63, respectively. Basal cell density was higher for 34betaE12 in
comparison with p63 (92% vs. 87%). For diagnosing prostate carcinoma in the
needle biopsies, p63 is as specific and sensitive Hospital as 34betaE12 and
therefore can be used as a complementary basal cell-specific stain for 34betaE12 
in difficult cases.

basaloid squamous cell carcinoma.

Morphologic distinction of high-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma from basaloid
squamous cell carcinoma can be difficult. Equivocal diagnoses can mislead
treatment. We have investigated the possibility that immunohistochemical staining
for the presence of p63, a novel epithelial stem-cell regulatory protein, could
be a useful means of distinguishing these two neoplasms. Archival, routinely
processed slides were subjected to citrate-based antigen retrieval, exposure to
anti-p63 monoclonal 4A4, and developed with a streptavidin-biotin kit and
diaminobenzidine as chromogen. p63 was detected in 100% of the adenoid cystic
carcinomas (n=14) and 100% of basaloid squamous cell carcinomas (n=16). Basaloid 
squamous cell carcinomas consistently displayed diffuse p63 positivity, with
staining of nearly 100% of tumor cells. In contrast, adenoid cystic carcinoma
displayed a consistently compartmentalized pattern within tumor nests.
Compartmentalization was manifested in two patterns: (1) selective staining of a 
single peripheral layer of p63-positive cells surrounding centrally located tumor
cells that were p63-negative and (2) tumor nests consisting of multiple
contiguous glandular/cribriform-like units of p63-positive cells surrounding or
interspersed with p63-negative cells. p63 immunostaining constitutes a specific
and accurate means of distinguishing adenoid cystic carcinoma from basaloid
squamous cell carcinoma. p63 positivity in adenoid cystic carcinoma appears to be
homologous to that seen in the basal and/or myoepithelial compartments of
salivary gland and other epithelia, and may signify a stem-cell-like role for
these peripheral cells. Diffuse p63 positivity in basaloid squamous cell
carcinoma suggests dysregulation of p63-positive stem cells in poorly
differentiated squamous carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of P504S immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis
and differential diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Light microscopy and immunohistochemistry examinations (EnVision
staining) were performed in 117 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, PIN, AAH,
ASAP, BPH and normal prostatic tissue to correlate the morphology and protein
expression of P504S, 34betaE12, and P63.
RESULTS: Seventy-one of the 78 (91%) cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma stained
positive for P504S, with strong cytoplasmic granular staining in most cases, and 
a weak or intense granular staining along the circumferential luminal and apical 
cell border membrane in a few cases. Negative P504S immunostaining was observed
in 7 of 78 (9%) cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, all of which were clear cell
type prostatic adenocarcinoma. Cases of PIN (9 cases), AAH (6 cases) and ASAP (2 
cases) showed various expression levels of P504S. Sixty-five of 68 (96%) cases of
normal prostates and BPH were negative for P504S and basal cell hyperplasia cases
were also negative.
CONCLUSIONS: P504S is a useful marker for microscopic diagnosis of prostatic
adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemistry study using a combination of P504S and
34betaE12/p63 may be of greater benefit in aiding the differential diagnoses.

metaplastic carcinoma.

p63, a member of the p53 gene family, is involved in cellular differentiation and
is expressed in the nuclei of myoepithelial cells of normal breast ducts and
lobules. Although p63 has been reported in metaplastic carcinomas of the breast, 
its expression pattern in breast carcinomas and sarcomas has not been fully
characterized, and its potential diagnostic utility has not been defined. In this
study, we determined p63 expression in a large number of breast carcinomas,
including metaplastic carcinomas, and in Phyllodes tumors and sarcomas. We
examined 189 invasive breast carcinomas, including 15 metaplastic carcinomas, as 
well as 10 Phyllodes tumors, and 5 pure sarcomas of the breast for pattern and
intensity of p63 staining using an anti-p63 antibody (clone 4A4, Neomarkers). p63
was strongly expressed in 13 of 15 metaplastic carcinomas (86.7%). p63 was
positive in all the metaplastic carcinomas with spindle cell and/or squamous
differentiation (12 of 12), and in 1 of 3 metaplastic carcinomas with cartilage
foci. In stark contrast, only 1 of 174 (0.6%) nonmetaplastic invasive carcinomas 
was positive for p63. All Phyllodes tumors and sarcomas were consistently
negative for p63 expression. The sensitivity and specificity of p63 as a
diagnostic marker for metaplastic carcinoma was 86.7% and 99.4%, respectively. We
propose the inclusion of p63 as part of the diagnostic workup of challenging
spindle cell tumors of the breast as a highly specific marker for metaplastic
carcinomas.

Usefulness of basal cell cocktail (34betaE12 + p63) in the diagnosis of atypical 
prostate glandular proliferations.

We evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of the 34betaE12-p63 cocktail, compared
with 34betaE12 and p63 used alone, in 34 prostate needle biopsy (NBXs) and 3
transurethral resection specimens containing atypical glandular proliferations
and in 18 NBXs containing unequivocal prostate carcinoma (PCa). Staining
intensity; percentage of basal cells staining in benign, atypical, and malignant 
glands; number of benign glands lacking basal cell staining; and staining
variance were analyzed. All NBXs with unequivocal PCa were negative with all 3
markers. Diagnoses were as follows for the atypical cases after staining for the 
3 markers: PCa, 9; postatrophic hyperplasia, 12; high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), 5; atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, 6; benign
atypical proliferations, 4; and HGPIN with adjacent small atypical acinar
proliferation suggestive of PCa, 1. The cocktail demonstrated consistently strong
staining intensity and improved basal cell staining in morphologically benign and
benign atypical glands compared with p63 and 34betaE12 alone; it had the smallest
staining variance compared with 34betaE12 (F < 0.0001) and p63 (F = 0.31),
although its advantage for resolving individual atypical cases was limited
compared with 34betaE12 and p63 alone. Of 37 atypical cases, 1 (3%) additionally 
was resolved as benign using the cocktail and p63. Because the diagnosis of PCa
is supported by lack of basal cell staining, the immunohistochemical analysis
with highest possible sensitivity and lowest possible variability is critical to 
ensure that a negative reaction is true. The cocktail provides a simple,
cost-effective improvement in basal cell immunohistochemical analysis of
difficult prostate lesions.

Signet ring cell carcinoma and glassy cell carcinoma are both rare histological
subtypes of uterine cervical cancer. This report is of a case of uterine cervical
carcinoma arising in a 29-year-old woman who had major components of signet ring 
cell carcinoma and glassy cell carcinoma within the same tumor. Histochemical and
immunohistochemical analyses, including high and low molecular weight
cytokeratins, p63 and MUC5AC, additionally demonstrated the squamous and
adenocarcinomatous differentiation in the neoplastic cells, which showed
otherwise unclassifiable morphology on the haematoxylin-eosin sections. A wide
range of differentiation described above supports the speculation that glassy
cell carcinoma may arise from the multipotential immature cells that can
differentiate into both squamous and glandular cells. It would be precise to
classify this tumor as adenosquamous carcinoma. Although adenosquamous carcinoma 
is not a rare histological subtype in the uterine cervix, it should be necessary 
to report the presence of glassy cells and signet ring cells when present because
the presence of both components is associated with an unfavorable clinical
behavior.

S100A2 gene products were shown to be frequently and dramatically
over-represented in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lesions over normal tissue
by microarray analysis. We have now analysed an independent series of NSCLC
tumours and multiple matched normal bronchial epithelial sites by RT-PCR and
immunohistochemistry to investigate: whether this expression pattern can be
confirmed and whether elevated expression is associated with tumour histology,
clinical outcome or preneoplasia. In this second series, S100A2 was strongly
expressed in 76% (35 out of 46) of tumours, more frequently in squamous cell than
adenocarcinomas (P<0.002). This strong expression was not related to high-level
gene amplification, but was associated in one of five informative cases with an
allele-specific imbalance in transcript levels. Most tumours strongly expressed
the DeltaNp63 transcript, the product of which is a putative regulator of S100A2 
transcription and while all but one of the tumours positive for DeltaNp63
expressed S100A2, others negative for this regulator also expressed the gene.
Contrary to the hypothesis that S100A2 is a tumour suppressor, no somatic
mutations were identified in the coding sequence in 44 tumours. Furthermore, an
examination of multiple tumour-free epithelial sites from 20 patients showed that
strong expression was often associated with increasing levels of disorder in
preinvasive bronchial lesions (P<0.0001).

p53 family members with a transactivation (TA) domain induce cell cycle arrest
and promote apoptosis. However, DeltaNp63 isotypes lacking the TA-domain promote 
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vgammavo. Although p53,
TAp63 or TAp73 are stabilized upon DNA damage, we found that the genotoxic stress
agents induced a dramatic decrease and phosphorylation of DeltaNp63alpha in
squamous cell carcinoma cells. Further work revealed that RACK1 physically
associated with the p63alpha C-terminal domain through its WD40 domain. However, 
stratifin binds with phosphorylated DeltaNp63alpha in response to cisplatin. Upon
DNA damage induced by cisplatin, stratifin mediated a nuclear export of
DeltaNp63alpha into cytoplasm and then RACK1 targeted latter into a proteasome
degradation pathway possibly serving as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, siRNA
knockdown of both stratifin and RACK1 inhibited a nuclear export and protein
degradation of DeltaNp63alpha, respectively. Our data suggest that modification
and down regulation of DeltaNp63alpha is one of the major determinants of the
cellular response to DNA damage in human head and neck cancers.

Maspin expression is transactivated by p63 and is critical for the modulation of 
lung cancer progression.

Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

Maspin inhibits metastasis of some cancer cells, and clinical studies have
identified correlations between maspin loss and poor prognosis in several cancer 
types. Maspin was found to be significantly overexpressed in lung cancer samples 
as compared with matched normal lung tissues. However, the regulatory mechanism
of maspin expression remains unclear. We show here that differential expression
of maspin in carcinoma-derived lung cancer cells is regulated at the
transcriptional level. We found that p63 is a critical factor for the
transcription of maspin, which is lost in highly invasive cancer cells such as
NCI-H157, NCI-322, and NCI-358. No correlation was found between maspin
expression and the previously associated transcription factors, p53, Ets1, and
Pdef. Instead, maspin expression was strictly dependent on the presence of p63 in
lung cancer tissues (P < 0.001) and in the tested cell lines. Transient
expression of p63 transactivated the maspin promoter with remarkable fold changes
in cells expressing the TAp63, suggesting that TAp63 might be a novel stimulator 
of the maspin promoter in lung cancer. We have also demonstrated the binding of
p63 protein to a previously identified p53-binding site on the maspin promoter by
gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In tumor tissues, maspin
expression was associated with lymph node involvement (P = 0.035) and tumor stage
(P = 0.063) in all tested cases, except squamous carcinoma. In terms of function,
ectopic expression of maspin inhibited cell invasion in squamous carcinoma as
well as adenocarcinoma. Taken together, these results define maspin as a new
molecular target of p63 that eventually inhibits the invasion of lung cancer.

p63, a recently identified homologue of the p53 gene, has been reported to be
essential in the development of epithelia and is mainly expressed by basal and
myoepithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of 
p63 expression in cutaneous adnexal neoplasms and to assess its possible value in
the differential diagnosis of primary cutaneous neoplasms vs adenocarcinomas
metastatic to the skin. Immunohistochemical analysis for p63 was performed on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 benign adnexal tumors, 
10 malignant adnexal tumors and 14 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. The
expression of p63 was evaluated in epidermal cells, skin appendages and
metastatic tumor cells. p63 was consistently expressed in the basal and
suprabasal cells of epidermis and cutaneous appendages, including the
basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands. Out of 20 benign adnexal tumors, 13
(65%) showed strong (score 3) p63 expression; the remaining seven (35%) cases had
score 2. All primary cutaneous carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas, expressed
p63. In contrast, none of the metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin was positive
for p63 (P<0.001). Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may help in 
the differential diagnosis of primary vs metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinomas.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignancy, the incidence of
which is particularly high in some Asian countries due to the geographically
linked areca quid (AQ) chewing habit. In this study, array-based comparative
genomic hybridization was used to screen microdissected OSCCs for genome-wide
alterations. The highest frequencies of gene gain were detected for TP63,
Serpine1, FGF4/FGF3, c-Myc and DMD. The highest frequencies of deletion were
detected for Caspase8 and MTAP. Gained genes, classified by hierarchical
clustering, were mainly on 17q21-tel; 20q; 11q13; 3q27-29 and the X chromosome.
Among these, gains of EGFR at 7p, FGF4/FGF3, CCND1 and EMS1 at 11q13, and AIB1 at
20q were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. The genomic
profiles of FHIT and EXT1 in AQ-associated and non-AQ-associated OSCCs exhibited 
the most prominent differences. RT-PCR confirmed the significant increase of TP63
and Serpine1 mRNA expression in OSCC relative to non-malignant matched tissue. A 
significant increase in Serpine1 immunoreactivity was observed from non-malignant
matched tissue to OSCC. However, there was no correlation between the frequent
genomic loss of Caspase 8 and a significant decrease in Caspase8 expression.
These data demonstrate that genomic profiling can be useful in analysing
pathogenetic events involved in the genesis or progression of OSCC.

The prostatic utricle is not a Müllerian duct remnant: immunohistochemical
evidence for a distinct urogenital sinus origin.

York, USA. ellen.shapiro@med.nyu.edu

PURPOSE: The embryological origin of the utricle is thought to be a remnant of
the fused caudal ends of the müllerian ducts (MDs). Others propose that the
urogenital sinus (UGS) contributes either partially or totally to the development
of this structure. Using immunohistochemical probes, we provide strong evidence
that the utricle is of UGS origin only.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human fetal prostates, gestational ages 9 to 24 weeks,
were serially cross-sectioned. Representative sections were stained with
antibodies to p63 (basal cell marker), vimentin (mesoderm marker), uroplakins
(marker for urothelium) Pax-2 (expressed in ductal and mesenchyme of urogenital
system including the MDs and wolffian ducts) and Ki67 (proliferation). Apoptosis 
was detected with the TUNEL assay.
RESULTS: By 9 weeks there was weak expression of p63 in the basal layer of the
UGS. At 11 weeks there was increased staining of p63 in the UGS and some p63
staining of the fused MDs, which expressed Pax-2 at this time. At 14 to 15 weeks 
as the MDs were undergoing apoptosis, there was an ingrowth of
uroplakin-expressing UGS epithelium into the periurethral stroma, which formed a 
plate of p63 positive cells just beneath the UGS that was Ki67 positive. The
remaining caudal MD epithelium was p63 negative and expressed vimentin and Pax-2.
By 17 weeks the plate of p63 positive cells elongated forming the utricle that
remained p63 positive but Pax-2 and vimentin negative.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the utricle forms as an ingrowth of specialized cells
from the dorsal wall of the UGS as the caudal MDs regress.

OBJECTIVE: To study p63 expression at mRNA transcript and protein levels in human
lung cancers, including squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma, large
cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), or the
corresponding metastatic foci. The relationship of p63 expression and alterations
in p63 locus at chromosomal 3q27-29 was also determined.
METHODS: p63 gene expression in 72 cases of SCC, adenocarcinoma, LCLC and SCLC
was analyzed by cDNA microarray technology. Tissue microarray of specimens from
150 cases of primary lung cancer was prepared for immunohistochemical study for
p63 protein. Possible chromosomal alterations at the p63 locus in 70 cases of
primary lung cancer were studied by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
technology.
RESULTS: p63 mRNA transcript expression was significantly increased by more than 
10-fold in SCC, as compared with that in other histologic subtypes including
adenocarcinoma, LCLC and SCLC. p63 mRNA expression in metastatic foci was also
remarkably higher than that in their primary tumors (P < 0.001). Immunostaining
showed that p63 protein expression was observed in 94.64% of SCC, whereas only
one lung adenocarcinoma (1.79%) was positive. Immunopositivity was also
demonstrated in 2 of the 4 LCLC cases studied. None of the SCLC cases was
positive. There was a statistically significant difference in p63 expression
between pT1 and pT2 tumors (P < 0.05). The CGH results showed that
overrepresentation of p63 locus at chromosomal 3q27-29 was a typical finding in
SCC. p63 immunopositivity also correlated significantly with pronounced gains of 
p63 locus at chromosomal 3q27-q29 (P < 0.000 1), suggesting that strong
expression of p63 in lung SCC was associated with increased gene amplification.
CONCLUSION: p63 may play a role in oncogenesis of human lung squamous cell
carcinoma and development of metastasis.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Tumor suppressor gene p53 and oncogene C-erbB-2 are
confirmed to have close relation with endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EC), few
documents have been reported about their correlation. Its structural homology to 
p53, p63 has been considered as a tumor suppressor gene acompany with p53
mutation, but its suppressive nature has not been confirmed yet; reports about
p63 expression in EC are rare. This study was designed to investigate the roles
of p53, p63, and C-erbB2 in tumorigenesis and development of EC, and their
correlation with clinicopathological features of EC.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical technique was used to detect P53, P63, and C-erbB2
protein expression in 38 cases of EC, 23 cases of endometrial hyperplasia (EH),
and 10 cases of benign proliferative endometrium (BPE).
RESULTS: (1) The positive rate of P53 in EC was 31.6%,significantly higher than
those in EH and BPE (P < 0.05). P53 expression was associated with surgical
pathologic stage, and depth of myometrial invasion in EC (P< 0.005), but was not 
associated with histological grade (P >0.05). (2) The positive rate of P63 in EC 
was 81.6%, significantly higher than those in EH and BPE (P < 0.005). P63
expression was not associated with histological grade, surgical pathologic stage,
and depth of myometrial invasion in EC (P >0.05). (3) The positive rate of
C-erbB-2 in EC was 23.2%, there was no significant difference compared with those
in EH or BPE (P >0.05).C-erbB-2 expression was associated with surgical
pathologic stage, and depth of myometrial invasion in EC (P< 0.001,P< 0.005),but 
was not associated with histological grade (P >0.05).(4) There was significantly 
positive correlation between P53 and P63 (r =0.443,P < 0.01)or C-erbB-2 (r
=0.490,P < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Both p53 and p63 are involved in carcinogenesis of EC; p63 may act
as an oncogene in tumorigenesis of EC. The expression of P53 and C-erbB2 are
related to the progression of malignant EC; P53 and C-erbB-2 co-expression may
predict poor prognosis.

Survivin regulates cell division and inhibits apoptosis by blocking caspase
activation. The tumor suppressor p53 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces 
apoptosis. Since Survivin overexpression and loss of wild-type p53
expression/function occur in most cancers, we investigated whether Survivin
regulates p53. Stable overexpression of Survivin protects BaF3 cells from
Adriamycin-induced apoptosis, while dominant-negative (T34A) and antisense (AS)
Survivin accelerate apoptosis. In BaF3 cells and transiently transfected MCF7
breast cancer cells, elevation of total and phospho-Ser15-p53 in response to
Adriamycin is blocked by Survivin and enhanced by Survivin disruption.
Furthermore, in Adriamycin-treated MCF7 cells, ectopic Survivin decreased p53
mRNA and increased mRNA and protein of the p53 homologues DeltaNp63 and TAp73 and
mRNA for DeltaNp73, suggesting that Survivin may differentially regulate p53
family transcription. Concomitant with decreasing p53 mRNA, Survivin decreased
Mdm2 mRNA. Survivin disruption by T34A or AS Survivin resulted in reduced Mdm2
protein. The caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, blocked the decrease in Mdm2 as well
as the increase in p53 resulting from Survivin disruption, indicating that
Survivin regulates Mdm2 at the post-translational level. Proteosome inhibition
confirmed that reduced p53 protein observed in cells overexpressing Survivin is
due to enhanced p53 degradation resulting from Survivin-mediated inhibition of
Mdm2 cleavage by caspases. In summary, our results identify regulatory
interactions between Survivin and p53 at the mRNA and protein levels, and suggest
that the p53 homologues DeltaNp63, TAp73 and DeltaNp73 may also be regulated by
Survivin.

p51/p63, a member of the tumor suppressor p53 gene family, is crucial for skin
development. We describe here identification of ITGA3 encoding integrin alpha(3) 
as a target of its trans-activating function, proposing that p51/p63 allows
epidermal stem cells to express laminin receptor alpha(3)beta(1) for anchorage to
the basement membrane. When activated by genotoxic stress or overexpressed
ectopically in non-adherent cells, p51/p63 transduced a phenotype to attach to
extracellular matrices, which was accompanied by expression of ITGA3. Motifs
matching the p53-binding consensus sequence were located in a scattered form in
intron 1 of human ITGA3, and served as p51/p63-responsive elements in reporter
assays. In addition to the trans-activating ability of the TA isoform, we
detected a positive effect of the DeltaN isoform on ITGA3. The high level
alpha(3) production in human keratinocyte stem cells diminished upon elimination 
of p51/p63 by small interfering RNA or by Ca(2+)-induced differentiation.
Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment indicated a physical
interaction of p51/p63 with intron 1 of ITGA3. This study provides a molecular
basis for the standing hypothesis that p51/p63 is essential for
epidermal-mesenchymal interactions.

Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the life versus death of mammalian
neurons is important not only for our understanding of the normal biology of the 
nervous system but also for our efforts to devise approaches to maintain neuronal
survival in the face of traumatic injury or neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we
review the emerging evidence that a key survival/death checkpoint in both
peripheral and central neurons involves the p53 tumor suppressor and its newly
discovered family members, p73 and p63. The full-length isoforms of these
proteins function as proapoptotic proteins, whereas naturally occurring
N-terminal truncated variants of p73 and p63 act as prosurvival proteins, at
least partially by antagonizing the full-length family members. The authors
propose that together, these isoforms comprise an upstream rheostat that sums
different environmental cues to ultimately determine neuronal survival during
development, during neuronal maintenance in adult animals, and even following
traumatic injury.

For genomewide monitoring and identification of biomarkers of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we have conducted a systematic characterization 
of gene expression profiles, using human cDNA microarrays containing 9K clones,
in 25 HNSCC cell lines and 1 immortalized human oral keratinocyte cell line. We
used normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs) as a reference. Our study showed
that genes primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis, cell
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cell adhesion were widely altered
in the 26 cell lines. Upregulated genes included known oncogenes, protein
kinases, DNA-binding proteins and cell cycle regulators, while those commonly
downregulated included differentiation markers, cell adhesion proteins,
extracellular matrix proteins, structural proteins (keratins) and protease
inhibitor proteins. Compared to NHOK, we observed a striking reduction in the
expression of genes involved in terminal differentiation, suggesting that a loss 
in this process is an important signature of HNSCC. In addition, hierarchical
clustering analysis as well as principal component analysis revealed 2
distinctive subtypes of gene expression patterns among the 26 cell lines,
reflecting a degree of heterogeneity in HNSCC. By applying significance analysis 
of microarrays, 128 genes were selected for being distinctively expressed between
the 2 groups. Genes differentially expressed in the 2 subgroups include cell
proliferation-related genes, IGFBP6, EGFR and VEGFC; tumor suppression and
apoptosis-related genes such as Tp53, Tp63; as well as cell cycle regulators such
as CCND1 and CCND2 (cyclins D1 and D2), suggesting that the 2 subgroups might
have undergone different pathways of carcinogenesis.

p53 and its homologues p73 and p63 are transcription factors that play an
essential role in modulating cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to
several environmental stresses. The type and intensity of these responses, which 
can be different depending on the inducing stimulus and on the overall cellular
context, are believed to rely on the activation of defined subsets of target
genes. The proper activation of p53 family members requires the coordinated
action of post-translational modifications and interaction with several
cofactors. In this study, we demonstrate that the multifunctional protein hDaxx
interacts with p53 and its homologues, both in vitro and in vivo, and modulates
their transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that hDaxx, which has been
implicated in several apoptotic pathways, increases the sensitivity to DNA
damage-induced cell death and that this effect requires the presence of p53.
Although hDaxx represses p53-dependent transcription of the p21 gene, it does not
affect the activation of proapoptotic genes, and therefore acts by influencing
the balance between cell cycle arrest and proapoptotic p53 targets. Our results
therefore underline the central role of hDaxx in modulating the apoptotic
threshold upon several stimuli and identify it as a possible integrating factor
that coordinates the response of p53 family members.

Abnormalities of p51, p53, FLT3 and N-ras genes and their prognostic value in
relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

To clarify the role of the genetic mutations in the clinical course of acute
myeloid leukemias (AML), we analyzed for p51, p53, FLT3 and N-ras gene mutations 
and the expression of the p51 gene in relapsed AML. Paired samples obtained from 
patients with AML at both stages of diagnosis and first relapse were analyzed.
Twenty-four patients with relapsed AML survived for 6 to 81 months (median 24
months) from diagnosis. In one patient, no point mutation of the p51 gene was
detected, but loss of the p51 gene expression was observed at both stages. Point 
mutations of the p53 gene were positive at both stages (+/+) in two patients and 
negative at diagnosis and positive at relapse (-/+) in two patients. Tandem
duplication of the FLT3 gene was detected in five patients at both stages (+/+). 
N-ras gene mutations at both stages (+/+) were detected in three patients. Mutant
p53 at relapse was associated with short survival in patients with relapsed AML
(P<0.014). Our findings show that p53 mutations were, at least in part,
associated with the mechanism of relapse in AML, while new p51, FLT3 and N-ras
gene alterations did not occur at relapse. Loss of the p51 gene expression in de 
novo AML has not been reported yet.

PURPOSE: To determine the epithelial lineage of origin in corneal pannus tissue
surgically removed from patients with total limbal stem cell (SC) deficiency.
METHODS: The lineage of origin of the entire conjunctivalized pannus removed from
eight corneas with a diagnosis of total limbal SC deficiency was characterized by
anti-keratin (K)-3 and anti-K19 monoclonal antibodies. The protein and mRNA of
epithelial outgrowth from segments of five such pannus specimens were analyzed by
Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively.
RESULTS: Cross sections of all eight specimens showed a stratified epithelium
with goblet cells expressing mucin (MUC)-5AC, and a stroma showing blood vessels 
and inflammatory cell infiltrates. Immunostaining showed full-thickness
expression of K19 in the entire pannus of all eight specimens. Expression of K3
was negative in seven patients, but was sporadically positive in a patient with
Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In culture, all five pannus specimens generated a
compact, small epithelial cell outgrowth, and except for one, reached confluence 
in 2 to 3 weeks. The K3/K12 pair was expressed by extracts of cell outgrowth from
the control limbal epithelial explant, but not in all five pannus specimens. A
60-kDa band of DeltaNp63 was expressed in the control specimen and in all five
pannus specimens. Cell outgrowth expressed K3 transcript in three, but none
showed K12 transcript.
CONCLUSIONS: The resultant epithelial phenotype of the pannus tissue was not
corneal, as evidenced by the negative staining to cornea-specific K12 mRNA and
protein, but was conjunctival, as evidenced by the presence of goblet cells, the 
weak expression of K3, and the strong expression of K19. The abundant expression 
of DeltaNp63 in such conjunctiva-derived epithelium in eyes with total limbal SC 
deficiency raises doubts as to its validity as a limbal SC marker.

Autosomal dominant EEC syndrome consists of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia,
and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). We investigated an EEC kindred
with 10 affected persons in three generations in order to map the causative
mutation in this family and to map modifier genes that contribute to the
expression of facial clefting in the phenotype. DNA from 15 family members was
genotyped for 388 genome screen markers. Analysis revealed maximal linkage
between EEC and chromosome 3q27, which contains a known EEC gene - tumor protein 
63 (TP63). Sequencing showed a CGT-->TGT missense mutation (R280C) in exon 7,
previously reported to cause EEC in four families, and ectrodactyly alone (split 
hand-foot malformation) in one sporadic case and one large kindred. Analysis of
the clefting phenotype in this EEC family demonstrated maximal linkage to two
regions on chromosomes 4q and 14, which multiple studies have implicated in
non-syndromic CL/P. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the mutation of
TP63 is the major (Mendelian) EEC gene in this kindred and suggests that
additional minor modifying genes which predispose to non-syndromic CL/P could
also contribute to the expression of the clefting component of the syndrome in
this family.

AIM: To investigate the expression of p63 and cytokeratins throughout the course 
of producing a cultivated autograft of limbal epithelial cells.
METHODS: A 75 year old male with a severe alkali burn to his right eye received
two cultivated autografts of limbal epithelial cells on amniotic membrane
followed by a corneal allograft. Immunostaining for p63 and cytokeratins was
performed during ex vivo expansion with 3T3 fibroblasts, following subcultivation
on amniotic membrane, and on the excised corneal button.
RESULTS: Cultures grown in the presence of 3T3 fibroblasts or on amniotic
membrane displayed positive staining for keratins 14 and 19, and p63, but poor
staining for keratin 3 (K3). The excised corneal button possessed a stratified
epithelium of K3 positive cells residing on amniotic membrane.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results document for the first time the co-expression of
cytokeratins 14 and 19 with p63 in a cultivated limbal graft. These data support 
the conclusion that cultivated grafts of limbal epithelium contain predominantly 
undifferentiated cells with the potential to regenerate a normal corneal
epithelium.

Accurate morphologic distinction between small cell carcinoma and poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma has critical therapeutic significance, but
can be limited by crush artifact, tumor necrosis, limited tumor representation,
and overlapping morphologic features. We evaluated a panel of antibodies for
their efficacy in distinguishing between these neoplasms. Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue sections of small cell carcinomas and poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinomas underwent immunohistochemical staining
with antibodies to thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, high molecular weight
keratin, and p16(INK4A). Of 28 small cell carcinomas, 26 (93%) small cell
carcinomas showed diffuse moderate or strong staining for thyroid transcription
factor-1 with no staining for high molecular weight keratin and p63. In contrast,
27/28 (96%) poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas manifested opposite
immunoreactivities, with diffuse moderate or strong staining for high molecular
weight keratin and p63, and no or minimal staining for thyroid transcription
factor-1. In two additional cases originally interpreted as small cell carcinoma,
high molecular weight keratin highlighted small numbers of neoplastic large
cells, leading to reclassification as combined small cell and non-small cell
carcinomas. p16(INK4A) expression varied widely in poorly differentiated squamous
cell carcinomas, but was consistently moderate or strong and diffuse in small
cell carcinomas, and proved helpful in the two thyroid transcription
factor-1-negative small cell carcinomas. This study demonstrates that a panel
consisting of antibodies to thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, high molecular
weight keratin, and p16(INK4A) is highly effective for distinguishing between
small cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This
panel also facilitates diagnosis of combined small cell and non-small cell
carcinomas.

CP-31398 restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro but does not affect
p53 homologs p63 and p73.

The p53 protein plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability in
mammalian cells. Mutations of p53 occur in over 50% of all cancers and are
indicative of highly aggressive cancers that are hard to treat. Recently, there
has been a high degree of interest in therapeutic approaches to restore growth
suppression functions to mutant p53. Several compounds have been reported to
restore wild type function to mutant p53. One such compound, CP-31398, has been
shown effective in vivo, but questions have arisen to whether it actually affects
p53. Here we show that mutant p53, isolated from cells treated with CP-31398, is 
capable of binding to p53 response elements in vitro. We also show the compound
restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in cells as determined by a chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain from two
different hotspot mutants (R273H and R249S), we show that CP-31398 can restore
DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using a quantitative DNA binding
assay, we also show that CP-31398 increases significantly the amount of mutant
p53 that binds to cognate DNA (B(max)) and its affinity (K(d)) for DNA. The
compound, however, does not affect the affinity (K(d) value) of wild type p53 for
DNA and only increases B(max) slightly. In a similar assay PRIMA1 does not have
any effect on p53 core DNA-binding activity. We also show that CP-31398 had no
effect on the DNA-binding activity of p53 homologs p63 and p73.

Mutation hotspots in the p53 gene in tumors of different origin: correlation with
evolutionary conservation and signs of positive selection.

We present a classification analysis of the mutation spectra of the p53 gene and 
construct maps of hotspots for the germline (Li-Fraumein syndrome), different
types of tumors and their derived cell lines. While spectra from solid tumors
share common hotspots with the germline spectrum, they also contain unique sets
of somatic hotspots that are not observed in the germline. All these hotspots
correspond to amino acid replacements in the DNA-binding interface of p53. The
mutation spectra of lymphomas and cell lines derived from lymphomas and lung
cancers contained few hotspots compared to solid tumors. Thus, the distribution
of hotspots in the p53 gene appears to depend on the tumor type and cell growth
conditions; this specificity is missed by the bulk hotspot analysis. A negative
correlation was detected between the amino acid replacement propensity in tumors 
and evolutionary variability: the hotspots are located in the positions that are 
highly conserved in p53 and its paralogs, p63 and p73. In all the mutation
spectra, substitutions leading to amino acid replacements strongly dominate over 
silent substitutions, indicating that functional sites evolving under strong
purifying selection are subject to intensive positive selection in p53-dependent 
tumors. These results are compatible with the gain-of-function concept of the
role of p53 in tumorigenesis.

The tumor suppressor p53 is critically important in the cellular damage response 
and is the founding member of a family of proteins. All three genes regulate cell
cycle and apoptosis after DNA damage. However, despite a remarkable structural
and partly functional similarity among p53, p63, and p73, mouse knockout studies 
revealed an unexpected functional diversity among them. p63 and p73 knockouts
exhibit severe developmental abnormalities but no increased cancer
susceptibility, whereas this picture is reversed for p53 knockouts. Neither p63
nor p73 is the target of inactivating mutations in human cancers. Genomic
organization is more complex in p63 and p73, largely the result of an alternative
internal promoter generating NH2-terminally deleted dominant-negative proteins
that engage in inhibitory circuits within the family. Deregulated
dominant-negative p73 isoforms might play an active oncogenic role in some human 
cancers. Moreover, COOH-terminal extensions specific for p63 and p73 enable
further unique protein-protein interactions with regulatory pathways involved in 
development, differentiation, proliferation, and damage response. Thus, p53
family proteins take on functions within a wide biological spectrum stretching
from development (p63 and p73), DNA damage response via apoptosis and cell cycle 
arrest (p53, TAp63, and TAp73), chemosensitivity of tumors (p53 and TAp73), and
immortalization and oncogenesis (DeltaNp73).

BACKGROUND: p63 is a p53 homolog and a marker expressed in replicating
keratinocytes. Survivin is a recently characterized inhibitor of apoptosis
protein that is abundantly expressed in most solid and hematologic malignancies. 
Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the major determinant of human
telomerase activity, and its expression is indicative of unlimited replication.
We herein evaluated the expression profiles of p63, p53, survivin, and hTERT in
usual skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell
carcinoma (BCC) and putative preneoplastic epidermal lesions, including actinic
keratosis (AK), Bowen's disease, and porokeratosis.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against p63, p53, survivin, and
hTERT was performed. Semi-quantitative evaluation (-, +, 2+, 3+) was carried out.
RESULTS: BCCs showed diffuse p63 expression and SCCs heterogeneous p63 expression
with negativity in terminally differentiated squamous cells. All preneoplastic
epidermal lesions showed p63 expression in all cell layers. p53 was found in
seven of 10 cases of BCCs, all 10 cases of SCCs, and nine of 10 cases of Bowen's 
disease. AK and porokeratosis revealed focal to moderate p53 expression. Survivin
was found in eight of 10 cases of SCCs and eight of 10 cases of Bowen's disease. 
Six of 10 cases of BCCs revealed weak survivin positivity. AK and porokeratosis
showed survivin expression confined to the basal layer. hTERT expression was
found in most cases of skin cancers and preneoplastic lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 expression may be a marker of basal/progenitor cells and a
diagnostic marker in skin tumors. p63 expression is not related to p53 expression
in these tumors. This study points to a putative role of survivin and hTERT in
the development of certain skin cancers. In addition, our data support the
concept of porokeratosis being a premalignant condition.

BACKGROUND: It is known that cellular senescence could affect culture results. A 
previous study on K19 found that the loss of stem cell proportion is the reason
for difficulties experienced when culturing aged keratinocytes. But the situation
is unclear, because K19 is not generally accepted as an epidermal stem cell
marker.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cellular
senescence caused by chronological aging or by repeated subcultures.
METHODS: The effects of cellular senescence were investigated using monolayer
cultures of keratinocytes and reconstructed epidermis. We prepared keratinocytes 
from donors of different ages and by repeated subcultures. Flow cytometric
analysis was performed using alpha6 integrin and CD71 antibodies, and candidate
keratinocyte stem cell proportions were separated according to reactivities to
these antibodies. Living skin equivalents (LSEs) were reconstructed using
keratinocytes from child, adult and elderly donors.
RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis showed a decrease in the candidate stem cell
proportion in an age- or culture passage-dependent manner. LSE experiments showed
that a reconstructed epidermis using child's keratinocytes was well formed
compared to epidermis reconstructed using an elderly donor's keratinocytes.
Different expression of proliferation markers was also observed according to
donor age.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that cellular senescence by chronological aging or
repeated sub-culture induced the loss of candidate stem cell proportion in
keratinocyte cultures. This seems to be the reason why it is difficult to culture
keratinocytes from the elderly or by repeatedly culturing keratinocytes in vitro.

p63, a recently identified member of the p53 gene family, plays an important role
in human tissue functions. We examined the pattern of p63 expression in human
esophageal squamous cell carcinomas including early-stage cancers, and its
clinicopathological significance. Immunoreactivity for p63 was detected in 96.9% 
(63/65) esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Diffuse p63 expression was seen in
75.4% (49/65). p63 was detected not only in the in situ carcinomatous components 
or intramucosal carcinomas, but also in the invasive carcinomatous parts of the
p63-positive cases. There were no significant correlations between p63 expression
and clinicopathological features, such as depth of tumor invasion, tumor
differentiation, lymph node metastasis and venous/lymphatic invasion. We also
analyzed the relationship between p63 and p53 expression in esophageal squamous
cell carcinomas. These results suggest that the p63 gene, as well as the p53
gene, play a major role in the carcinogenesis of human esophageal squamous cells 
and in the growth of the carcinoma.

p73 and p63: why do we still need them?

When p73 and p63 were initially described as homologues of the tumor suppressor
p53, the three family members seemed almost exchangeable, raising the question
why all three were retained during evolution. It later turned out that the
corresponding genes, TP63 and TP73, appear phylogenetically older than TP53, and 
that their targeted deletion causes severe developmental defects, in contrast to 
a deletion of TP53. Hence, p63 and p73 are responsible for biological effects
that cannot be elicited by p53 alone. Here, we provide an overview of properties 
ascribed to p63 and p73 that distinguish them from p53. Differences occur at the 
following levels: (i) protein structure, especially with regard to the
aminoterminal transactivation domains and the carboxyterminal portions unique to 
p63 and p73; (ii) regulation, affecting mRNA levels, posttranslational
modifications and interaction with other cellular proteins; (iii) activities,
resulting in the regulation of gene expression, the programming of development,
and the emergence of tumors. We speculate that, during the course of evolution,
p63 and p73 have first pursued a broader range of activities, whereas p53 later
specialized on genome maintenance.

Keloids are benign skin tumors that develop following wounding. A cDNA product
from human keloid specimens was identified using the differential display
technique. The full-length cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using human keloid mRNA as
template. The predicted product of the cDNA was found to be 99% identical to the 
DeltaN-p63 gamma isotype of p63, a transcription factor that belongs to the
family that includes the structurally related tumor suppressor p53 and p73. The
DeltaN-p63 isotype lacks the acidic N terminal region corresponding to the
transactivation domain of p53. Since this can potentially block p53-mediated
target gene transactivation, it may serve as a dominant-negative isoform.
Real-Time RT-PCR analysis of RNAs from normal skin tissue and keloids showed that
the DeltaN-p63 isotype is specifically expressed in keloids, but is virtually
undetectable in normal skin. Immunostaining of p63 in normal skin revealed that
only basal cells of the epithelium expressed the protein, while in keloid tissues
the antigen was detected in the nuclei of cells scattered through all layers of
the epithelium and in fibroblast-like cells in the dermis. These results may
indicate that aberrant p63 expression plays a role not only in malignant tumors
but also in benign skin diseases that show hyperproliferation of epidermal cells 
in vivo. Moreover, this isoform of p63 could serve as a specific molecular marker
for this human disease.

BACKGROUND: The recent discovery of two p53-related genes, p63 and p73, has
revealed an additional level of complexity to the study of p53 function. Both
genes encode multiple proteins arising from alternative promoter usage and
splicing, with transactivation, DNA-binding, and tetramerization domains. Recent 
data support a role for p63 in squamous and transitional cell carcinomas, as well
as in certain lymphomas and thymomas.
METHODS: To characterize the involvement of p63 and p73 in the development of
osteosarcoma, we analyzed the expression and mutation of TAp63 and TAp73 in six
osteosarcoma cell lines and twelve osteosarcoma specimens.
RESULTS: Semiquantitative DNA/PCR analysis revealed that eight (67%) and six
(50%) out of twelve osteosarcoma specimens showed significantly reduced levels of
p63 and p73 transcription, respectively. Direct sequencing of the entire coding
region detected no mutations in cell lines or osteosarcoma specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that low expression of p63 and p73 is relatively
common in osteosarcomas and might contribute to their molecular pathogenesis.

This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of TP53 
alterations stratified for the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism (c.215G>C, p.Arg72Pro) 
in a cohort of 109 patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas. TP53 sequence
variants were observed in 80 of the 109 (73.4%) tumors and were significantly
associated with grade of differentiation (P=0.001). A tendency towards higher
frequency of sequence variants in tumors with higher FIGO stages was seen
(P=0.05). The type of TP53 sequence variant (transition A:T>G:C vs. G:C>A:T at
CpG dinucleotides, and transversion G:C>T:A) had significant correlation with
patients' age (P=0.04) with more A:T>G:C in patients over 60 years old. No
significant associations were found between frequency of sequence variants and
age at diagnosis, histological type, size of residual tumor after primary
surgery, or long-term survival. Analyses of the codon 72 polymorphism in tumor
DNA gave a higher frequency of homozygosity/hemizygosity than expected from the
population frequency, particularly for the Pro allele. Tumors homozygous or
hemizygous for the Pro allele had significantly higher frequency of TP53 sequence
variants, particularly of the nonmissense type (P=0.002), and patients with these
types of alterations had significantly shorter survival (P=0.04). TP53 protein
accumulation, determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), was found in 67.9% (74
out of 109) of the tumors, was significantly more common among serous than
nonserous ovarian carcinomas (P=0.008), and had a significant effect on
progression-free survival (P=0.03). p63 (TP73L; formerly TP63) and p73 (TP73)
protein accumulation detected by IHC was seen in 67.9 and 0% of the tumors,
respectively. A significantly higher frequency of p63-positive cases was seen
among serous tumors (P=0.008) and tended to increase with increasing FIGO stages 
(P=0.05), but had no significant effect on survival. No association between p63
protein accumulation and TP53 protein accumulation was seen.

Prostatic needle biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosing early prostate
cancer, providing specific information. In cases of histological cancer mimics, a
diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation suspected of but not diagnosed
as malignancy can be made. In such cases, and in small focus carcinomas,
pathologists use 34betaE12, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 or p63 immunostaining to label
basal cells, and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR/p504s) immunostaining as a 
positive prostate cancer marker on two distinct slides. However, in cases of
small foci, ambiguous lesions might disappear. The purpose of our study was to
improve the sensitivity of a cocktail of two antibodies (p63/p504s) with a sample
incubation on 260 prostatic specimens, in order to help make a decision in
conjunction with standard histology and CK 5/6 immunostaining. We tested 101
small focus prostatic cancers, 104 atypical small acinar proliferation, 19
high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, two atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia and 34 benign mimics of cancer. After p63/p504s immunostaining, the
final diagnoses retained were as follows: 154 prostatic cancers, 14 atypical
small acinar proliferation, 30 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia,
three atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and 62 benign mimics of cancer. To
differentiate malignant from benign lesions, we used the criteria of greater
sensitivity to p504s/p63 (95%) than to CK 5/6 (57%) or p63 (86%), and higher
specificity for p504s/p63 (95%) than for CK 5/6 (88%) or p63 (81%). With the
p504s/p63 cocktail, 89% of the ambiguous lesions were classified vs 53% for CK
5/6. Combined use of the two antibodies, one (p504s) as a positive marker and the
other (p63) as a negative marker, with a simple immunostaining procedure, may
improve diagnostic performance, sensitivity and specificity, leading to a
reduction in the risk of false negatives; this technique in cases of atypical
small acinar proliferation should reduce the percentage of residual ambiguous
lesions and the need for additional biopsies.

Discrimination of well-differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma from reactive
bronchioloalveolar epithelium can be difficult on routine histology, especially
with small biopsies. Ancillary studies to help in this distinction are desirable.
p63, a p53-homologous nuclear protein, is a marker of reserve cells of the
bronchus and terminal lobular unit. In this study, 33 cases of adenocarcinoma (20
open lung and 13 transbronchial/percutaneous biopsies) and 43 cases of benign
lungs with fibrosis and metaplasia (22 open lung and 21
transbronchial/percutaneous biopsies) were studied for nuclear p63 expression by 
immunohistochemistry (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Five additional cases each of 
atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenosquamous carcinoma and three cases of
squamous carcinoma (all open lung biopsies) were also stained. The diagnostic
categories of benign lung conditions were usual interstitial pneumonia,
parenchymal scar, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage.
In neoplastic cases, p63 positivity was calculated as percentage of all tumor
cells examined. In areas of normal lung, p63 decorated the reserve cells of large
and small airways and occasional cells of the distal lobular unit. In fibrotic
reactive processes, an interrupted but distinct pattern of nuclear staining was
present in all cases, with staining of basal cells of the airways as well as
bronchiolar- and squamous-metaplastic epithelium (43/43, 100%). p63
immunoreactivity was less uniform in areas of acute lung injury within these
cases. One adenocarcinoma and two cases of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia
showed strong immunoreactivity (>80%), while three adenocarcinomas highlighted
only rare tumor nuclei (<5% of tumor cells). Morphologic areas where p63
immunostaining was not helpful included the junction of normal lung and lepidic
growth of adenocarcinoma, and retrograde spread of adenocarcinoma into small
airways. Our results highlight the differential expression of p63 across various 
bronchioloalveolar lesions. Moreover, p63 may be helpful in distinguishing
reactive from neoplastic glandular proliferations in the lung.

Numerous lesions of the prostate, such as atrophy, adenomatous atypical
hyperplasia (adenosis) or PIN can be misdiagnosed with prostatic cancer, and
confused with ASAP, leading to perform additional biopsies. In such lesions, the 
pathologist can perform an immunohistochemical study with the anti-high molecular
weight cytokeratin antibody CK903 (34bE12), which confirms the absence of basal
cells and supports the diagnosis of prostatic cancer.AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare
markers of basal cells (cytokeratin 5/6, p63) and the marker of prostatic
carcinomatous glands (p504s) or alpha methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 44 cases of paraffin-embedded
prostatic specimens (36 biopsies, 4 PER, 1 adenomectomy and 3 radical
prostatectomies), consisting in 20 cases of prostatic carcinomas (2 intraductal, 
12 Gleason 6 (3+3), 4 Gleason 7 (4+3), 2 Gleason 8 (4+4)), 11 ASAP, 9 PIN (2 low 
grade, 7 high grade (2 isolated)), and 10 benign lesions (8 atrophy, 1 atypical
adenomatous hyperplasia and 1 case of clear cell cribriform hyperplasia). All
cases were tested with antibodies to CK 5/6, and with a cocktail to p63 and
p504s, after heat antigenic retrieval on NEXES Ventana processor.
RESULTS: Basal cells of normal prostatic glands stained with CK5/6 and p63 in
91,3% and 100% of cases, independently from the fixation procedure (Bouin or
Formalin). Carcinomas had a p63-/p504s+ profile, PIN were p63+/p504s+, and benign
lesions were p63+/p504s-. We observed an increase in sensitivity: p63/p504s
(100%), CK5/6 (80%), p63 (90%), p504s (95%), and specificity: p53/p504s (90%),
CK5/6 (87.5%), p63 (90.5%), p504s (90.9%).
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the use of a cocktail to p63/p504s is more
specific than the use of CK5/6 alone this technique supports a diagnosis of
prostatic cancer in 40% of cases previously considered as ASAP.

Critical role of p63 in the development of a normal esophageal and

The trachea and esophagus originate from the foregut endoderm during early
embryonic development. Their epithelia undergo a series of changes involving the 
differentiation of stem cells into unique cell types and ultimately forming the
mature epithelia. In this study, we monitored the expression of p63 in the
esophagus and the trachea during development and examined in detail morphogenesis
in p63(-/-) mice. At embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), the esophageal and
tracheobronchial epithelia contain two to three layers of cells; however, only
the progenitor cells express p63. These progenitor cells differentiate first into
ciliated cells (p63(-)/beta-tubulin IV(+)) and after birth into mature basal
cells (p63(+)/K14(+)/K5(+)/BS-I-B4(+)). In the adult pseudostratified, columnar
tracheal epithelium, K14(+)/K5(+)/BS-I-B4(+) basal cells stain most intensely for
p63, whereas ciliated and mucosecretory cells are negative. In stratified
squamous esophageal epithelium and during squamous metaplasia in the trachea,
cells in the basal layer stain strongest for p63, whereas p63 staining declines
progressively in transient amplifying and squamous differentiated cells.
Generally, p63 expression is restricted to human squamous cell carcinomas, and
adenocarcinomas and Barrett's metaplasia do not stain for p63. Examination of
morphogenesis in newborn p63(-/-) mice showed an abnormal persistence of ciliated
cells in the esophagus. Significantly, in both tissues, lack of p63 expression
results in the development of a highly ordered, columnar ciliated epithelium
deficient in basal cells. These observations indicate that p63 plays a critical
role in the development of normal esophageal and tracheobronchial epithelia and
appears to control the commitment of early stem cells into basal cell progeny and
the maintenance of basal cells.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze p63 and p53 immunoreactivity of upper urinary tract
transitional cell carcinoma with respect to prognosis. p63 is required for the
differentiation of normal urothelium and is expressed in both non-neoplastic
urothelium and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
METHODS: A total of 53 upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma specimens 
were investigated immunohistochemically using a tissue microarray technique. p63 
and p53 immunoreactivity was analyzed digitally with respect to associations with
pT stage and grade and impact on disease-free survival.
RESULTS: p63 expression was detected in 51 (96.2%) of 53 cases. Normal expression
(greater than 90% of tumor cell nuclei) was observed in 1 (4.5%) of 22 Stage pT3 
compared with 13 (41.9%) of 31 Stage pT1-T2 tumors (P = 0.003) and 4 (16%) of 25 
G3 compared with 10 (35.7%) of 28 G2 tumors (P = 0.13). p53 overexpression (more 
than 10% of tumor cell nuclei) was found in 10 (18.9%) of 53 cases, including 2
(6.5%) of 31 Stage pT1-T2 and 8 (36.4%) of 22 Stage pT3 (P = 0.011) and 0 of 28
G2 and 10 (40%) of 25 G3 tumors (P <0.001). Metastatic disease was observed in 14
(26.4%) of 53 patients, including none of 14 with normal p63 expression compared 
with 14 (35.9%) of 39 with decreased (less than 90% of tumor cell nuclei) p63
expression (P = 0.02) and 5 (50%) of 10 patients with p53 overexpression compared
with 9 (20.9%) of 43 patients with p53-negative tumors (P = 0.01). Multivariate
analysis proved Stage pT3 was the only independent prognostic factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased p63 immunoreactivity and p53 overexpression were
significantly associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. However, 
neither parameter was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.

Abnormalities in the p53 gene have been regarded as the most consistent genetic
abnormalities detected in head and neck squamous cell carcinogenesis. Two new
members of the p53 gene family, p73 and p63, have recently been identified. We
investigated the expression of the two N-terminal p63 isoforms (TA and deltaN
isoforms) in human primary well-differentiated buccal squamous cell carcinoma.
Both TAp63 and deltaNp63 isoforms were detected in the basal/suprabasal layers of
all of the five specimens of normal buccal mucosa. The deltaNp63 isoform was
found in all of the 23 specimens of human primary well-differentiated buccal
carcinoma whereas TAp63 isoform was absent in 18 (78.3%) of the 23 specimens. The
immunostaining patterns of both TAp63 and deltaNp63 isoforms were similar in that
the p63 positivity was noted mainly in the peripheral cells of tumor nests
whereas negative staining was observed in the areas with keratin pearl formation.
A higher number of T3-T4 patients and patients with recurrence showed negative
staining of TAp63 than T1-T2 patients and patients without recurrence but the
difference was not statistically significant. These results suggested that
specific p63 isoforms were associated with human oral squamous cell
carcinogenesis. The deltaNp63 isoforms might be involved in epithelial
differentiation and proliferation in human oral carcinogenesis whereas there was 
evidence for a possible role of TAp63 under-expression in human oral
tumorigenesis.

Cultivated human corneal epithelial cells have been successfully used for corneal
reconstruction. Explant and single cell systems are currently used for human
corneal epithelial cultivation. This study was conducted to characterize the
phenotypes of human corneal epithelial cells expanded ex vivo by these two
culture systems with regard to their growth potential, morphology and antigen
expression patterns. Human corneal epithelial cells were expanded by limbal
explant culture or limbal single cell suspension culture on a mitomycin C treated
3T3 fibroblast feeder layer. The phenotypes of primary cultured cells were
evaluated by morphology and immunohistochemical staining with antibodies for
proposed keratinocyte stem cell markers (p63, EGFR, K19 and integrin beta1) and
differentiation markers (K3, involucrin and gap junction protein connexin 43).
BrdU labeling was performed to identify the label-retaining cells. Human corneal 
epithelial cells were grown from limbal tissues preserved as long as 16 days by
both culture systems. The growth rate depended on the tissue freshness, the time 
from death to preservation and the time from death to culture, but not on the
donor age. Cell growth was observed in 96.2% (n = 43) of single cell suspension
cultures and in 90.8% (n = 213) of explant cultures. The cell expansion was
confluent in 10-14 days in single cell suspension cultures and 14-21 days in
explant cultures. The cell morphology in single cell suspension culture was
smaller, more compact and uniform than that in explant culture. Immunostaining
showed a greater number of the small cells expressing p63, EGFR, K19 and integrin
beta1, while more larger cells stained positively for K3, involucrin and connexin
43 in both culture systems. BrdU-label retaining cells were identified in
2.3+/-0.7% of explant cultures and 3.73+/-1.5% of single cell cultures chased for
21 days. In conclusion, the limbal rims are a great treasure for ex vivo
expansion of human corneal epithelial cells. The phenotypes of corneal epithelial
cells, ranging from basal cells to superficial differentiated cells, are well
maintained in both culture systems. Slow-cycling BrdU-label retaining cells, that
are characteristic of stem cells, were identified in the cultures.

We report on a three-dimensional organotypic culture in vitro of explants from
the human uterine exocervix. Exocervical fragments (2-3 mm3) from pre-menopausal 
women were cultured on sponges submerged in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium
containing p-nonylphenol and 10% fetal bovine serum for up to 3 weeks and the
viability and cellular responses were assayed. The fragments were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry for the expression and distribution of a broad spectrum of
cellular markers: p63, Ki-67, involucrin, high molecular weight cytokeratins,
estrogen receptor-alpha, vimentin, CD45, and CD31. The fragments preserved their 
tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity comparable to that observed in
exocervical tissue in vivo. Prior to culture, the original epithelium was
composed of stratified multilayered keratinocytes with integrated
monocyte/dendritic-like cells in the basal and suprabasal layers. The epithelium 
began to exfoliate in culture and within 4 days appeared to have lost its
differentiated high-zone layers of keratinocytes. After 10 days a new epithelium,
slightly different from the original one, was formed; it displayed an increasing 
prominence of basal and suprabasal keratinocyte layers, containing infiltrating
leukocytes that had probably migrated from the submucosa. The epithelium
subsequently lost its organization, concomitant with a progressive involution of 
the stroma. Subepithelial capillaries appeared to be well maintained throughout
the culture period. Aside from the maintenance of cellular heterogeneity within
the fragments of exocervix, these culture systems are a valuable tool for
studying the mechanisms of epithelial regeneration, and may prove to be a useful 
model for studying mucosal immunity.

Serial cultivation of chicken keratinocytes, a composite cell type that
accumulates lipids and synthesizes a novel beta-keratin.

The epidermis of birds differs from that of mammals by the presence of
intracellular lipid droplets and the absence of sebaceous glands. We describe
here the cultivation of chicken epidermal keratinocytes; these cells cannot be
grown in medium supplemented with the usual fetal bovine serum even in the
presence of supporting 3T3 cells, but they can grow from single cells in the
presence of supporting 3T3 cells and 10% chicken serum. As revealed by their cell
structure, their protein composition, and their gene expression, chicken
keratinocytes possess the general properties of mammalian keratinocytes. They
ultimately undergo in culture a process of terminal differentiation in which
their nucleus is destroyed and a cornified envelope is formed. Chicken
keratinocytes also show important properties that mammalian keratinocytes do not 
possess: they accumulate neutral lipids, usually in the form of a single
perinuclear droplet; they accumulate carotenoids; they synthesize beta-keratins; 
and their multiplication requires a non-lipid factor, present in chicken serum
but not in fetal calf serum. The lipid-synthesizing function of sebocytes in
mammals is carried out by the keratinocytes themselves in birds. The availability
of cultured chicken keratinocytes should allow studies that were hitherto
impossible such as the tracing of the keratinocyte lineage during development of 
the chicken embryo and the investigation of the complete life cycle of viruses
that require specific chicken keratinocyte products (such as Marek's disease
virus).

Assessment of p63 expression in the salivary gland neoplasms adenoid cystic
carcinoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, and basal cell and canalicular 
adenomas.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of p63
immunoreactivity in the malignant salivary gland neoplasms adenoid cystic
carcinoma (ACC) and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) and to compare
this to the expression of this marker in the benign salivary gland tumors
canalicular adenoma and basal cell adenoma. Few studies on the expression of p63 
in head and neck salivary gland tumors have been published to date. P63, a
selective immunohistochemical marker of basal/stem cells of stratified epithelium
and of myoepithelial cells, is a p53 homologue that plays an essential role in
both morphogenesis of epidermis and limb development. P63 immunoreactivity has
been demonstrated in squamous cell and urothelial carcinomas. It is generally
absent in most nonsquamous cell carcinomas. Study design Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded sections from 49 salivary gland neoplasms, representing 6
canalicular adenomas, 11 basal cell adenomas, 17 PLGA and 15 ACC accessioned from
1989 to 2002 by the Department of Pathology, Long Island Jewish Medical Center,
New Hyde Park, NY, were stained with an anti-p63 monoclonal antibody.
RESULTS: Nuclear p63 reactivity was uniformly positive in PLGA (17/17, 100%).
Positive reactivity was also identified in the majority of cases of ACC (13/15,
87%), primarily in the nonluminal myoepithelial-like cells surrounding luminal
cells. Canalicular adenoma did not exhibit any p63 immunoreactivity. All basal
cell adenomas of parotid origin stained strongly for p63, with staining localized
to the peripheral tumor cells situated adjacent to the connective tissue stroma. 
None of the basal cell adenomas originating in the upper lip stained with p63. In
native adjacent salivary gland tissue, p63 reactivity was identified focally in
the nuclei of myoepithelial and basal duct cells.
CONCLUSIONS: P63 is strongly expressed in basal cell adenoma of parotid origin,
and in ACC and PLGA. Canalicular adenoma did not demonstrate p63 staining,
consistent with this tumor's putative luminal ductal cell differentiation. Our
results suggest that the neoplastic cells in PLGA may represent either a
population of p63-positive epithelial stem/reserve cells similar to the basal
cells of stratified epithelium, or modified myoepithelial cells. Given the
staining pattern of the tumors examined, p63 does not appear to be an ideal
marker for distinguishing between ACC, PLGA, and basal cell adenoma.

In this study, we investigated the localization and functional significance of
p53 tumor suppressor-like molecules, p63 and p73, in human thymic epithelial
cells (TECs). Immunohistochemical studies showed particular distribution profiles
of p63 and p73 in thymic epithelium, in which cortical TECs preferentially
expressed p63 in their nuclei whereas subcapsular and medullary TECs expressed
both p63 and p73 in their nuclei. The wide distribution of p63 in TECs was
further suggested by studies using TECs of primary culture. In vitro studies
using two human TEC lines demonstrated that p63 was capable of up-regulating
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and enhancing the production of IL-6
and IL-8. Moreover, in vitro studies also indicated that p73, but not p63, had
the capacity to induce granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the TEC lines. These
findings suggest that p63 would regulate the cell adhesive property through
ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction and the production of IL-6 and IL-8, probably in all TEC
subtypes. p73 in subcapslar and medullary TECs was suggested to play a role in
the regulation of the production of GM-CSF and G-CSF, which might stimulate other
stromal cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages and endothelial cells around
these regions.

The ectodermal dysplasias (ED) are a large and complex group of diseases
characterized by anomalies of the ectoderm and its derivates, often associated
with malformations in other organs. We report a patient with an ectodermal
dysplasia affecting hair, teeth, and nails and malformations of all four
extremities including absence of several rays in the hands and feet. This patient
shares many similarities with odontotrichomelic syndrome, a rare ectodermal
dysplasia syndrome that has so far only been described in three individuals.
However, some differences exist and this patient might also represent a separate 
ectodermal dysplasia syndrome. p63, a gene that is mutated in a number of
syndromes associated with ectodermal dysplasia and limb malformations, was
considered a possible candidate gene. However, no mutation in p63 was identified.

The tissue organization of the salivary gland is complex, and a large number of
salivary gland tumor entities with a broad morphologic spectrum are listed,
creating tumor classification schema for the salivary glands that are difficult
to understand. In the present study, we attempted to examine how the anatomical
components of the salivary gland are associated with morphological subtypes of
tumors. We selected a panel of 12 molecules, which labeled one or some of the
components, with all of the markers covering every component of the salivary
glands. Using tissue microarray, expression profiles of these molecules were
examined in four representative spots from each of 88 salivary gland tumors. The 
resulting large data matrix was analyzed using principle component analysis
(PCA). We considered the first three eigenvectors to be significant; as the
eigenvalues were more than 1.0 and the cumulative proportion achieved was 67%.
Comparison with expression patterns in normal tissue suggested that the three
components represented myoepithelial differentiation, and luminal and basal cell 
phenotypes. Then, we compared the PCA results with individual morphologic
subtypes. Individual subtypes were clustered among the three dimensions of the
components. This implies that salivary gland tumors may be well characterized by 
using only three components.

Solid cell nests of the human thyroid gland are composed of main cells and C
cells. In order to investigate the putative stem cell nature of the role for
solid cell nests, we evaluated the histological features, and the
immunohistochemical expression of p63, bcl-2, telomerase catalytic subunit, and
two proliferative markers (Ki-67 and minichromosome maintenance protein 2), in a 
series of 24 cases of solid cell nests. Proliferative indices were determined in 
(a) solid cell nests, (b) thyroid follicular cells in the vicinity of solid cell 
nests within a low-power field, and (c) distant thyroid tissue, at a distance of 
at least three low-power fields from solid cell nests. In 15 cases of solid cell 
nests (62.5%), mixed follicles were observed; papillary formations were observed 
in four cases (16.6%), and ciliated cells were observed in the lining of
microcysts associated with two cases (8.3%). Salivary gland-type tissue,
cartilage islands, adipose and fibrous tissues, and small nerves were also
associated with some cases of solid cell nests. We observed that the main cells
of the solid cell nests express consistently telomerase, although at lower levels
than p63, and show strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for bcl-2, which is
associated with an increased differentiation potential. We also observed that
despite their relative low proliferative index, main cells of the solid cell
nests display higher proliferation than follicular cells in the vicinity and
follicular cells in more distant thyroid tissue. We conclude that main cells of
the solid cell nests apparently harbor the minimal properties of a stem cell
phenotype (capacity for both self-renewal, conferred by telomerase activity, and 
differentiation to one or more than one type of specialized cells, given by the
high expression of p63 and bcl-2) and may thus represent a pool of stem cells of 
the adult thyroid.

Discovery of the p53 homologs p63 and p73 has brought new excitement to the p53
field. Identification of homologous genes coding for several proteins with
similar and antagonistic properties towards p53 has been both intriguing and
perplexing. A multitude of properties have been attributed to these new homologs 
and this review will focus on the biochemical and biological aspects of one
family member, p63. Although the most ancient member of the p53 family, p63 is
the most recently discovered and the least is known about this family member.
Unlike p53, whose protein expression is not readily detectable in epithelial
cells unless they are exposed to various stress conditions, p63 is expressed in
select epithelial cells at high levels under normal conditions. p63 is highly
expressed in embryonic ectoderm and in the nuclei of basal regenerative cells of 
many epithelial tissues in the adult including skin, breast myoepithelium, oral
epithelium, prostate and urothelia. In contrast to the tumor suppressive function
of p53, over-expression of select p63 splice variants is observed in many
squamous carcinomas suggesting that p63 may act as an oncogene. Undoubtedly, the 
biochemical and biological activities attributed to p63 over the next several
years will be diverse and regulation of the p63 gene and its several protein
products complex. The use of various model systems and the study of human disease
should continue to lead to rapid advances in our understanding of the role of p63
in development, epithelial cell maintenance and tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The molecular etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is
currently unknown. It was reported that DeltaNp63 is dominant-negative toward
transactivation of p53, and associated with the malignant hyperplasia and
dedifferentiation of the squamous cells. This study was designed to investigate
the expression and significance of DeltaNp63 protein in NPC tissues.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical method was used to determine the expression of
DeltaNp63 in 60 cases of NPC, 37 cases of nearby mucosa of the carcinoma, and 30 
cases of chronic inflammation of nasopharyngeal mucosa. The classification of the
60 NPC cases were as follows: 3 cases of keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas,
57 cases of nonkeratinizing carcinomas including 12 cases of undifferentiated
carcinomas.
RESULTS: All 60 NPC cases showed DeltaNp63 positive reaction. Keratinizing
squamous cell carcinomas showed weakly positive expression; 66.67% (38/57) of
nonkeratinizing carcinomas showed strongly positive reaction, and 83.33% (10/12) 
of undifferentiated carcinomas showed strongly positive reaction. Chronic
inflammation mucosas and cancer nearby mucosas showed positive reaction only in
their basal and superbasal cells.
CONCLUSION: DeltaNp63 protein was found to be closely associated with cell
malignant hyperplasia. DeltaNp63 protein has distinct tendency to the infantile
or anaplastic squamous cells, and DeltaNp63 protein is a valuable diagnostic
marker for anaplastic squamous cells.

The p63 gene encodes six protein isoforms. The transactivating isoforms have
similar actions with p53, while the N-isoforms inhibit transcription activation
by p53 and transactivating isoforms. p63 is expressed in stratified epithelia and
in basal cells of the prostate and salivary glands. In mammary epithelium p63 has
been shown to be expressed only in the myoepithelial layer. In the present study 
we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of p63, in benign and
malignant breast lesions, and compared it with known myoepithelial cell markers. 
Our material consisted of 140 benign and 126 malignant breast lesions. We used
the antibodies anti-p63, anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin, anti-S-100 protein and
anti-cytokeratin 14. In all benign lesions, p63 immunoreactivity was noted in the
myoepithelial cell layer surrounding the luminal epithelial cells. A less
continuous peripheral rim of myoepithelial cells was also highlighted with
p63-staining in all situ carcinomas. All invasive breast carcinomas were devoided
of peripheral p63 staining. Interestingly, strong nuclear p63 immunoreactivity
was noted in a small fraction (5-15%) of epithelial cells in all cases of
papillomatosis, in 62.5% of in situ ductal papillary-type carcinomas and in 33.3%
of invasive papillary carcinomas. Comparable staining was observed with S-100.
The stromal cells were unreactive to p63. Our findings suggest that p63 is a
sensitive and specific myoepithelial marker, and may be included in
immunohistochemical panels aiming to identify myoepithelial cells in problematic 
breast lesions. Regarding papillary neoplasms, it is possible that tumor cells
acquire and exhibit at least in part a myoepithelial differentiation program.

p63 expression in sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinomas with eosinophilia arising 
in the thyroid.

Primary sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinomas with eosinophilia (SMECE) of the
thyroid gland are rare tumors that can present diagnostic difficulties to the
pathologist due to the unusual histologic features. Furthermore, the etiology of 
these tumors has been debated in the literature, with some authors believing that
the tumors arise from remnants of the ultimobranchial body (UBB, solid cell
nests) and others proposing that they arise from follicular epithelial cells.
Because SMECE often occur in glands with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and UBB 
hyperplasia, and do not stain like follicular or parafollicular cells, it is
likely that the tumors do arise from UBB/solid cell nests. In this study, we
provide additional evidence for this relationship, by demonstrating that SMECE
stain strongly positive for p63, which is a new marker for UBB/solid cell nests.

Roles of p63 in the diethylstilbestrol-induced cervicovaginal adenosis.

Women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero develop abnormalities,
including cervicovaginal adenosis that can lead to cancer. We report that
transient disruption of developmental signals by DES permanently changes
expression of p63, thereby altering the developmental fate of Müllerian duct
epithelium. The cell fate of Müllerian epithelium to be columnar (uterine) or
squamous (cervicovaginal) is determined by mesenchymal induction during the
perinatal period. Cervicovaginal mesenchyme induced p63 in Müllerian duct
epithelium and subsequent squamous differentiation. In p63(-/-) mice,
cervicovaginal epithelium differentiated into uterine epithelium. Thus, p63 is an
identity switch for Müllerian duct epithelium to be cervicovaginal versus
uterine. P63 was also essential for uterine squamous metaplasia induced by
DES-exposure. DES-exposure from postnatal day 1 to 5 inhibited induction of p63
in cervicovaginal epithelium via epithelial ERalpha. The inhibitory effect of DES
was transient, and most cervicovaginal epithelial cells recovered expression of
p63 by 2 days after discontinuation of DES-treatment. However, some
cervicovaginal epithelial cells failed to express p63, remained columnar and
persisted into adulthood as adenosis.

Myoepithelial cell carcinoma (MCC) of the salivary gland is a rare entity. Here, 
we describe the karyotype of MCC. The patient was a 53-year-old man, with a
rapidly growing lesion of the palate. Despite complete surgical excision, radio- 
and chemotherapy, the lesion rapidly harboured local and distant metastases
leading to the death of the patient, 4 months after the diagnosis. On
histological and ultrastructural examination, the primary tumour and the related 
metastases were composed of oval and spindle cells, with features of
myoepithelial cell differentiation reported in the literature. Cytogenetic
analysis showed a composite karyotype in the primary tumour: 45-46,XY, +3[cp3]/
44-45,XY, -17[cp4]/ 46,XY[5]. The lymph-node metastasis was near-triploid and
showed a complex karyotype. Our cytogenetic data differ from those described in
benign or slowly growing salivary gland tumours showing myoepithelial cell
differentiation. It is suggested that highly aggressive tumours might follow a
different pathway of malignant transformation.

AIM: To determine the immunohistochemical characteristics of putative corneal
epithelial stem cells remaining on limbal explants maintained in culture.
METHODS: Human limbal explant cultures were generated from 25 residual
corneoscleral donor rims following penetrating keratoplasty. Serial sections of
these explants were studied using immunohistochemical techniques with a panel of 
antibodies, on day 0 and 1, 2, and 3 weeks.
RESULTS: The number of epithelial cells expressing cytokeratin 19 and vimentin
increased with duration in culture, while the number of cells expressing
cytokeratin 3 decreased. Connexin 43 expression was lost by 1 week in culture.
p63 was expressed by cells that had migrated around the explant and the number of
p63 positive cells decreased with longer duration in culture. The explants were
initially negative for Ki67, but the epithelial cells were positive at 1 week,
and expression of Ki67 was progressively lost with increasing duration in
culture. The initial uniform staining of the epithelium for epidermal growth
factor receptor and alpha enolase remained unchanged at 3 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an expansion of less differentiated (cytokeratin 3 negative
and CK19/vimentin positive) epithelial cells on corneoscleral explants maintained
in culture for 3 weeks. The pattern of expression of p63 noted in this study does
not support the suggestion that it is a marker of limbal stem cells. The decline 
in p63 and Ki67 expression among the epithelial cells of the cultured explant
button implies that as the epithelial sheet outgrowing from the explant button
reaches confluence, the proliferative status of the cells remaining on the
explant button declines. These findings are of clinical relevance as explants of 
limbal tissue are used in limbal stem cell transplantation. There is no
information available to date on the fate of epithelial cells on such explants.
This study provides some insight into this and suggests that an expansion of the 
stem cell pool or its progeny may occur in limbal explants.

BACKGROUND: There have been some reports on the relationship between p53 and
keloid formation. However, there have been no studies comparing the p53
expression among scars in various stages of maturity. However, p63 and p73 have
been identified as p53-related genes and have been found to be similar to p53 in 
their structures and functions and these proteins have also been suggested to
relate to scar formation.
OBJECTIVE: We investigate the expression of three proteins of the p53 family in
scars with various clinical manifestations and discuss the shared features and
differences of these proteins.
METHODS: Forty untreated scar lesions consisting of keloids, hypertrophic scars, 
and atrophic scars were prepared for investigation. We detected the expression of
p53, p63 and p73 proteins using Western blot analysis and histopathological study
in each sample.
RESULTS: The 40 lesions were divided into four groups according to their clinical
manifestations: keloid (Group A), red hypertrophic scar (Group B), white and hard
hypertrophic scar (Group C), atrophic white scar (Group D). In Groups A and B,
the histopathological findings demonstrated increased fibroblasts, capillary
vessels and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In Group C, most of these changes
decreased but proliferation of collagen fibers was evident. In Group D, the
degree of proliferation of collagen fibers was much less and capillary vessels
and infiltration of inflammatory cells were not evident. The levels of p53
protein elevated in Groups A, B and C and were higher in order of Groups A, B and
C. In Group D, the level of p53 was almost the same as that of the control. The
level of p63 protein was almost the same as that of the control in all groups.
The level of p73 protein was elevated only in Group C.
CONCLUSION: The p53 family members behave in a different manner in various scar
tissues. It is suggested that these proteins play different roles in scar
formation and the development of unfavorable scars.

The role of p63 in development and differentiation of the epidermis.

Expression of p63, a transcription factor that is transcribed into six isoforms, 
is required for proper development of stratified epithelia, such as the
epidermis. In the absence of p63, epithelia remain single-layered. The molecular 
role of p63 in development and differentiation of stratified epithelia, however, 
remains controversial. Based on recent studies, we now believe that p63 has a
dual role and is essential for development as well as maintenance of the
epidermis. During embryogenesis, p63 may be the molecular switch required for
initiation of epithelial stratification. This is based on our recent data
demonstrating that ectopic expression of a p63 isoform in single-layered
epithelia results in the induction of a stratification program. Furthermore, in
the mature epidermis, p63 may maintain the proliferative potential of basal
keratinocytes. This is suggested by the observation that p63 is primarily
expressed in the basal compartment of the epidermis, that p63 expression induces 
hyperproliferation, and that its expression needs to be downregulated for
terminal differentiation to take place. In this review, we discuss recent
evidence supporting this dual role for p63 and place it in the context of our
increasing knowledge of epidermal development and differentiation.

Prostate cancer is an increasing threat throughout the world. As a result of a
demographic shift in population, the number of men at risk for developing
prostate cancer is growing rapidly. For 2002, an estimated 189,000 prostate
cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S., accompanied by an estimated 30,200
prostate cancer deaths [Jemal et al., 2002]. Most prostate cancer is now
diagnosed in men who were biopsied as a result of an elevated serum PSA (>4
ng/ml) level detected following routine screening. Autopsy studies [Breslow et
al., 1977; Yatani et al., 1982; Sakr et al., 1993], and the recent results of the
Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) [Thompson et al., 2003], a large scale
clinical trial where all men entered the trial without an elevated PSA (<3 ng/ml)
were subsequently biopsied, indicate the prevalence of histologic prostate cancer
is much higher than anticipated by PSA screening. Environmental factors, such as 
diet and lifestyle, have long been recognized contributors to the development of 
prostate cancer. Recent studies of the molecular alterations in prostate cancer
cells have begun to provide clues as to how prostate cancer may arise and
progress. For example, while inflammation in the prostate has been suggested
previously as a contributor to prostate cancer development [Gardner and Bennett, 
1992; Platz, 1998; De Marzo et al., 1999; Nelson et al., 2003], research
regarding the genetic and pathological aspects of prostate inflammation has only 
recently begun to receive attention. Here, we review the subject of inflammation 
and prostate cancer as part of a "chronic epithelial injury" hypothesis of
prostate carcinogenesis, and the somatic genome and phenotypic changes
characteristic of prostate cancer cells. We also present the implications of
these changes for prostate cancer diagnosis, detection, prevention, and
treatment.

The TP73 gene encodes a nuclear protein that has high homology with TP53. TP73 is
rarely mutated in human cancer. The presence of a 1-kb regulatory fragment within
the first intron of TP73 was recently reported. This fragment exerts silencer
activity on TP73 mediated by ZEB. We searched for possible mutations in this
negative regulatory region in 45 colorectal and 43 breast cancer patients and in 
34 healthy donors. The study was carried out using the SSCP method, and the
allelic variants detected were sequenced. The expression of TP73 was analyzed by 
quantitative RT-PCR, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was assessed by
microsatellite study. In several samples, we identified an allele variant that
corresponds to a deletion of 73 bp in tumor tissues and normal counterparts,
localized between -489 and -417 from the ATG start site of exon 2. Among the 88
tumor samples, 35 (40%) showed at least 1 allele with the cited deletion, versus 
7 of the 34 (21%) healthy donors (P = 0.045). When we classified the patients
according to the number of variations into homozygous or heterozygous groups, the
significance was clearer (P = 0.03). No LOH was detected in the heterozygous
cases. There was a positive quantitative correlation between the expression of
TP73 and the presence of the allelic variant (P = 0.029). These data suggest that
this allelic variant is common in breast and colorectal cancers and that it could
alter the expression of the TP73 gene with an additive effect.

From snails to sciatic nerve: Retrograde injury signaling from axon to soma in
lesioned neurons.

The cell body of a lesioned neuron must receive accurate and timely information
on the site and extent of axonal damage, in order to mount an appropriate
response. Specific mechanisms must therefore exist to transmit such information
along the length of the axon from the lesion site to the cell body. Three
distinct types of signals have been postulated to underlie this process, starting
with injury-induced discharge of axon potentials, and continuing with two
distinct types of retrogradely transported macromolecular signals. The latter
include, on the one hand, an interruption of the normal supply of retrogradely
transported trophic factors from the target; and on the other hand activated
proteins emanating from the injury site. These activated proteins are termed
"positive injury signals", and are thought to be endogenous axoplasmic proteins
that undergo post-translational modifications at the lesion site upon axotomy,
which then target them to the retrograde transport system for trafficking to the 
cell body. Here, we summarize the work to date supporting the positive retrograde
injury signal hypothesis, and provide some new and emerging proteomic data on the
system. We propose that the retrograde positive injury signals form part of a
complex that is assembled by a combination of different processes, including
post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, regulated and transient
proteolysis, and local axonal protein synthesis.

Does the correlation between EBNA-1 and p63 expression in breast carcinomas
provide a clue to tumorigenesis in Epstein-Barr virus-related breast

Several investigators have identified Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) particles in
breast carcinomas, a fact that supports a role for EBV in mammary tumorigenesis. 
The possible mechanism involved in this process is not clear. The present study
was carried out in an attempt to determine whether there is a relationship
between latent infection with EBV and p53 and p63 expression in breast
carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry developed with 3.3-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride was performed in 85 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast
carcinomas using anti-EBV EBNA-1, anti-p63, anti-p53, anti-estrogen receptor (ER)
and anti-progesterone receptor (PR) antibodies. The cases were selected to
represent each of the various histologic types: intraductal carcinoma (N=12),
grade I invasive ductal carcinoma (N=15), grade II invasive ductal carcinoma
(N=15), grade III invasive ductal carcinoma (N=15), tubular carcinoma (N=8),
lobular carcinoma (N=10), and medullary carcinoma (N=10). The ductal breast
carcinomas were graded I, II and III based on the Scarff-Bloom and Richardson
grading system modified by Elston and Ellis. One slide containing at least 1000
neoplastic cells was examined in each case. ER, PR, p63, p53 and EBNA-1 were
positive in 60, 40, 11.8, 21.2 and 37.6% of carcinomas, respectively. There was a
correlation between EBNA-1 and p63 expression (P<0.001), but not between EBNA-1
and p53 (P=0.10). These data suggest a possible role for p63 in the mammary
tumorigenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.

PURPOSE: To investigate the phenotype of fetal and adult human limbal cells
cultured on human amniotic membrane and the ability of cultured adult human
limbal cells to repair limbal stem cell deficiency in a rabbit model.
METHODS: Human adult and fetal limbal cells were isolated and cultured either on 
plastic plates or on human amniotic membrane. Connexin43, p63, and keratins 3 and
12 (K3 and K12) were detected by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Limbal stem cell 
deficiency was established in rabbits using chemical ablation and mechanical
debridement. Cultured adult human limbal cells were transplanted onto rabbit
corneas one month after injury, then fixed and imbedded in paraffin forty days
later. Immunofluorescent staining of human-nuclear antigen, p63, K3, and
connexin43 identified human-specific cells, progenitor cells, and differentiated 
corneal epithelial cells, respectively.
RESULTS: Adult and fetal cultured limbal cells appeared similar in morphology.
RT-PCR results showed that cells cultured from the human adult and fetal limbal
area expressed both p63 and K12, whereas cells from central adult epithelium
expressed K12 only. Immunofluorescent staining showed that more cells were p63
positive when cultured on human amniotic membrane than on plastic. Double
staining for p63 and connexin43 showed some p63-positive cells co-expressing
connexin43. After transplantation of adult human limbal cells cultured on human
amniotic membrane, injured rabbit corneas were completely reconstructed
exhibiting epithelial integrity, improved corneal clarity, and little or no
neovascularization. The majority of repopulated epithelial cells expressed
anti-human nuclear antibody. Cells expressing p63 occurred throughout the new
epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS: During healing, expression of p63 is not limited to epithelial stem 
cells but may also mark transient amplifying progenitor cells. Culture on human
amniotic membrane suppresses differentiation of limbal epithelial cells and
promotes the proliferation of p63 expressing cells. Amniotic membrane-cultured
human limbal cells fully reconstructed rabbit corneas having limbal stem cell
deficiency, with human cells providing most of the cells of the new epithelium.
Expression p63 is distributed throughout the reconstructed tissue.

p51/p63, a member of the p53 gene family, is structurally conserved among a wide 
range of organisms, although the transactivator (TA) and N-terminally truncated
(deltaN) isotype producing property seems to vary. Since p51/p63 is thought to
play important roles in skin, limb, and craniofacial development in mammals, we
examined Xenopus laevis larval and adult tissues for expression of p51/p63.
Temporal analyses indicated enhanced transcription of the deltaN form of p51/p63 
in premetamorphosis phase (at stage 44-48). p51/p63-positive cells in the inner
layer of larval skin expanded to the suprabasal layers during the stratification.
The epithelium of limb buds and the maxillofacial ectodermal tissues in tadpoles 
had a high level expression of p51/p63. The cloned deltaN-A/gamma type Xenopus
p51/p63 exhibited a dominant-negative activity against the human TA-A/gamma
isotype in a reporter assay. These results suggest that tissue-specific
p51/p63-inducing mechanism and isotype-specific transcriptional regulator
activities of p51/p63 are conserved between mammals and frogs.

The transcription factor and tumour suppressor p53 and its two homologues p63 and
p73 form a family of proteins. p63 and p73 show much greater molecular complexity
than p53 because they are expressed both as multiple alternatively spliced
C-terminal isoforms, and as N-terminally deleted, dominant-negative proteins that
show reciprocal functional regulation. In addition, several other factors, such
as post-translational modifications and specific and common family regulatory
proteins, result overall in subtle modulation of their biological effects.
Although all p53, p63 and p73 family members are regulators of the cell cycle and
apoptosis, the developmental abnormalities of p73- and p63-null mice do not show 
enhanced tumour susceptibility of p53 knockouts, suggesting that complex
regulatory processes modulate the functional effects of this family of proteins.

Ectrodactyly is a congenital limb malformation that involves a central reduction 
defect of the hands and/or feet which is frequently associated with other
phenotypic abnormalities. The condition appears to be genetically heterogeneous
and recently it has been demonstrated that mutations in the p63 gene, a homologue
of the tumor suppressor gene p53, are the cause of at least four autosomal
dominant genetic syndromes which feature ectrodactyly: ectrodactyly, ectodermal
dysplasia, and facial clefting (EEC), split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM), 
limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), and acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome
(ADULT). In this study, genetic analysis of the p63 gene in a group of 13
patients with ectrodactyly (syndromic and isolated) was performed. Four patients 
with syndromic ectrodactyly had p63 heterozygous point mutations that affect the 
DNA binding domain of the protein. One of these subjects exhibited the typical
features of EEC syndrome as well as ankyloblepharon being, to our knowledge, the 
first case combining these traits. This finding supports the view of a clinical
overlap in this group of autosomal dominant syndromes caused by p63 mutations and
demonstrates that there are exceptions in the previously established p63
genotype-phenotype correlation.

PURPOSE: p63 is proposed to play roles in normal development and differentiation 
of stratified epithelia including urothelium. We recently reported that impaired 
p63 expression is a common feature of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinomas
and associates with reduced beta-catenin. On the basis of these facts, we
proposed that impaired p63 expression contributes to biological aggressiveness of
urothelial neoplasms. Uroplakin (UP) III expression was also evaluated to
investigate a possible association between loss of p63 expression and terminal
urothelial differentiation.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of p63, beta-catenin, and UP III was
immunohistochemically analyzed in 75 cystectomy specimens of high-grade invasive 
bladder carcinoma. p63 expression was semiquantified and compared with
pathological parameters, expression of beta-catenin and UP III, and
cancer-specific survival.
RESULTS: Lower p63 expression was significantly associated with higher
Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0.0004), lymph-node metastasis (P =
0.013), and reduced beta-catenin expression (P = 0.003). By univariate analysis, 
lower p63 expression, along with TNM stage and lymph-node status, were
significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P = 0.0005), whereas reduced
beta-catenin was not. By multivariate analysis, the prognostic effect of p63
expression was independent of TNM stage and lymph-node status with marginal
statistical significance (P = 0.074). UP III expression was restricted to a
subset of p63-negative carcinoma cells, including even anaplastic carcinoma
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired p63 expression characterizes biological aggressiveness of
high-grade invasive urothelial carcinomas. Moreover, loss of p63 expression is a 
prerequisite for UP III expression. Our data suggest that p63 plays critical
roles in tumor progression and biochemical terminal differentiation of urothelial
neoplasms.

Five cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the breast are reported. All
patients were women ranging in age from 29 years to 80 years. As histological
grading is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast invasive
carcinomas, MEC was graded using the Auclair et al. [1] grading system specific
for MEC of salivary glands and the Elston and Ellis [4] grading method, a widely 
employed grading system in breast cancer. It was found that the two different
grading systems appear to be interchangeable in assessing the grade of MEC of the
breast. Accordingly, three cases were regarded low grade (G. 1), one intermediate
(G. 2) and one high grade (G. 3). The cases were studied with
immunohistochemistry and were found to have the same keratin pattern shown by
their salivary gland counterpart. It was found that there are more similarities
than differences between MEC of the breast and of salivary glands.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the relation between p63, 
p53-related gene, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and spontaneous
apoptosis in relation to radiotherapy in patients with FIGO stage IIB cervical
carcinoma, who had undergone radiation and concurrent chemotherapy,
retrospectively.
METHODS: Eighty-four patients with FIGO stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
of the uterine cervix, who were treated with radiotherapy and concurrent
chemotherapy between 1991 and 1996, were included in the present study. The
clinicopathologic features, patterns of treatment failure, and survival data were
compared with the expressions of p63 and EGFR, which were determined by
immunohistochemistry and with apoptosis by TUNEL on tissue-arrayed slides.
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic
factors that influence patient survival.
RESULTS: Overall the indices of the expressions of p63 and EGFR in stage IIB
cervical carcinoma were 18.7 and 26.6%, respectively, and these were found to be 
correlated. EGFR expression was significantly associated with extrapelvic failure
(P = 0.03), whereas p63 was associated with locoregional failure (P = 0.03). The 
spontaneous apoptotic index showed no prognostic value, but the
immunoreactivities of p63 and EGFR were associated with a worse prognosis by both
univariate (P = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively) and multivariate analysis (95%
CI:2.0-4.4, RR:3.2 and 95% CI:4.9-8.7, RR:6.7, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of p63 gene is associated with poor survival and
locoregional failure, whereas EGFR expression was found to be a prognostic
predictor of extrapelvic failure. Both molecules were found to be potent
molecular risk factors in patients with FIGO stage IIB SCC of the uterine cervix,
who had received radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.

The tumour suppressor activity of p53 plays a major role in limiting abnormal
proliferation, and inactivation of the p53 response is becoming increasingly
accepted as a hallmark of cancer. In contrast, both p63 and p73, which are close 
relatives of p53, are rarely mutated in tumour cells. At a theoretical level,
therapeutic approaches that reinstate p53 activity, or augment p63 and p73,
provide plausible and potentially efficacious routes towards new cancer
treatments. Equally important is the clinical need to increase the efficacy of
conventional anti-cancer drugs. Incapacitating the p53 response to limit the side
effects in healthy cells may be one approach towards increasing the therapeutic
window of many current anti-cancer drugs. Nevertheless, while cancer drug
discovery focussed on p53 is an exciting and realistic possibility, translating
this concept into a clinical setting is likely to be challenging.

ING1b can stimulate cell cycle arrest, repair, senescence, and apoptosis. The
actions of ING1b are attributed to its activation of the tumor suppressor p53.
Here we investigate the more subtle effects of ING1b on the cell cycle and DNA
damage responses in the absence of p53. To this end, we have generated isogenic
cell lines that expressed ING1b and p53 either individually or in combination
under the control of inducible promoters. A five- to 10-fold induction of ING1b
over the endogenous protein in a p53-null H1299 background slightly impairs
proliferation by increasing the doubling time by approximately 10%.
Significantly, ectopic expression of ING1b enhanced the G(2)/M DNA damage
checkpoint induced by adriamycin. We demonstrated that the DNA damage-induced
cell death mediated by the cooperation between ING1b and p53 was more prominent
than by the individual proteins alone. In adriamycin-treated cells, p53 was
stabilized and induced the expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1), but the expression of
ING1b was not affected. The exact targets of ING1b in the p53-null background are
not known, but we demonstrated that the transcriptional activities of other
members of the p53 family, p63alpha and p73alpha, could be activated by ING1b.
These data indicate that ING1 has a subtle antiproliferative effect even in the
absence of p53, and ING1b enhances the DNA damage responses through p53-dependent
and -independent mechanisms.

p63, a member of the p53 gene family, is known to encode functionally
antagonistic protein isoforms. Although transactivating protein isoforms display 
p53-like functions, deltaNp63 isoforms act toward p53 in a dominant negative way.
Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of pan-p63 and deltaNp63
in 50 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) as well as in squamous low-grade
intraepithelial neoplasias (S-LGINs; n = 4) and high-grade intraepithelial
neoplasias (S-HGINs; n = 18). Additionally, 50 esophageal adenocarcinomas (ADCs) 
that arose in Barrett's esophagus (BE) as well as adjacent specialized
metaplastic epithelium (SE; n = 41), low-grade intraepithelial neoplasias
(B-LGINs; n = 27), and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias (B-HGINs; n = 21) in
BE were investigated. Furthermore, p63 gene amplification was determined by
fluorescent differential polymerase chain reaction in a subset of 10 SCCs and 10 
ADCs. Whereas in normal esophageal epithelium, expression of pan-p63 is
invariably restricted to the basal cell layer, in 100% of S-LGINs, 94.4% of
S-HGINs, and 88.0% of SCCs, expression of p63 was found in >75% of the cells.
Concerning BE, only in a small subset of SEs (7.3%), B-LGINs (14.8%), B-HGINs
(14.3%) and ADCs (16.0%) was a weak p63 protein expression (<10% positive cells) 
detectable, whereas the rest of the samples were completely negative. Expression 
of deltaNp63 was identical to expression of pan-p63 in the vast majority of
samples. p63 gene amplification was found in 2 of 10 (20.0%) investigated SCCs
and in 1 of 10 (10.0%) ADCs. In summary, strong expression of p63, especially its
deltaNp63 isoforms, is a frequent finding in esophageal precancerous and
cancerous squamous lesions, whereas this is not the case in carcinogenesis of BE.
p63 gene amplification is an infrequent finding in esophageal SCCs and ADCs and
does not correlate with protein overexpression.

While the p53 homologue p73 has been found to be involved in tumorigenesis, the
molecular mechanisms involved in this function are still not fully evident. The
presence of two distinct promoters allows the formation of two proteins with
opposite effects: while TA-p73 shows pro-apoptotic effects, DeltaN-p73 has an
evident anti-apoptotic function. The relative expression of the two proteins is
in fact related to the prognosis of several cancers. Since both p73 and p63, the 
other member of the same family, share the ability to interact with each other,
it is important to understand the mechanisms that control the degradation and
stability of both proteins, and their relative isoforms. p73 and p63 stability is
regulated not only by protein modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation) but
also by its degradation in the proteasome. To this end, the interaction with
Mdm2, p300/CBP, and SUMO-1 are discussed in details.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a reproducible method of isolating an intact viable human
limbal epithelial sheet.
METHODS: Human pigmented limbus was incubated at 4 degrees C for 18 hours in
supplemental hormonal epithelial medium (SHEM) containing 50 mg/mL dispase II and
100 mM sorbitol. A loose limbal epithelial sheet was separated by a spatula. The 
remaining stroma was digested and subcultured. The viability of isolated cells
was assessed. Isolated epithelial sheets and remaining stroma were subjected to
immunostaining. Sheets 1.5 mm in length were cultured in SHEM on plastic until
confluence, and cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Intact limbal epithelial sheets were consistently isolated. Pigmented
palisades of Vogt revealed large superficial squamous cells and small basal
cuboidal cells. No epithelial cells grew from the remaining stroma. Mean
viability was 80.7% +/- 9.1%. The basal epithelium was negative to keratin 3 and 
connexin 43, but was scatter positive for p63. The epithelial sheet showed
negative staining for laminin 5 and collagen VII, but interrupted linear basal
staining for collagen IV. The remaining stroma showed negative staining for
laminin 5, positive linear staining for collagen IV in the basement membrane, and
diffuse staining for collagen VII in the superior stroma subjacent to the
basement membrane. Western blot analysis revealed that cells originating from the
limbal sheets expressed keratin 3 and p63.
CONCLUSIONS: An intact limbal epithelial sheet can be consistently and
reproducibly isolated and contains stem cell characteristics in the basal
epithelium by degrading laminin 5 and part of collagen IV, and disassembling
collagen VII.

p63 proteins are p53 homologs that are postulated to regulate squamous stem cell 
commitment. An immunohistochemical survey of p63 expression in normal thyroid and
in reactive, neoplastic, and inflammatory thyroid disorders was performed.
Sections from routinely fixed and processed archival thyroidectomy specimens were
pretreated with citric acid, pH 6.0, for antigen retrieval, then incubated
overnight with anti-p63 monoclonal antibody 4A4. Slides were stained using a
streptavidin-biotin kit and diaminobenzidine as a chromagen, and then were
counterstained with hematoxylin. The results showed that p63 expression was
negative in normal thyroid tissue, nodular goiters, and oncocytic follicular
adenomas. Positivity was rare and weak in follicular adenomas. p63-positive foci 
were commonly found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (1 or more foci in 78.8% of
cases), but rare in Graves' disease. Twenty-seven of 33 papillary thyroid
carcinomas (81.8%) displayed p63-positive foci. Staining was uncommon in
follicular carcinomas and rare in medullary carcinomas. One case of insular
carcinoma was p63-positive. All squamoid structures were p63-positive;
p63-positive structures morphologically consistent with solid cell nests were
also identified. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that p63 is
commonly expressed in papillary thyroid carcinoma and in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Given the debated association of papillary thyroid carcinoma with Hashimoto's
thyroiditis, it is possible that p63 expression may be a potential pathobiologic 
link between the two disorders. The finding of p63 in benign squamoid nests
supports a possible interrelationship between these structures and both
Hashimoto's thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma. The high percentage of papillary
carcinomas with p63-positive foci appears to distinguish papillary carcinoma from
other neoplasms originating in the thyroid.

Abnormalities in the p53 gene are regarded as the most consistent of the genetic 
abnormalities in oral squamous-cell carcinoma. Two new members of the p53 gene
family, p73 and p63, have recently been identified, with the three sharing
considerable sequence homology at the acidic N-terminal transactivation, central 
DNA-binding and C-terminal oligomerization domains, indicating possible
functional and biological interactions. The differential expression of p73, p63
and p53 genes in human oral squamous-cell carcinoma does not yet appear to be
completely understood, however. In this study, therefore, immunohistochemical
analysis of protein expression was performed for 40 samples of
well-differentiated human buccal squamous-cell carcinomas, with 10 specimens of
normal buccal mucosa employed as controls. Differential expressions of p63, p73
and p53 proteins in the carcinoma samples were: p63+/p73+/p53 + (n = 28; 70%);
p63+/p73+/p53- (n = 4; 10%); p63+/p73-/p53- (n = 8; 20%), respectively; and
p63+/p73+/p53- for normal mucosa (n = 10; 100%). A significant correlation
between p53, p63 and p73 immunoexpression was demonstrated for the buccal
squamous-cell carcinoma samples (P < 0.0001; Fisher's exact test). Significance
was not achieved for the correlation between p73 and p53 immunoexpression and
clinicopathological parameters for buccal carcinomas (P > 0.05; Fisher's exact
test). Our results indicate that both p73 and p63 may be involved in the
development of human buccal squamous-cell carcinoma, perhaps in concert with p53.

We performed an integrated cytogenetic study using a combination of comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH), spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) to analyze chromosomal aberrations associated with 8 human
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EC-SCC) cell lines, and used real-time
quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) to study the copy number changes of two candidate genes 
of chromosome 3q, PIK3CA and TP63, in 20 primary tumors of EC-SCC. The pooled CGH
results revealed frequent gain abnormalities on chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 3q, 5p,
6p, 7p, 7q, 8q, 9q, 11q, 12p, 14q, 15q, 16p, 16q, 17q, 18p, 19q, 20q, 22q, and
Xq, while frequent losses were found on 3p, 4, 5q, 6q, 7q, 9p, and 18q. SKY
detected 195 translocations, 13 deletions and 2 duplications. Among the 374
breakpoints, most clustered at the centromeric regions, such as 8q10, 13q10,
7q10, 9q10, 14q10, 15q10, 16q10, 21q10, and 22q10, but also at other regions,
including 3q (3q21, 3q22, 3q25), 7p (7p22, 7p14, 7p12), 7q (7q21, 7q31, 7q32), 8q
(8q21.1, 8q23), 11q (11q21, 11q24), 13q (13q14) and 18q (18q21). There was a good
correlation between the number of aberrations identified by CGH and SKY (r=0.667;
p=0.035). Combined CGH and SKY analyses indicated that chromosomes 3, 7, 9, 11,
14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 22 harbored higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations
than expected. FISH using BAC clones containing oncogene PIK3CA and TP63 found
that both genes were amplified in 6 and 5 cell lines, respectively. Q-PCR
analysis of primary tumors revealed amplification of PIK3CA and TP63 in 100% and 
80% of the cases. Average copy number of PIK3CA per haploid genome was greater
than that of TP63 (6.27 vs 2.73), and the difference showed statistical
significance (p<0.001). Combination of CGH, SKY and FISH could reveal detailed
chromosomal changes associated with esophageal cancer cells, and Q-PCR could
assess the change of the candidate genes in clinical samples in a high throughput
way.

Two homologs of the tumor suppressor p53, named p63 and p73, are each expressed
from at least two start sites of mRNA synthesis, yielding full-length,
transactivating (TA) isoforms, and also aminoterminally truncated (DeltaN)
isoforms that act as antagonists to p53. The expression of TAp73-transcripts is
induced by E2F and negatively regulated by transforming growth factor beta
(TGFbeta). The DeltaNp73 promoter is induced by p53, resulting in negative
feedback to control p53 activity. Here, we have analysed the expression of p63 in
comparison with p73. In contrast to the induction of DeltaNp73, the expression of
DeltaNp63 was reduced by p53 particularly in human keratinocytes, at the mRNA and
protein levels. Accordingly, the 3' promoter of p73, but not that of p63, was
activated by p53 in reporter assays. DeltaNp73 mRNA and DeltaNp73 protein, but
not the p63 gene products, also accumulated when HaCat cells (lacking functional 
p53) were grown to high density. TAp73, but not TAp63, expression was suppressed 
by TGFbeta in these cells, and the TAp73, but not the TAp63, promoter was induced
by E2F-1. Thus, in contrast to the functional similarities of their respective
products, the expression levels of p63 and p73 are regulated by different
mechanisms. This might be responsible for the discordant biological roles of p63 
and p73 in development, as well as their deviant expression characteristics in
cancer.

The Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS, MIM 129400) corresponds to a rare form of
anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which shares some features with the
ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome (EEC, MIM
604292) resulting from TP63 mutations. We report here, in two unrelated patients 
with RHS, the identification of two distinct TP63 mutations, corresponding to a
novel frameshift mutation (1709DelA, exon 14) located downstream the sterile
alpha motif (SAM) domain and to a missense mutation (R279H, exon 7) within the
DNA binding domain. Functional analysis of the R279H mutation, which had
previously been reported in several EEC families, shows that this mutation
disrupted the dominant negative activity of the DeltaNp63alpha and gamma isoforms
on the transcriptional activity of TP53. This report shows, on a molecular basis,
that RHS is also an EEC-like syndrome resulting from mutations of the TP63 gene, 
and highlights the wide phenotypic spectrum associated to TP63 mutations.

We present a sporadic case of a Japanese female infant with ectodermal dysplasia,
complete cleft lip and palate, severe skin erosions at birth and recurrent scalp 
infection. She had typical clinical features of ankyloblepharon, ectodermal
defects and cleft lip and palate (AEC) syndrome without ankyloblepharon.
Histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed reduced granular cell layers
and aberrant expression of the p63 protein in the suprabasal keratinocytes.
Mutation analysis of the exon 13 of p63 gene revealed a heterozygous in-frame
3-bp insert (c. 538-539 ins TTC) encoding additional amino acid residues (F).
This is the first report of sterile alpha motif domain mutation except for single
nucleotide transitions.

Cancer Research, London, UK.

p63, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 and CK 14 have been employed in diagnostic pathology as
markers of basal, squamous and myoepithelial differentiation in several types of 
human neoplasms; however, there is scant data on the concurrent expression of
these markers in large series of human neoplasms. We analyzed the distribution of
these three immunohistochemical markers in 51 normal human tissue samples, 350
carcinomas, 25 malignant melanomas (MMs), and 25 glioblastomas using three serial
sections of tissue array research program (TARP)-4 multi-tumor tissue microarray.
Also, we performed double immunostainings to characterize the differential
distribution of p63/CK 5/6 and p63/CK 14 in normal breast, salivary gland and
skin. p63, CK 5/6 and CK 14 were expressed in basal cells of the prostate and
respiratory epithelia and in breast and bronchial myoepithelial cells. p63 was
also expressed in cytotrophoblast cells of human placenta and in scattered cells 
of lymph node germinal center. CK 5/6 and CK 14 also stained the cytoplasm of
basal cells of esophageal stratified squamous epithelium and transitional
epithelial cells of the bladder. No mesenchymal, neural, endothelial, smooth
muscle or adipose cells were stained by any of the markers. p63, CK 5/6, and CK
14 were respectively expressed in 92.6%, 75.0%, and 52.9% of the squamous cell
carcinomas of the lung, 10.2%, 20.0%, and 7.4% of the ductal carcinomas of the
breast, 12.9%, 34.4%, and 11.8% of the serous and 25.0%, 0%, and 0% of the
endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary. Lung, prostate and colonic adenocarcinomas,
as well as MMs and glioblastomas were only rarely decorated by one of the
markers. Only matched samples of 16 squamous cell carcinomas and two ductal
carcinomas of the breast co-expressed these three markers. In double
immunostainings, p63-CK 5/6, as well as p63-CK 14 were co-expressed by
basal/myoepithelial cells of the salivary glands and basal cells of the

together in immunohistochemical panels to characterize squamous differentiation
in poorly differentiated carcinomas or carcinomas of unknown origin.

Expression of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) gene has recently been
demonstrated by several groups to be markedly elevated in prostate cancer cells
with little expression in benign prostate tissue and has been suggested as a
molecular marker of prostate cancer on needle biopsy. There is scant data,
however, as to the sensitivity and specificity of AMACR in the diagnosis of small
foci of cancer on needle biopsy. A total of 209 needle biopsies of the prostate
with small foci (<5% of a core) of prostatic adenocarcinoma were identified. A
total of 175 cases were received in consultation by one of the authors (140 from 
a single institution and 35 from different outside institutions) and 34 cases
were from our hospital file. Immunohistochemistry for high molecular weight
cytokeratin and p63 was performed in all cases to confirm the diagnosis of
cancer. Only AMACR staining that was significantly stronger than that of
background benign glands was considered positive; 88% of all cases of prostate
cancer were positive for AMACR. The sensitivity varied among the different
groups: 100% for the in house cases, 87.1% for the cases from a single
institution, and 80% for cases from different outside institutions. The mean
percentage of stained glands in positive cases was 95.9%, with 150 (71.8%) cases 
showing 100% of the glands positive and 25 (12.0%) cases showing no staining.
Because negative staining for basal cell markers, especially in a small focus of 
atypical glands, is not necessarily diagnostic of prostate cancer, positive
staining for AMACR can increase the level of confidence in establishing a
definitive malignant diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of AMACR staining may
vary in specimens from different pathology laboratories, possibly related to
differences in fixation and processing. It is important to optimize the staining 
technique for each laboratory and recognize that some small cancers on needle
biopsy may be AMACR negative.

Lines of evidence have recently indicated a relationship between mutations in the
P63 gene and ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (EEC) syndrome type 3
(EEC3). The p63 gene (P63) has homology to P53 known as a tumor-suppressor gene, 
but biological function of its protein has not yet been known well. There have
been two reported patients who had EEC syndrome associated with malignant
lymphoma. However, they did not undergo sequencing analysis of P63. Here, we
present with a Japanese girl who had EEC3 and developed diffuse large B-cell type
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this patient, we documented a heterozygous germline
mutation, Asp312Gly, in P63. We speculated that p63 may exert a biological
function as a tumor suppressor. Malignant lymphoma should be considered as an
important complication of EEC3.

Distribution of p63, a novel myoepithelial marker, in fine-needle aspiration
biopsies of the breast: an analysis of 82 samples.

BACKGROUND: The presence of myoepithelial cells (MECs) in fine-needle aspiration 
biopsies (FNAB) of the breast constitute an important criterion used to diagnose 
benign breast lesions. However, MECs sometimes have a distorted cytomorphology,
and most of the previously evaluated myoepithelial markers do not have
satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. p63, a recently characterized p53
homolog, is a nuclear transcription factor that is expressed in basal cells of
multilayered epithelia and myoepithelial cells of the breast. The authors
analyzed the immunocytochemical distribution of p63 in a series of 82 breast
FNABs (30 benign lesions and 52 malignant breast lesions).
METHODS: Eighty-two archival, Papanicolaou-stained smears of breast lesions were 
retrieved from the files of the authors' institutions. Immunocytochemistry was
performed according to the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique using
the antibody 4A4 (against all p63 isoforms). Two pathologists evaluated the
distribution of p63 positive cells. Only nuclear reactivity was considered
specific.
RESULTS: In benign lesions, p63 decorated the nuclei of MECs in all samples. p63 
also stained naked nuclei in fibroadenomas. In malignant lesions, p63 was
positive in MECs overlying malignant cell clusters in all 8 samples of ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS), in 9 of 16 samples of pure invasive carcinomas (IC),
and in 16 of 20 samples that contained both DCIS and IC. In 18 samples (36%), a
variable population of p63 positive, malignant cells was observed. p63 failed to 
decorate stromal, neural, adipocytic, and smooth muscle cells in all samples.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 is a reliable nuclear marker of MECs in breast aspirates.
Regardless of the fact that variable proportions of p63 positive, malignant cells
were observed in 36% of breast carcinoma aspirates, p63 may be a useful adjunct
antibody to confirm the presence of MECs in FNABs of benign breast lesions.

A singular challenge in stem cell research today is the expansion and propagation
of functional adult stem cells. Unlike embryonic stem cells, which are immortal
in culture, adult stem cells are notorious for the difficulty encountered when
attempts are made to expand them in culture. One overlooked reason for this
difficulty may be the inherent asymmetric cell kinetics of stem cells in
postnatal somatic tissues. Senescence is the expected fate of a culture whose
growth depends on adult stem cells that divide with asymmetric cell kinetics.
Therefore, the bioengineering of strategies to expand adult stem cells in culture
requires knowledge of cellular mechanisms that control asymmetric cell kinetics. 
The properties of several genes recently implicated to function in a cellular
pathway(s) that regulates asymmetric cell kinetics are discussed. Understanding
the function of these genes in asymmetric cell kinetics mechanisms may be the key
that unlocks the adult stem cell expansion problem.

deltaNp63alpha functions as both a positive and a negative transcriptional
regulator and blocks in vitro differentiation of murine keratinocytes.

deltaNp63 is overexpressed in squamous carcinomas where it is associated with
proliferation and is believed to enhance cell growth by blocking p53-mediated
transactivation. In normal epithelium, deltaNp63alpha protein expression is
abundant in basal cells and decreases with differentiation. To explore the
biological consequences of deltaNp63alpha overexpression in relation to squamous 
carcinogenesis, we evaluated its effect on normal squamous differentiation and
p53 transactivation function in keratinocytes. Forced overexpression of
deltaNp63alpha in primary murine keratinocytes in vitro inhibits morphological
differentiation induced by elevated extracellular [Ca(2+)], abrogates
Ca(2)(+)-induced growth arrest, and blocks expression of maturation-specific
proteins keratin 10 and filaggrin. This suggests that deltaNp63 overexpression in
squamous carcinomas may serve to maintain the basal cell phenotype and promote
cell survival. deltaNp63alpha blocks transactivation of p53 responsive reporter
constructs mediated by endogenous or exogenous p53 at 17 h postinfection, as
expected. However, at 41 h, when p53-mediated transactivation is diminished,
deltaNp63alpha enhances transactivation of these reporter constructs by
2.2-12-fold over control. Maximal deltaNp63alpha-induced transactivation requires
intact p53 responsive elements, but is independent of cellular p53 status. This
positive transcriptional function of deltaNp63alpha appears to be cell-type
specific, as it is not observed in primary dermal fibroblasts or Saos-2 cells.
These findings support deltaNp63alpha as a master regulator of keratinocyte
differentiation, and suggest a novel function of this protein in the maintenance 
of epithelial homeostasis.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the
p53 homologue p63 are overexpressed in a significant number of cases of head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Epidermal growth factor receptor and p63
both possess oncogenic properties, including the potential to increase cell
proliferation and antagonize apoptosis. ZD1839 ("Iressa") is an adenosine
triphosphate-competitive inhibitor specific to the EGFR tyrosine kinase currently
under evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent in HNSCC. The objective was to
investigate whether p63 expression is decreased after treatment of HNSCC cells
with ZD1839. Downregulation of p63 by ZD1839 would identify a potential molecular
relationship between EGFR signaling and p63 and could provide insight into the
mechanism of action of ZD1839.
STUDY DESIGN: In vitro examination of p63 expression after ZD1839 treatment.
METHODS: A human HNSCC cell line, SCC-012, was treated with varying doses of
ZD1839. p63 protein and messenger RNA levels were analyzed by Western and
Northern blot analyses. The effect of ZD1839 on SCC-012 cell cycle was analyzed
by flow cytometric analysis.
RESULTS: In SCC-012 cells there was a dose-dependent decrease in p63 protein and 
messenger RNA levels over the course of ZD1839 treatment. Levels of
phosphorylated MAPK decreased and p27KIP-1 levels increased after ZD1839
treatment. ZD1839 treatment induced a twofold increase in G1-phase cells and a
3.5-fold decrease in S-phase cells consistent with growth arrest.
CONCLUSION: ZD1839 downregulates p63 expression at the messenger RNA level,
suggesting that p63 is a downstream target of EGFR signaling.

Expression and diagnostic utility of alpha-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (P504S) in
foamy gland and pseudohyperplastic prostate cancer.

Foamy gland and pseudohyperplastic carcinomas are two uncommon variants of
prostate cancer and often pose diagnostic challenges on needle biopsies.
Alpha-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (AMACR) is a recently discovered tumor marker whose
expression is significantly upregulated in prostate cancer. However, the original
works only studied ordinary prostate cancer without reference to specific
morphologic variants. Therefore, the expression and diagnostic utility of AMACR
in specific variants of prostate cancer are unknown. In addition, two different
antibodies, one monoclonal and one polyclonal, were used in the previous studies.
The goal of this study is to examine the expression pattern and diagnostic
utility of AMACR in foamy gland and pseudohyperplastic prostate cancer and to
compare the diagnostic utility of the two anti-AMACR antibodies in the same
prostate needle biopsy series. Prostate cancer with foamy gland or
pseudohyperplastic features was retrieved from the Johns Hopkins Hospital
Surgical Pathology file. Thirty needle biopsies harboring prostate cancer with
foamy gland features and 17 needle biopsies harboring prostate cancer with
pseudohyperplastic features were available for this study. Immunohistochemistry
for AMACR was performed with two antibodies, a monoclonal one (P504S) and a
polyclonal one (AMACR-p), using previously published protocols.
Immunohistochemistry for high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63 was performed 
to confirm the cancer diagnosis. The AMACR staining intensity was graded as
negative, weak, moderate, and strong. Only the staining that was significantly
stronger than that of background benign glands was considered positive. A total
of 68% and 62% of foamy gland prostate cancer was positive for AMACR with P504S
and AMACR-p antibodies, respectively. A total of 77% and 70% of
pseudohyperplastic prostate cancer was positive for AMACR with P504S and AMACR-p 
antibodies, respectively. Staining was often heterogeneous with different
staining intensities within the same lesion. The mean percentage of stained
glands in positive cases was 74.4% (range 25-100%) with P504S and 78.9% (range
20-100%) with AMACR-p in foamy gland prostate cancer and 91% (range 10-100%) with
P504S, and 86.7% (range 10-100%) with AMACR-p in pseudohyperplastic prostate
cancer. Seven foci of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia present in
the study cases were all positive for AMACR. The two antibodies were not
statistically different in their sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion,
AMACR is potentially a useful diagnostic marker for foamy gland and
pseudohyperplastic prostate cancer in the following setting. When the pathologist
favors the diagnosis of these variants of cancer on routine stained sections and 
stains for basal cells are negative, yet still a definitive diagnosis of cancer
is difficult because of the cancers' deceptively benign appearance, positive
staining for AMACR can provide the additional confidence to establish a
definitive malignant diagnosis. The major caveat in the interpretation of
positive staining is that high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia cannot
be in the differential diagnosis.

Several ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, including Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal
dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) and Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Clefting (AEC) 
syndromes, are known to result from mutations in the p63 gene. We investigated
whether Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS) is also caused by mutations in the p63 gene. 
We identified a heterozygous de novo germline missense mutation, S545P, in the
sterile-alpha-motif (SAM) domain of p63, in a Thai patient affected with RHS.
This is the first genetic abnormality to be described in RHS. The amino acid
substitution is the most downstream missense mutation in p63 reported thus far.
Histological assessment of a skin biopsy from the patient's palm showed
hyperkeratosis and keratinocyte cell-cell detachment in the upper layers of the
epidermis, along with numerous apoptotic keratinocytes. Collectively, these
investigations demonstrate that RHS is also caused by mutations in p63 and that
the clinical similarities to AEC syndrome are paralleled by the nature of the
inherent mutation.

We studied the usefulness of p63 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)
immunostains for differentiating poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
(PDSCC) from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). We used monoclonal antibodies
reactive to p63 or TTF-1 to stain 4-microns-thick sections from 30
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung biopsy and resection specimens and 7
alcohol-fixed, formalin-postfixed, paraffin-embedded cell blocks from lung
fine-needle aspirations (FNAs). For p63, we used a streptavidin-biotin kit,
diaminobenzidine as the chromogen, and a hematoxylin counterstain. We used
automated immunostaining for TTF-1. The 37 cases included 23 SCLCs, 13 PDSCCs,
and 1 carcinoma initially diagnosed as PDSCC. All 23 SCLCs were negative or,
rarely, equivocal for p63; 20 (87%) of 23 were TTF-1+; nuclear staining ranged
from strong and/or frequent to weak and/or uncommon. All 13 PDSCCs were
TTF-1-/p63+ with intense staining of 50% to 100% of tumor cells. One case
originally diagnosed as PDSCC was TTF-1+/p63-, suggestive of SCLC; after
morphologic reexamination and immunostaining for neuroendocrine markers, it was
reclassified as intermediate-type SCLC. TTF-1 immunostaining showed equal or
increased sensitivity in alcohol-fixed cytologic cell block samples compared with
formalin-fixed biopsy material; in 1 SCLC case, the biopsy specimen was TTF-1-;
however, the FNA cell block stained positively. p63 and TTF-1 appear to be useful
for differentiating SCLC from lung PDSCC in formalin-fixed and alcohol-fixed,
formalin-postfixed material.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene integrates numerous signals to control cell life
and death. p53 and its function-related genes consists of a complicated gene
network. When a highly connected node in the network breaks down, the disruption 
of p53 has severe consequences. p53 gene locates in human chromosome 17q13.1. Its
encoding wild-type p53 protein is composed of four parts: N-terminal activation
domain, DNA-binding domain, oligomerization domain, and C-terminal regulation
domain. As the gene structures of p73, p51, p63 are similar with p53, they are
regarded as members of p53 gene family. p53 play an intermediate role connecting 
varied stress signals with the reactions of cells. DNA damage caused by ionizing 
radiation, aberrant growth signals, or chemotherapeutic drugs may activate the
p53 network. When expression of p53 elevated, p53-mdm2 and p14(ARF)-mdm2 feedback
loops can accurately regulate the expression level of p53, and the cooperation of
p33ING1b gene is also needed in the process of p53 exerting normal function.
Phosphorylation and acelylation are two important mechanisms to modulate p53
activity in vivo. Several dozen downstream genes are controlled directly by p53, 
and the activity of p53 falls into four categories: cell cycle inhibition,
apoptosis, genetic stability, and inhibition of blood vessel formation.
Elucidation of the function of p53 gene network will help to clarify the
interaction mechanisms of p53 gene and its function-related genes.

The p63 gene shows remarkable structural similarity to the p53 and p73 genes.
Because of two promoters, the p63 gene generates two types of protein isoforms,
TAp63 and DeltaNp63. Each type yields three isotypes (alpha, beta, gamma) because
of differential splicing of the p63 COOH terminus. The purpose of this study was 
to determine whether there is a functional link between the distinct p63 isotypes
in their transcriptional regulation of downstream targets and their role in
various cellular functions. TAp63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha adenovirus expression
vectors were introduced into Saos2 cells for 4 and 24 h, and then gene profiling 
was performed using a DNA microarray chip analysis. Seventy-four genes (>2-fold
change in expression) were identified that overlapped between two independent
studies. Thirty-five genes were selected for direct expression testing of which
27 were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR or Northern blot analysis. A
survey of these genes shows that p63 can regulate a wide range of downstream gene
targets with various cellular functions, including cell cycle control, stress,
and signal transduction. Our study thus revealed p63 transcriptional regulation
of many genes in cancer and development while often demonstrating opposing
regulatory functions for TAp63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha.

PURPOSE: Human corneal limbal stem cells mature and repopulate the superficial
layers of the cornea throughout life. In this study, we tested the hypothesis
that human corneal stem cells, derived from neural ectoderm, can exhibit
functional neuronal properties.
METHODS: Human corneal limbal tissue (donor age 6 weeks to 92 years) was obtained
from Upstate New York Transplant Services. Tissues were grown as explants on
coverslips in DMEM with 10% calf serum. After 7-14 days in vitro, tissues on
coverslips were double-immunostained for the stem cell marker, p63, along with
nestin and neurotransmitter receptors GABA, dopamine, serotonin, glycine or
acetylcholine. We also carried out whole cell current clamp and voltage clamp
recordings on corneal stem cell cultures in order to determine their functional
neurophysiological properties.
RESULTS: Co-localization of p63 with nestin, GABA receptor, glycine receptor, and
serotonin receptor immunoreactivity was seen in a small number of cells in the
corneal stem cell cultures. The resting potential of corneal stem cells was
relatively low, approximately -13+/-8 mV (n=13; range -6 mV to -40 mV) measured
in current clamp. No action potentials or voltage sensitive Na+ and K+ currents
were detected. However, in a small number of cells, kainic acid (0.5 mM), a
non-NMDA glutamate receptor agonist, and GABA induced a small inward current.
Glutamate receptor antagonist, CNQX, and GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline
and CGP-35348 blocked the agonist response.
CONCLUSIONS: A subpopulation of human corneal stem cells exhibit neuronal
properties in vitro, as evidenced by immunoreactivity to nestin, GABA receptor,
glycine receptor, and serotonin receptor, as well as functional
neurophysiological responses to GABA and kainic acid. Human corneal stem cells
may represent a potential source of non-embryonic, autologous,
surgically-accessible graft material with neuronal potential.

The functions of p107 and p130, members of the retinoblastoma family, include the
control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in several tissues. Our
previous studies suggested a role for p107 and p130 in keratinocyte
differentiation in vitro. We now extend these data using knockout animal models. 
We found impaired terminal differentiation in the interfollicular keratinocytes
of p107/p130-double-null mice epidermis. In addition, we observed a decreased
number of hair follicles and a clear developmental delay in hair, whiskers and
tooth germs. Skin grafts of p107/p130-deficient epidermis onto NOD/scid mice
showed altered differentiation and hyperproliferation of the interfollicular
keratinocytes, thus demonstrating that the absence of p107 and p130 results in
the deficient control of differentiation in keratinocytes in a cell-autonomous
manner. Besides normal hair formation, follicular cysts, misoriented and
dysplastic follicles, together with aberrant hair cycling, were also observed in 
the p107/p130 skin transplants. Finally, the hair abnormalities in p107/p130-null
skin were associated with altered Bmp4-dependent signaling including decreased
DeltaNp63 expression. These results indicate an essential role for p107 and p130 
in the epithelial-mesenchimal interactions.

p63, a p53 family member, is required for craniofacial and limb development as
well as proper skin differentiation. However, p63 mutations associated with the
ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC) syndrome (Hay-Wells syndrome)
were found in the p63 carboxyl-terminal region with a sterile alpha-motif. By
two-hybrid screen we identified several proteins that interact with the p63alpha 
carboxyl terminus and its sterile alpha-motif, including the apobec-1-binding
protein-1 (ABBP1). AEC-associated mutations completely abolished the physical
interaction between ABBP1 and p63alpha. Moreover the physical association of
p63alpha and ABBP1 led to a specific shift of FGFR-2 alternative splicing toward 
the K-SAM isoform essential for epithelial differentiation. We thus propose that 
a p63alpha-ABBP1 complex differentially regulates FGFR-2 expression by supporting
alternative splicing of the K-SAM isoform of FGFR-2. The inability of mutated
p63alpha to support this splicing likely leads to the inhibition of epithelial
differentiation and, in turn, accounts for the AEC phenotype.

Teeth are vertebrate organs that arise from complex and progressive interactions 
between an ectoderm, the oral epithelium and an underlying mesenchyme. During
their early development, tooth germs exhibit many morphological and molecular
similarities with other developing epithelial appendages, such as hair follicles,
mammary and salivary glands, lungs, kidneys, etc. The developing mouse tooth
germ, which is an experimentally accessible model for organogenesis, provides a
powerful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control the
development of these organs. Dentition patterning also provides a unique model
for understanding how different shapes of teeth arise in different regions of the
jaws. We review here the main signalling networks mediating the
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions involved in tooth morphogenesis and
patterning.

Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), also known as ectrodactyly, is a
congenital limb malformation, characterized by a deep median cleft of the hand
and/or foot due to the absence of the central rays. SHFM may occur as an isolated
entity or as part of a syndrome. Both forms are frequently found in association
with chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions or translocations. Detailed
studies of a number of mouse models for ectrodactyly have revealed that a failure
to maintain median apical ectodermal ridge (AER) signalling is the main
pathogenic mechanism. A number of factors complicate the identification of the
genetic defects underlying human ectrodactyly: the limited number of families
linked to each SHFM locus, the large number of morphogens involved in limb
development, the complex interactions between these morphogens, the involvement
of modifier genes, and the presumed involvement of multiple genes or long-range
regulatory elements in some cases of ectrodactyly. So far, the only mutations
known to underlie SHFM in humans have been found in the TP63 gene. The
identification of novel human and mouse mutations for ectrodactyly will enhance
our understanding of AER functions and the pathogenesis of ectrodactyly.

Superoxide production by phagocytes involves activation of a multi-component
NADPH oxidase. Recently, several homologues of the catalytic component of the
phagocyte oxidase, gp91phox, were identified in various tissues. Here we describe
two proteins, p41 and p51, with significant homology to two cytosolic components 
of the phagocytic oxidase, p47phox and p67phox. Like p47phox, p41 contains an
amino-terminal Phox homology domain, two SH3 domains, and a conserved
carboxyl-terminal, proline-rich motif. Similarly, p51 is homologous to p67phox,
containing four amino-terminal tetratrico-peptide repeats, a conserved
"activation domain" motif, a PB1 domain, and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. The 
highest levels of p41 transcript are detected in the colon and in other
gastrointestinal tissues that express Nox1, the predominant gp91phox homologue in
these tissues. In contrast, the p51 transcript showed a more widespread
expression pattern, suggesting that it may support other tissue-specific
oxidases. Mouse colon in situ hybridization detected both transcripts in the
epithelial cells of colon crypts. Heterologous co-expression of p41 and p51
significantly enhances the superoxide-generating activity of Nox1-expressing
cells; thus, p41 and p51 appear to be novel regulators of Nox1. These proteins
also support the activity of gp91phox, albeit at much lower levels than the
cytosolic phox counterparts. Our results suggest colon epithelial cells contain a
multi-component NAD(P)H oxidase with a molecular architecture similar to the
phagocytic oxidase.

CONTEXT: p63 is a recently described p53 homologue. Despite structural homology, 
they have different activities.
OBJECTIVES: To obtain new insights into the role of p63 in normal and neoplastic 
breast tissue and to verify the possible association between p63 and p53 in
breast carcinomas.
DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry in 85 breast carcinomas using p63, smooth muscle
actin (1A4), p53, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor. The p63-positive 
cases were submitted to a double-immunolabeling study using p63 with 1A4,
cytokeratin 7, and 34betaE12. Clinical data were retrieved from medical files.
RESULTS: p63, like 1A4, stained a single and continuous layer surrounding normal 
breast ductal and alveolar epithelium. In carcinomas, p53 was expressed in 21.17%
of carcinomas, whereas p63 was expressed only in poorly differentiated ductal
carcinomas (11.76% of cases). p63-positive cells coexpressed 1A4 and 34betaE12,
but not cytokeratin 7. Expression of p63 correlated with pathologic staging,
tumor size, histologic grading, nodal metastasis, and estrogen receptor
negativity.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 is a specific myoepithelial cell marker in normal breast tissue 
and is expressed in a minority of breast carcinomas, being seen only in grade III
ductal carcinomas. In ductal carcinomas, malignant p63-positive cells have an
immunophenotype similar to that of myoepithelial cells, suggesting that these
cells originate from a primary progenitor cell that underwent divergent
differentiation to ductal and myoepithelial cells during clonal expansion. Our
study argues against a direct role in mammary tumorigenesis. However, p53 is
rarely coexpressed with p63, suggesting that p63 could act indirectly as an
oncogene by inhibiting p53. This hypothesis could also explain why p63 correlated
with several other indicators of poor prognosis.

p63 is a recently identified homolog of p53 that is found in the basal layer of
several stratified epithelial tissues such as the epidermis, oral mucosa,
prostate, and urogenital tract. Studies with p63(-/-) mice and analysis of
several human autosomal-dominant disorders with germ line p63 mutations suggest
p63 involvement in maintaining epidermal stem cell populations. The p63 gene
encodes six splice variants with reported transactivating or dominant-negative
activities. The goals of the current study were to determine the splice variants 
that are expressed in primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) and the
biochemical activity p63 has in these epithelial cell populations. We found that 
the predominant splice variant expressed in HEKs was Delta Np63 alpha, and it was
present as a phosphorylated protein. During HEK differentiation, Delta Np63 alpha
and p53 levels decreased, while expression of p53 target genes p21 and 14-3-3
sigma increased. Delta Np63 alpha had transcriptional repressor activity in
vitro, and this activity was reduced in Delta Np63 alpha proteins containing
point mutations, corresponding to those found in patients with Hay-Wells
syndrome. Further, we show that Delta Np63 alpha and p53 can bind the p21 and
14-3-3 sigma promoters in vitro and in vivo, with decreased binding of p63 to
these promoters during HEK differentiation. These data suggest that Delta Np63
alpha acts as a transcriptional repressor at select growth regulatory gene
promoters in HEKs, and this repression likely plays an important role in the
proliferative capacity of basal keratinocytes.

Based on gene sequence homologies, a p53 (TP53) gene family become apparent with 
the addition of the most recently identified p63 (TP73L; formerly TP63) and p73
(TP73) genes to the already known p53. The p53 gene encodes for a unique protein 
eliciting well-known tumor suppressor gene (TSG) properties that mediate cellular
response to DNA damage, e.g., cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In contrast, both
homologues specify an array of isoforms different in their N- and C-terminal
domains. Transactivating isoforms, such as TAp63/p73, show TSG properties similar
to p53, while isoforms lacking N-terminal transactivating domain such as
DeltaNp63/p73, induce a functional block against p53 as well as TAp63/p73
activities. Both p63/p73 types of isoforms are involved in development: p63 is
critical for epithelial stem cell renewal and epithelial homeostasis, and p73 is 
involved in neurogenesis and natural immune response. These facts support
interdependent functions for the p53 family members, which appear linked together
in a complex and tight regulation network to fulfill cellular functions related
to DNA damage and tissue homeostasis maintenance. The lack of p63/p73 mutations
in human cancers rule out a typical TSG role for either of the p53 homologues.
Nonetheless, p63 and p73 genes seem strongly involved in malignancy acquisition
and maintenance process because of: 1) their tissue identities, and 2) their
close interplay activities within the p53 family members, and primarily through
the negative regulatory role played by DeltaNp63/p73 isoforms for cell death
control and differentiation.

p63, a homologue of the p53 gene, is considered to be essential for the normal
development of stratified epithelia including urothelium. To examine possible
roles of p63 in urothelial tumorigenesis, p63 expression was systematically
examined in normal urothelium, low-grade papillary noninvasive (LPN) urothelial
tumours, and high-grade or invasive carcinomas, using either an
isoform-nonspecific or a Delta N-isoform-specific antibody. Expression profiles
of p63 were also analysed in cultured cells. Immunoreactivity with the two
antibodies was virtually identical in tissue samples examined. Basal and
intermediate cell layers of normal urothelium showed intense nuclear p63
immunostaining. This normal staining pattern was preserved in a majority of LPN
tumours, whereas it was frequently impaired in high-grade or muscle-invasive
carcinomas. At the mRNA level, Delta Np63 expression predominated over TAp63, and
amounts of Delta Np63 mRNA correlated with p63 immunoreactivity, confirming that 
Delta Np63 accounts for p63 expressed in urothelial tissues. In cultured cells,
Delta Np63 was also expressed in low-grade tumour cells as well as normal
urothelial cells, but undetectable in high-grade aggressive carcinoma cells.
Interestingly, impaired Delta Np63 expression significantly associated with
reduced beta-catenin expression that was possibly related to progression of
urothelial neoplasms. Thus, impaired Delta Np63 expression characterises
aggressive phenotypes of urothelial neoplasms.

Metaplastic carcinomas of the breast (MCBs) are unusual neoplasms characterized
by an admixture of glandular epithelial components, which frequently exhibit
features of squamous differentiation, and mesenchymal malignant components.
Regardless of the presence of myoepithelial features in MCB, no consensus
concerning their putative histogenesis has yet been achieved. Recently, novel
putative myoepithelial markers have been developed, including p63, maspin, and
P-cadherin. We assessed the expression of these myoepithelial markers in MCBs and
compared their expression with classic myoepithelial markers.
Immunohistochemistry using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique
with antibodies raised against p63, maspin, P-cadherin, actin (clones CGA7, 1A4
and HHF35), cytokeratin 14 (Ck14), and vimentin was performed on 16 MCBs (7
matrix-producing MCBs, 6 adenosquamous MCBs, and 3 MCBs with heterologous
elements). In healthy breast lobules and ducts adjacent to the tumors,
myoepithelial cells showed distinctive and consistent immunoreactivity for p63,
maspin, P-cadherin, actin, S-100 protein, and Ck14. Matrix-producing MCBs were
positive for maspin in all cases, for p63 in 4 of 7 cases, and for P-cadherin in 
4 of 7 cases. Adenosquamous MCB showed immunoreactivity for p63, maspin, and
P-cadherin in 5 of 6 cases. All novel myoepithelial markers and Ck14 decorated
squamous cell islands. MCBs with heterologous elements were positive for p63 in 1
case, for maspin in all 3 cases, and for P-cadherin in 2 cases. All cases showed 
at least one of the novel myoepithelial markers. Eleven of 16 cases were positive
for actin. Eleven of 14 cases reacted with Ck14, and all cases that stained for
S-100 protein (9 of 9) and vimentin (13 of 13) were also positive. Based on our
findings, the balance of probabilities favors that MCBs may have a basal or
myoepithelial cell histogenesis and differentiation.

Basal cell cocktail (34betaE12 + p63) improves the detection of prostate basal
cells.

Antibodies against high molecular weight cytokeratin (34betaE12) and p63 are
frequently used basal cell markers to aid in the diagnosis of prostate cancer
(Pca). Absence of a basal cell marker in an atypical lesion histologically
suspicious for cancer supports a diagnosis of Pca. However, absence of basal
cells demonstrable by basal cell immunohistochemistry (IHC) is not always
conclusive for PCa. Some benign prostatic lesions may have inconspicuous or even 
lack basal cell lining focally. Technical factors such as tissue fixation and
antigen retrieval techniques may also make the detection of basal cells
difficult. Improving the sensitivity of current basal cell markers is critical if
these tests are being used to help make diagnostic decisions in conjunction with 
standard histology. In this study, we test the hypothesis that that inclusion of 
both 34betaE12 and p63 in the same IHC reaction (basal cell cocktail) is
advantageous over either marker used alone. One thousand three hundred fifty
glands from 9 trans-urethral resectioned of prostate specimens with benign
prostatic hypertrophy were used to study the immunostaining intensity and pattern
for 34betaE12, p63, and the basal cell cocktail. Basal cell marker expression was
scored as strong, moderate, weak, or negative. Basal cell staining was considered
complete if 75% of the gland's circumference was positive for the basal cell
marker and partial if <25% of the circumference was stained. The mean staining
intensity and variance were calculated for 34betaE12, p63, and the basal cell
cocktail. A paired test was used to evaluate whether the overall basal cell
staining was significantly different between 34betaE12, p63, and the basal cell
cocktail. F-test was used to assess the variances for 34betaE12, p63, and the
basal cell cocktail. A high-density tissue microarray (TMA) comprising prostate
tissue from 103 tumors from men with clinically localized Pca and a separate TMA 
comprising metastatic hormone-refractory Pca samples from 23 rapid autopsy cases 
were used to study the aberrant expression of 34betaE12 and p63 in clinically
localized and poorly differentiated Pca. The prostate glands in transition zone
have variable basal cell staining intensity and pattern with 34betaE12, p63, or
the cocktail. Histologically, benign glands lack basal cell lining in 2%, 6%, and
2% of glands with cocktail, 34betaE12, and p63 staining, respectively. The
staining variance for the cocktail is significantly smaller than that for
34betaE12 (0.0100 vs 0.1559, p = 0.0008). It is also smaller than that for p63,
although a statistical significance has not been reached (0.0100 vs 0.0345, p =
0.099). The basal cell cocktail stains the basal cell layers more intensely than 
either 34betaE12 or p63 alone, with complete and partial strong basal cell
staining in 93% and 1% of benign glands, compared with 55% and 4% with 34betaE12 
and 81% and 1% with p63. Complete and partial weak staining is seen in 0% and 0% 
of benign glands with basal cell cocktail, compared with 8% and 7% with 34betaE12
and 4% and 1% with p63 (p = 0.007 and 0.014 for cocktail vs 34betaE12 and
cocktail vs p63, respectively). A total of 2.8% clinically localized Pca had
positive 34betaE12 staining and 0.3% had positive p63 staining. Five (22%) of the
metastatic Pca is positive for 34betaE12. However, none had p63 expression. The
basal cell cocktail had a staining pattern identical to that of 34betaE12. IHC of
the prostatic glands from the transition zone is subjected to staining
variability that results in frequent variable and occasional negative basal cell 
staining in histologically benign glands; 34betaE12 is most susceptible, and
basal cell cocktail is least susceptible to such variability. Basal cell cocktail
not only increases the sensitivity of the basal cell detection, but also reduces 
the staining variability and therefore renders the basal cell immunostaining more
consistent. We recommend this basal cell cocktail for routine Pca diagnostic
work-up.

The p53 family includes three members that share significant sequence homology,
yet exhibit fundamentally different functions in tumorigenesis. Whereas p53
displays all characteristics of a classical tumor suppressor, its homologues p63 
and p73 do not. We have previously shown, that NH(2)-terminally truncated
isoforms of p73 (Delta TA-p73), which act as dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 
are frequently overexpressed in cancer cells. Here we provide evidence that Delta
TA-p73 isoforms also affect the retinoblastoma protein (RB) tumor suppressor
pathway independent of p53. Delta TA-p73 isoforms inactivate RB by increased
phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced E2F activity and proliferation of
fibroblasts. By inactivating the two major tumor suppressor pathways in human
cells they act functionally analogous to several viral oncoproteins. These
findings provide an explanation for the fundamentally different functions of p53 
and p73 in tumorigenesis.

p63 expression was evaluated in a tissue microarray of prostate tissues including
benign glands, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic carcinoma.
Immunostaining with anti-p63 antibody was restricted to basal cell nuclei.
Detectable p63 was found in immortalized and early passage cell cultures, but not
in senescent cultures or metastatic tumor-derived cell lines. The selective
presence of p63 in basal cells of the prostate suggests that p63 can be used as a
marker of basal cells and in vitro typing cell cultures of prostate cancer (CaP).
The basal cell association underscores its critical functions in the biology of
basal cells.

BACKGROUND: p63, a member of the p53 gene family, is expressed in basal cells of 
several different organs.
METHODS: The immunoreactivity of p63 was examined in normal human epidermis and
epidermal appendages and their tumors, and compared with proliferative activity
as evaluated by Ki-67.
RESULTS: In normal skin, p63 expression was seen in basal/suprabasal cells of the
epidermis, outer root sheath and hair matrix cells of the hair follicle,
seboblast situated in the outermost layer of sebaceous glands, and outer layer
cells of the ductal portion and myoepithelial cells of the secretory portion of
the sweat glands. p63 expression was confined to the cells forming a continuous
basal rim along the normal epithelial structure. In tumors, p63 expression
resembled that in normal tissue in that tumor components originating from
p63-positive cells were constantly positive for p63. In normal and tumor tissues,
not all p63-positive cells were positive for Ki-67.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 expression may be a marker of basal/progenitor cells in tumors
of epidermis and epidermal appendages, and may be a diagnostic marker of these
tumors.

p63 is essential for epithelial cell survival and may function as an oncogene. We
examined by immunohistochemistry p63 expression in human normal and tumor
salivary gland tissues. In normal salivary glands, p63 was expressed in the
nuclei of myoepithelial and basal duct cells. Among 68 representative salivary
gland tumors, 63 displayed p63 reactivity. In all tumor types differentiated
towards luminal and myoepithelial lineages (pleomorphic adenomas, basal cell
adenomas, adenoid cystic carcinomas, and epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas),
p63 was expressed in myoepithelial cells, whereas luminal cells were always
negative. Similarly, in mucoepidermoid carcinomas, basal, intermediate, and
squamous cells expressed p63, in contrast to luminal mucous cells. p63 reactivity
was also restricted to basal cells in Warthin tumors and oncocytomas.
Myoepitheliomas and myoepithelial carcinomas all expressed p63. The only five
negative tumors were three of four acinar cell carcinomas and two of three
adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, p63 is expressed in the nuclei of normal human
salivary gland myoepithelial and basal duct cells. p63 expression is retained in 
the modified myoepithelial and basal cells of human salivary gland tumors, which 
suggests a role for p63 in oncogenesis of these complex tumors.

p63 expression in solid cell nests of the thyroid: further evidence for a stem

Solid cell nests of the thyroid are embryonic remnants of endodermal origin that 
may be difficult to distinguish from squamous metaplasia, metastatic squamous
carcinoma, papillary microcarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, and C-cell hyperplasia.
These embryonic structures are composed of main cells and C-cells; cystic
structures and mixed follicles are sometimes observed intermingled with solid
cell nests. Recently, p63, a p53 homologue that is consistently expressed in
basal/stem cells of stratified epithelia and plays a major role in triggering the
differentiation of some specific cell lineages, has been characterized. We
evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of p63, cytokeratins (CAM 5.2,
AE1/AE3, 34betaE12, 7, and 20), carcinoembryonic antigen, thyroid transcription
factor 1 (TTF-1), thyroglobulin, and calcitonin using the
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique in 6 bona fide solid cell nests.
We observed that main cells of solid cell nests are strongly decorated by p63,
while C-cells and all other thyroid structures were consistently negative.
Moreover, main cells expressed carcinoembryonic antigen and all cytokeratins but 
cytokeratin 20 and lacked TTF-1, thyroglobulin and calcitonin. In contrast to
this, C-cells of solid cell nests were immunoreactive for calcitonin, CAM 5.2,
AE1/AE3, and cytokeratin 7; focal immunoreactivity for TTF-1 was also observed in
some C-cells. We conclude that main cells of the solid cell nests display a
basal/stem cell phenotype (p63 and basal cytokeratin positivity), whereas C-cells
show features of parafollicular differentiation. We conclude, furthermore, that
p63 antibodies may help in distinguishing solid cell nests from their mimics.

Identification of myoepithelial cells using antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins, 
such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMM-HC) and calponin, can play an
important role in distinguishing invasive carcinoma from its histologic mimics.
However, antibodies to these proteins may also cross-react with stromal
myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. It has recently been
demonstrated that myoepithelial cells express the nuclear protein, p63, a member 
of the p53 gene family. We compared the patterns of reactivity of antibodies with
p63, calponin, and SMM-HC on 85 breast lesions, including 11 cases of sclerosing 
adenosis, 33 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, including 10 that showed
microinvasion, 6 cases of lobular carcinoma in situ, and 35 cases of infiltrating
ductal carcinoma. All three antibodies were positive on the vast majority of
myoepithelial cells in all cases. A small minority of cases showed focal gaps in 
the revealed myoepithelial cell layer, reflected in discontinuous positive
immunostaining around noninvasive epithelial nests (including ductal carcinoma in
situ). No case showed p63 expression by myofibroblasts or vascular smooth muscle 
cells, whereas myofibroblasts expressed, in 8% and 76% of cases, SMM-HC and
calponin, respectively. Although no tumor cell reactivity was noted with
antibodies to calponin or SMM-HC, tumor cells in 11% of cases showed at least
focal p63 expression. And although antibodies to p63 offer excellent sensitivity 
and increased specificity for myoepithelial detection relative to antibodies to
calponin and SMM-HC, they have the following diagnostic limitations: 1) they
occasionally demonstrate an apparently discontinuous myoepithelial layer,
particularly around ductal carcinoma in situ, and 2) they react with a small but 
significant subset of breast carcinoma tumor cells. p63 may represent a
myoepithelial marker that can complement or replace SMM-HC and/or calponin in the
analysis of difficult breast lesions.

Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA, named for its strong sequence homology to the
thymocyte marker stem cell antigen 2) is a cell surface antigen expressed in
normal prostate and associated with human and murine prostate cancer. To begin to
investigate a possible link between PSCA expression in normal prostate and
prostate carcinogenesis, we characterized the phenotype and proliferative
behavior of normal PSCA-expressing prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) in tissue
culture. PSCA was expressed in a subset of prostate epithelial cells that
coexpress basal and secretory cytokeratins. PSCA-positive cells were the direct
progeny of PSCA-negative cells and were characterized by a more differentiated
morphology and a slower proliferative rate than PSCA-negative cells. Although
PSCA-positive cells continued to express basal cell markers such as CD44, they
lost expression of the basal cell marker p63. In contrast, expression of prostate
specific antigen and androgen receptor transcripts was detectable in
PSCA-positive PrEC. These findings suggest that PSCA is a unique marker of an
intermediate subpopulation of PrEC in transition from a basal to a terminally
differentiated secretory phenotype and may be a useful marker for the study of
normal and malignant prostate development.

Diagnostically reliable identification of prostatic basal cells has depended on
staining for high molecular weight cytokeratin. The diagnosis of malignancy is
often based on the absence of basal cells. False-negative staining is
occasionally observed. Thus, a second method of identifying basal cells might
prove useful. Selective expression of p63, a homologue of p53, has been
demonstrated in prostatic basal cells. We investigated the diagnostic utility of 
p63 staining in 70 consecutive specimens for which the differential diagnosis
included prostatic adenocarcinoma: 68 needle biopsies and 2 transurethral
resection blocks. High molecular weight cytokeratin staining was the gold
standard when material was available. A total of 61 specimens were diagnosed as
carcinoma, 4 as atrophy, 2 as high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 2
as unclassified collections of benign glands, and 1 as carcinoma versus
high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Sections mounted on charged
slides were used for p63 staining for 14 specimens. Sections previously
hematoxylin and eosin stained on uncharged slides were used for 56 specimens. In 
every case in which there was successful p63 staining (55 specimens), basal cells
in benign lesions were properly marked and other cell types were not stained.
Uninformative staining in the remaining 15 specimens was due to failure of tissue
adherence in 14 specimens in which sections were on uncharged slides and, in 1
specimen, to poor positive internal control staining of benign glands. Thus, p63 
staining was informative in 55 of 56 specimens (98%) for which there was material
for examination. No case with satisfactory p63 and high molecular weight staining
showed disagreement between the two stains. An additional group of 21
transurethral resection specimens was stained (p63 and high molecular weight
cytokeratin). There was less false-negative staining for p63 compared with the
case of high molecular weight cytokeratin. No false-positive staining was seen.
We conclude that p63 staining is at least as sensitive and specific for the
identification of basal cells in diagnostic prostate specimens as is high
molecular weight cytokeratin staining.

During the evolution of Metazoa, the mitochondrial genome has remained
practically unchanged as indicated by its small size and constant gene content in
each lineage, although several evolutionary processes have taken place. In
contrast, the nuclear genome of Metazoa has undergone dramatic changes, as is
demonstrated by some entire genomes completely sequenced so far. The expansion of
gene families and the appearance of new functions and new regulatory circuits are
among the most prominent features. Here, we report a description of the evolution
of the p53 gene family as an example of expansion of both genetic complexity and 
gene expression of the nuclear genome.

p63 Staining of myoepithelial cells in breast fine needle aspirates: a study of
its role in differentiating in situ from invasive ductal carcinomas of the
breast.

AIMS: One of the limitations of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the
breast is in distinguishing invasive carcinoma (IDC) from ductal carcinoma in
situ (DCIS). It has been proposed that the presence of myoepithelial cells
overlying epithelial malignant cell clusters suggests DCIS. However, the
recognition of myoepithelial cells in aspirates may be difficult. The aim of this
study was to investigate a new nuclear myoepithelial cell marker, p63, a p53
homologue nuclear transcription factor, in a series of breast FNABs in an attempt
to distinguish IDC from DCIS.
METHODS: Papanicolaou stained smears from eight cases of pure DCIS and 15 cases
of pure IDC with a histologically confirmed diagnosis were submitted to
immunocytochemical analysis using the antibody 4A4 against p63. Two pathologists 
evaluated the presence of p63 positive cells overlying malignant cell clusters
and admixed with malignant cells. The frequency of p63 positive cells in DCIS and
IDC was compared using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: p63 consistently stained the nuclei of myoepithelial cells, either
overlying malignant cell clusters and/or admixed with malignant cells. p63
positive myoepithelial cells were seen in all DCIS cases and in nine of the 15
cases of IDC (p = 0.0375). In eight cases (three DCIS and five IDC), scattered
p63+ epithelial malignant cells were seen.
CONCLUSIONS: Although p63 positive myoepithelial cells are found more frequently 
in DCIS cases, their presence cannot be used as a criterion to rule out invasion 
in breast FNABs because they are present in up to 60% of invasive cases.

We identified REDD1 as a novel transcriptional target of p53 induced following
DNA damage. During embryogenesis, REDD1 expression mirrors the tissue-specific
pattern of the p53 family member p63, and TP63 null embryos show virtually no
expression of REDD1, which is restored in mouse embryo fibroblasts following p63 
expression. In differentiating primary keratinocytes, TP63 and REDD1 expression
are coordinately downregulated, and ectopic expression of either gene inhibits in
vitro differentiation. REDD1 appears to function in the regulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS); we show that TP63 null fibroblasts have decreased ROS
levels and reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, which are both increased
following ectopic expression of either TP63 or REDD1. Thus, REDD1 encodes a
shared transcriptional target that implicates ROS in the p53-dependent DNA damage
response and in p63-mediated regulation of epithelial differentiation.

p63 is a recently identified homologue of the tumor suppressor gene TP53, which
encodes multiple isotypes with transactivating, death-inducing and
dominant-negative activities. p63 is expressed in basal cells of squamous
epithelia and many kinds of tumors. To explore the penetrance of p63 in
esophageal cancer, we analyzed p63 expression in squamous cell carcinomas,
adjacent dysplasia and histologically normal mucosa of the esophagus by
combination of immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that the DeltaNp63 mRNA was easily
detectable in all malignant and histologically normal tissues, whereas TAp63
presented extremely low or no expression. The p63 protein was highly expressed in
50 of 51 tumor tissues without significant difference in gender, age, stage and
grade. Ten of 11 dysplasia exhibited strong p63 staining in all abnormal cells.
Interestingly, p63 expression was observed in 96% (45/47) histologically normal
epithelia adjacent to the cancerous tissues but only in 47% (14/30) mucosa far
from tumors. Most of the epithelia far from tumors showed weaker staining than
that adjacent to the cancerous tissues. In all the histologically normal
epithelia with p63 expression, irrespective of the distance from the tumors,
immunohistochemical reaction was restricted to the basal and suprabasal cell
layers. Our data suggested that DeltaNp63 is the major isotype expressed in
epithelia and tumors of the esophagus. Elevated expression of p63 is probably an 
early event in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, which may play a significant 
role in the development of the disease.

p63 is a transcription factor structurally related to the p53 tumor suppressor.
The C-terminal region differs from p53's in that it contains a sterile alpha
motif (SAM) domain and is subject to multiple alternative splicings. The
N-terminal region is present in the transactivation (TA) and DeltaN
configurations, with the latter lacking the transcriptional activation domain 1. 
Single amino acid substitutions and frameshift mutations of p63 cause the human
ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia clefting (AEC) or ectrodactyly ectodermal
dysplasia and facial clefting (EEC) syndromes. We have systematically compared
the activities of the wild-type p63 isoforms and of the natural mutants in
activation and repression assays on three promoters modulated by p53. We found
that p63 proteins with an altered SAM domain or no SAM domain-the beta isoforms, 
the EEC frameshift mutant, and the missense AEC mutations-all showed a distinctly
higher level of activation of the MDM2 promoter and decreased repression on the
HSP70 promoter. Fusion of SAM to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain repressed a
heterologous promoter. A second activation domain, TA2, corresponding to exons 11
to 12, was uncovered by comparing the activation of DeltaN isoforms on natural
promoters and in GAL4 fusion systems. In colony formation assays, the AEC
mutants, but not the EEC frameshift, were consistently less efficient in
suppressing growth, in both the TA version and the DeltaN version, with respect
to their p63alpha counterparts. These data highlight the modularity of p63,
identifying the SAM domain as a dominant transcriptional repression module and
indicating that the AEC and EEC frameshift mutants are characterized by a
subversion of the p63 transcriptional potential.

The human genome is far smaller than originally estimated, and one explanation is
that alternative splicing creates greater proteomic complexity than a simple
count of open reading frames would suggest. The p53 homologue p63, for example,
is a tetrameric transcription factor implicated in epithelial development and
expressed as at least six isoforms with widely differing transactivation
potential. In particular, p63alpha isoforms contain a 27-kDa C-terminal region
that drastically reduces their activity and is of clear biological importance,
since patients with deletions in this C terminus have phenotypes very similar to 
patients with mutations in the DNA-binding domain. We have identified a novel
domain within this C terminus that is necessary and sufficient for
transcriptional inhibition and which acts by binding to a region in the
N-terminal transactivation domain of p63 homologous to the MDM2 binding site in
p53. Based on this mechanism, we provide a model that explains the
transactivation potential of homo- and heterotetramers composed of different p63 
isoforms and their effect on p53.

The p63 gene encodes at least six different proteins with homology to the tumour 
suppressor protein p53 and the related p53 family member p73. So far, there have 
been limited data concerning the expression patterns of individual p63 proteins, 
due to a lack of reagents that distinguish between the different isoforms. Three 
antibodies have been produced specifically directed against the two N-terminal
isoforms (TAp63 and DeltaNp63) and the C-terminal region of the p63alpha
proteins. TAp63 proteins are located suprabasally in stratified epithelia
compared with the N-terminal truncated forms, which are more abundantly expressed
in the basal cell layer, indicating a switch in expression of p63 isoforms during
normal cellular differentiation. Analysis of squamous cell carcinomas shows
DeltaNp63alpha to be the most widely expressed isoform, compatible with a role
for this protein in promoting neoplastic cell growth in these tissues. DeltaNp63 
protein expression is also restricted to basal cells in breast and prostate,
whilst TAp63 isoforms are more widely expressed in these tissues as well as in
tumours at these sites. TAp63, but not DeltaNp63 or p63alpha, is detected in
normal colon and in colon carcinoma. TAp63 proteins are also expressed in the
nuclei of a sub-population of lymphoid cells and in most malignant lymphomas,
whereas DeltaNp63 proteins are not expressed. Taken together, a hitherto
unrecognized regulation of p63 isoform expression in vivo has been uncovered,
with different p63 proteins expressed during differentiation and in different
cell types. The data indicate roles for specific p63 isoforms not only in
maintaining epithelial stem cell populations, but also in cellular
differentiation and neoplasia.

p63 is a known homologue of p53. In contrast to p53, however, p63 mutations are
rarely seen in tumours. There have been several reports that p63 plays a
regulatory role in the normal differentiation of cells, whereas its role in
tumour biology must still be elucidated. The main aim of this study was to
compare p63 and p53 expression in tissue microarrays of malignant melanomas and
to establish any prognostic significance. p63 expression was found in 2 out of 59
tumours, both pT4. The p63 index did not exceed 30%. p53 expression was found in 
27 out of 59 melanomas, with maximal expression in up to 80% of tumour cells.
There were no correlations observed between the two markers. Multivariate
analysis confirmed the prognostically independent role of p53. This study also
confirmed that tissue microarrays can be used effectively for evaluation of the
expression of certain tumour markers.

This paper presents a patient with the following malformations: split hand and
split foot on the left side, a hypoplastic fifth ray of the right hand and a
hypoplastic first ray of the right foot with a small cleft between the first and 
second ray; eye abnormalities which consist of a complete iris coloboma of the
left eye in an atypical position (cranio-temporal) and a coloboma of the choroid 
in the right eye; a glandular hypospadias and terato-zoospermia. Since split
hand/split foot can be caused by mutations in the p63 gene, mutation analysis of 
this gene was performed. However, sequencing analysis did not reveal a mutation. 
This malformation complex may represent a new syndrome.

Products of the p63 gene, a recently described member of the p53 family, are
constitutively expressed in the basal cells of human bronchi and bronchioli. The 
truncated isoforms of the p63 gene (deltaN-p63 proteins) counteract the apoptotic
and cell cycle inhibitory functions of p53 after DNA damage, and this property is
likely to be central in the cell renewal strategy of stratified epithelial
tissues. To investigate the dysfunctional repair processes that characterize
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP), we
immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of the transactivating and
dominant-negative isoforms of the p63 gene on 16 tissue samples obtained from
patients suffering from this disorder. In most IPF cases herein investigated,
epithelial cells expressing deltaN-p63 were observed at sites of abnormal
proliferation at the bronchiolo-alveolar junctions, characterized by epithelial
hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, bronchiolization, and abnormal p53 nuclear
accumulation. Similar features were not observed in normal lung and in samples
taken from other pulmonary diseases used as controls, including acute
interstitial pneumonia, idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia,
nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia. On
the basis of these findings, we can hypothesize a new model for UIP pathogenesis,
involving a deregulated development of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and
abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells at the bronchiolo-alveolar junction
after cell injury. In our view, the progressive loss of alveolar tissue and lung 
remodeling after injury in IPF/UIP is concomitantly produced by pneumocyte loss
and alveolar collapse on one hand and by progressive bronchiolar proliferation
and architectural distortion on the other.

p63 is a p53-related gene that encodes for multiple mRNA transcripts with
(TA-p63) or without (DeltaN-p63) transactivating properties on p53-responsive
genes. We evaluated for the first time the prevalence and clinical implications
of p63 immunoreactivity (IR) and mRNA expression in laryngeal squamous cell
carcinomas (LSCCs). Moreover, we also assessed the relationships between p63
expression and p53 gene status. p63 IR was detectable in the basal cell layers of
non-neoplastic epithelium and in the whole thickness of dysplastic epithelium.
All the 150 LSCCs analyzed were immunoreactive for p63, with 28 (18.7%) cases
showing p63 IR in </=50% of neoplastic cells. DeltaN-p63 mRNA transcripts were
detected in all the 23 tumors analyzed, whereas TA-p63 mRNA transcripts were
absent in 5 (21.7%) cases. p53 gene mutations were found in 24 (29.2%) of the 82 
cases analyzed and p53 IR was found in 58 (53.7%) of the 108 cases analyzed;
neither was associated with p63 IR. No significant association was found between 
p63 IR and patients' survival. Interestingly, down-regulation of TA-p63 mRNA
levels was more prevalent in patients with T3-T4 tumors and advanced clinical
stage. Although the risk of death for cancer was higher in these patients (40%
versus 16.6%), this difference did not reach statistical significance. Our
results suggest that abnormal expression of p63 may be involved in the early
phases of laryngeal tumorigenesis irrespective of p53 gene status and that TA-p63
mRNA down-regulation, but not p63 IR, may be clinically relevant in patients with
LSCC.

p63 is a p53-homologous nuclear protein that appears to play a crucial role in
regulation of stem cell commitment in squamous and other epithelia. In this
study, p63 expression was examined in benign lung and in neoplasms of pulmonary
origin. Eighty sections from routinely fixed and processed archival bronchoscopic
biopsy or lobectomy specimens were pretreated with citric acid (pH 6.0) for
antigen retrieval, then incubated overnight with anti-p63 monoclonal antibody
4A4. Slides were stained using a streptavidin-biotin kit and diaminobenzidine as 
chromagen, and were counterstained with hematoxylin. In normal lung, p63
intensely stained nuclei of bronchial reserve cells but did not stain ciliated
cells, alveolar epithelial cells, or nonepithelial cells. The lower strata of
squamous metaplastic bronchial epithelium stained positively. All squamous-cell
carcinomas stained positively (n = 30). In some well-differentiated carcinomas,
staining was found at the periphery of tumor nests but was negative in central
zones showing squamous maturation. Poorly differentiated carcinomas showed very
high proportions (80% to 100%) of p63-positive nuclei. All small-cell carcinomas 
were p63 negative (n = 9). Staining of bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (n = 7) and 
adenocarcinomas (n = 23) was variable: some tumors showed no detectable staining,
others showed heterogeneously positive staining. Adenosquamous carcinomas (n = 5)
displayed a unique basalar staining pattern. Carcinoid tumors were almost
entirely negative (n = 5). We conclude that p63 is expressed in benign bronchial 
stem cells, in neoplastic cells with either squamous differentiation or squamous 
differentiating potential, and in a subpopulation of adenocarcinomas. p63
immunostaining may also aid in some histopathologic distinctions, such as in
small biopsies where the differential diagnosis is poorly differentiated squamous
carcinoma versus small-cell carcinoma. A stem cell biology-based classification
system for squamous carcinomas is proposed.

The p53 homolog p63 is a transcriptional activator. Here, we describe the
identification of an HMG1-like protein SSRP1 as a co-activator of p63. Over
expression of wild-type, but not deletion mutant, SSRP1 remarkably enhanced
p63gamma-dependent luciferase activity, G1 arrest, apoptosis and expression of
endogenous PIG3, p21(Waf1/cip1) and MDM2 in human p53-deficient lung carcinoma
H1299 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Also, SSRP1 interacted to p63gamma
in vitro and in cells, and resided with p63gamma at the p53-responsive DNA
element sites of the cellular endogenous MDM2 and p21(Waf1/cip1) promoters.
Moreover, N-terminus-deleted p63 (DeltaN-p63) bound to neither SSRP1 nor its
central domain in vitro. Accordingly, SSRP1 was unable to stimulate
DeltaN-p63-mediated residual luciferase activity and apoptosis in cells. Finally,
the ectopic expression of the central p63-binding domain of SSRP1 inhibited
p63-dependent transcription in cells. Thus, these results suggest that SSRP1
stimulates p63 activity by associating with this activator at the promoter.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis via the upregulation of downstream target genes. Ferredoxin 
Reductase (protein, FR; gene, FDXR) transfers electron from NADPH to cytochrome
P450 via ferredoxin in mitochondria. Here, we identified FDXR as a target gene of
the p53 family, that is, p53, p63, and p73. We found that FDXR can be induced by 
DNA damage in cells in a p53-dependent manner and by a mutated form of p53 that
is competent in inducing apoptosis. In addition, we identified a p53 response
element located within the FDXR promoter that is responsive to wild-type p53,
p63alpha, p63gamma, p73alpha, and p73beta. Furthermore, we showed that p53,
p63alpha and p73alpha directly bind to the p53 response element in vivo and
promote the accessibility of the FDXR promoter by increasing the acetylation of
histones H3 and H4. To determine the role of FR in p53 tumor suppression, we
generated cell lines that express FR using a tetracycline-regulated promoter. We 
found that over-expression of FR in lung H1299, breast MCF7, and colorectal
HCT116 carcinoma cells have no effect on cell proliferation. However, we showed
that FR increases the sensibility of H1299 and HCT116 cells to 5-fluorouracil-,
doxorubicin- and H(2)O(2)- mediated apoptosis. Our data support a model of
feed-forward loop for p53 activity, that is, various cellular stresses, including
reactive oxygen species (ROS), activate p53, which induces the expression of
FDXR; and the FDXR gene product, FR, in turn sensitizes cells to ROS-mediated
apoptosis.

p63, a member of the p53 gene family, encodes multiple proteins that may either
transactivate p53 responsive genes (TAp63) or act as a dominant-negative factor
toward p53 and p73 (Delta Np63). p63 is expressed in many epithelial compartments
and p63(-/-) mice fail to develop skin, prostate, and mammary glands among other 
defects. It has been previously shown that p63 is expressed in normal urothelium.
This study reports that p63 is regulated in bladder carcinogenesis and that p63
expression is lost in most invasive cancers whereas papillary superficial tumors 
maintain p63 expression. Examination of bladder carcinoma cell lines reveals that
certain lines derived from invasive carcinomas maintain expression of Delta Np63,
as demonstrated by both immunoblotting and confirmed by isoform-specific
quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Another novel
finding reported in this study is the fact that p63(-/-) mice develop a bladder
mucosa epithelial layer yet fail to complete uroepithelial differentiation,
producing a nontransitional default cuboidal epithelium. These data indicate that
in contrast to the skin and prostate, p63 is not required for formation of a
bladder epithelium but is indispensable for the specific differentiation of a
transitional urothelium.

BACKGROUND: p63 is a p53 homologue that is mapped to chromosome 3q27. This gene
encodes six different isoforms, which have either transactivating or dominant
negative effects on p53-reporter genes. It has been described that in contrast to
p53, p63 seems not to be associated with tumor predisposition, as neither p63
knockout mouse models nor germline p63 mutations are related to an increased risk
of tumorigenesis. It has been demonstrated that p63 is a reliable keratinocyte
stem cell marker and that it is involved in the maintenance of the stem cell
population. Scant data on p63 expression in normal skin, basal cell carcinomas
(BCCs), keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) have been reported. 
We herein evaluated p63 expression in 16 BCCs, one keratoacanthoma and 13 SCCs.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry according to the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase
technique, using the antibody 4A4 raised against all p63 isoforms, was performed.
p63 expression was evaluated in epidermal cells and skin appendages.
Semi-quantitative evaluation (-, +, ++, +++) of p63 expression in BCCs,
keratoacanthoma and SCCs was carried out. Only nuclear expression was considered 
as specific.
RESULTS: p63 was expressed in the nuclei of epidermal basal and suprabasal cells,
in the cells of the germinative hair matrix and the external root sheath of hair 
follicles, in the basal cells of the sebaceous gland and in the
myoepithelial/basal cells of the sweat glands. All terminally differentiated
cells were negative for p63. All BCCs showed ++ to +++ immunoreactivity. At
variance, keratoacanthomas and grade I and II SCCs showed variable p63 reactivity
in a basal layer-like distribution, whereas undifferentiated cells of grade III
SCCs showed ++ to +++ positivity. A grade IV spindle SCC showed +
immunoreactivity. The SCCs in situ showed remarkable expression of p63 in all
cell layers. Terminally differentiated squamous cells were either negative or
showed only focal immunoreactivity in the carcinomas.
CONCLUSIONS: p63 is consistently expressed in the basal cells of epidermis and
cutaneous appendages, including the basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands.
Based on our findings, the balance of probabilities favors that p63 might play a 
role in the pattern of differentiation and in the oncogenesis of usual carcinomas
of the skin.

The P63 gene is a recently discovered member of the p53 family. While P53 is
ubiquitously expressed, p63 is expressed specifically in embryonic ectoderm and
in the basal regenerative layers of epithelial tissues in the adult. Complete
abrogation of P63 gene function in an animal model points to the relevance of P63
for the proper development of ectodermally derived tissues. The p63 knockout
mouse dies at birth and has truncation of the limbs, as well as absence of
epidermis, prostate, breast, and urothelial tissues, apparently reflecting
ectodermal stem cell loss. A number of dominant human syndromes have been mapped 
to chromosome 3q27 and ultimately to mutations in the p63 gene. These syndromes
have abnormal limb development and/or ectodermal dysplasia and include
ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting syndrome; ankyloblepharon,
ectodermal dysplasia, clefting syndrome; acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth
syndrome; limb-mammary syndrome; as well as nonsyndromic split hand/foot
malformation. The pattern of heterozygous mutations is distinct for each of these
syndromes. Consistent with this syndrome-specific mutational pattern, the
functional consequences of mutations on the p63 proteins also vary, invoking
dominant-negative and gain-of-function mechanisms rather than a simple loss of
function.

P63 expression in papillary and anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid gland: lack 
of an oncogenetic role in tumorigenesis and progression.

P53 is considered one of the most important tumor suppressor genes and is mutated
in up to 50% of all neoplasms. Well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTCs)
only infrequently harbor p53 mutations. In contrast, these genetic alterations
have been described in approximately 85% of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas and are
considered a fundamental event in the malignant progression of WDTCs. However,
alternative mechanisms to overcome p53 tumor suppressing properties in WDTCs and 
anaplastic carcinomas (ACs) have not been clarified to date. p63, a
p53-homologue, has been recently characterized. In contrast to p53, p63 gene
encodes six isoforms, three with transactivating and three with dominant negative
(deltaN-p63) activities on p53 reporter genes. We hypothesized that
overexpression of deltaN-p63 isoforms might constitute an alternative mechanism
to overcome p53 tumor suppressing properties in WDTCs and ACs lacking p53
alterations. We semiquantitatively evaluated p53 and p63 immunoexpression in 12
papillary carcinomas (PC) and 11 anaplastic carcinomas. Only nuclear expression
was considered specific. All PCs lacked p53 expression; at variance, nine ACs
showed p53 immunoreactivity (+: 1 case; ++: 6 cases; +++: 2 cases). In PCs, p63
expression was restricted to scattered neoplastic cells juxtaposed to the
basement membrane of papillary projections and to foci of squamous metaplasia. In
ACs, p63 expression was observed in three cases, one of which lacked concurrent
p53 immunoexpression. Our results do not support the hypothesis that p63 might
constitute an alternative mechanism to overcome p53 tumor suppressing properties 
in thyroid neoplasms.

PURPOSE AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To detect surgically resectable tumors earlier
and improve the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients, we
examined deltaNp63 expression that was specific for squamous cell carcinoma in
blood samples obtained from 43 esophageal cancer patients.
RESULTS: Seventeen of 33 (52%) patients with primary esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma and 6 of 10 (60%) patients with postoperative recurrent squamous cell
carcinoma had detectable deltaNp63 expression in their peripheral blood using
deltaNp63-specific reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, deltaNp63 is a more
sensitive marker compared with other commonly used tumor markers such as squamous
cell carcinoma-associated antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach would be potentially useful for the monitoring of
patients with this aggressive disease.

The basal cell-specific cytokeratin antibody (34betaE12) is widely used to aid in
the diagnosis of cancer in challenging prostate needle biopsies (NBX) and
transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP). Because prostate carcinoma (PCa)
lacks basal cells, the absence of basal cell as determined by 34betaE12 can aid
in the confirmation of a histologically suspicious lesion. However,
false-negative staining occurs because of patchy cytoplasmic staining, making a
definitive diagnosis difficult. A recently identified basal cell marker p63, a
p53 homologue, stains basal cell nuclei but not secretory cells. The aim of this 
study is to determine if the p63 antibody offers any clinically useful advantage 
over 34betaE12 in the diagnosis of challenging atypical prostate lesions.
Ninety-four cases, comprised of 25 consecutive prostate NBX and 2 TURP with an
atypical suspicious focus, 55 NBX cases of histologically unequivocal PCa and 12 
TURP specimen removed for benign prostate hyperplasia, were stained with the
monoclonal antibodies 34betaE12 and 4A4 anti-p63. Basal cell staining intensity, 
percentage basal cell-positive glands in benign, malignant, and atypical foci,
and number of benign glands not staining were evaluated for 34betaE12 and p63
stains. A total of 67 prostate NBX cases, including one TURP, were diagnosed with
PCa, 1 atypical small acinar proliferation, 10 benign, and 4 cases excluded
because of lost tissue on step sections. None of the 67 PCa NBX cases
demonstrated 34betaE12 or p63 immunoreactivity (100% specific). Whereas 57 of 108
(53%) prostate NBX cores from 78 cases demonstrated a similar percentage of basal
cell staining for both antibodies, 45 of 108 (41%) NBX cores demonstrated a
higher percentage of p63 basal cell staining in benign glands. Only 6 of 108 NBX 
(6%) cores had a higher percentage of basal cell staining with 34betaE12
(Wilcoxon signed rank test, p <0.0001). Lack of basal cell staining in more than 
two benign glands occurred in 25 of 108 (23%) and 10 of 108 (9%) prostate NBX
cores stained with 34betaE12 and p63, respectively. In the vast majority of
atypical cases, both 34betaE12 and p63 staining differences were not clinically
significant, except in 2 of 27 (7%) cases p63 offered diagnostic utility beyond
the 34betaE12 immunostain. p63 in these cases demonstrated discontinuous but
strong staining in atypical glands and adjacent benign glands, whereas 34betaE12 
failed to stain optimally in this critical area. For 12 TURP cases the mean
percentage basal cell positivity in benign glands was 75% and 95% for 34betaE12
and p63, respectively (p = 0.006). Lack of basal cell staining in more than two
glands occurred in 12 of 12 (100%) and 2 of 12 (17%) TURP specimens stained with 
34betaE12 and p63, respectively (p <0.0001). In summary, 34betaE12 and p63 are
highly specific for basal cells and therefore are negative in areas of PCa. p63
is more sensitive than 34betaE12 in staining benign basal cells, particularly for
TURP specimens, offering slight advantage over 34betaE12 in diagnostically
challenging cases. p63 may be used as an alternative to 34betaE12 stain for
difficult prostate lesions.

The p63 protein, a member of the p53 family of nuclear transcription factors, is 
characterized by different capabilities of transactivating reporter genes,
inducing apoptosis, and functioning as dominant-negative agent. This study
evaluated the prevalence and prognostic implications of p63 immunoreactivity in
221 patients with stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and in 57
patients with stage I-IV neuroendocrine tumours (NET). The results were
correlated with the tumour proliferative fraction, the accumulation of p53
protein, and with patient survival. p63 immunoreactivity was seen in 109/118
squamous cell carcinomas, 15/95 adenocarcinomas, 2/2 adenosquamous carcinomas,
4/6 large cell carcinomas, 9/20 poorly differentiated NET, and 1/37 typical and
atypical carcinoids (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the prevalence of
p63-immunoreactive cells increased progressively from pre-neoplastic and
pre-invasive lesions to invasive squamous cell carcinomas. In these latter
tumours, but not in adenocarcinomas, p63 immunoreactivity correlated directly
with the tumour proliferative fraction (p = 0.028), and inversely with the tumour
grade (p = 0.004). No relationship was found with p53 protein immunoreactivity or
the other clinico-pathological variables examined. Although p63 is likely to be
involved in the development of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma, it does not
carry any prognostic implication for NSCLC patients.

The presence of naked nuclei (NN) in cytological preparations of fibroadenomas is
a well-known finding. Regardless of their importance on the differential
diagnosis of fibroadenoma and other benign lesions of the breast, the origin of
NN remains elusive. Despite previous efforts to characterize them, the lack of a 
reliable nuclear marker for myoepithelial cells impaired definitive conclusions. 
We performed a systematic evaluation of p63 expression in cytological and
histological preparations of 10 fibroadenoma specimens. We observed that in
histological sections, p63 was restricted to the nuclei of myoepithelial/basal
cells in lobules and ducts of normal breast. In fibroadenomas, p63 decorated the 
nuclei of myoepithelial cells in the periphery of epithelial duct-like formations
and slit-like formations. No p63 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal or
epithelial cells. In cytological samples, almost all NN and cells surrounding
epithelial cell clusters were stained; no stromal cell admixed with fibrillary
matrix or epithelial cell was stained with p63. Based on our findings, we
strongly suggest that most, if not all, NN are myoepithelial in origin.

p63 is a recently characterized p53-homolog that is consistently expressed by
basal/somatic stem cells of stratified epithelia, myoepithelial cells of the
breast and salivary glands, and proliferative compartment of gastric mucosa. p63 
is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q27) and it encodes six isoforms,
three transactivating (TA) and three DeltaN-isoforms. While the first three
isoforms may act as tumor suppressor genes, the DeltaN-isoforms may inhibit the
p53/TA-p63-driven cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recently, the putative
applications of p63 in the identification of myoepithelial cells of the breast
and basal cells of the prostate acini have been evaluated; however, no critical
systematic analysis of its role in surgical pathology practice have hitherto been
reported. We review the putative roles of p63 in surgical pathology practice and 
provide guidelines for future directions on p63 translational research.

The p53 tumor suppressor acts as a transcription factor and has a central
function in controlling apoptosis. With p63 and p73 two genes coding for proteins
homologous to p53 have been identified. We describe the properties of seven human
p63 and p73 proteins as transcriptional activators of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and
apoptotic inducers in direct comparison to p53 in the same assay systems
employing DLD-1-tet-off colon cells. Programmed cell death is detected in cells
expressing high levels of p53 and p73alpha. Cells overexpressing TAp63alpha,
TAp63gamma, TA*p63alpha, TA*p63gamma, DeltaNp63alpha, and DeltaNp63gamma display 
low or no detectable apoptosis.

EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with the cardinal signs of
ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and orofacial clefts. EEC syndrome has been
linked to chromosome 3q27 and heterozygous p63 mutations were detected in
unrelated EEC families. In addition, homozygous p63 null mice exhibit
craniofacial abnormalities, limb truncations, and absence of epidermal
appendages, such as hair follicles and tooth primordia. In this study, we
screened 39 syndromic patients, including four with EEC syndrome, five with
syndromes closely related to EEC syndrome, and 30 with other syndromic orofacial 
clefts and/or limb anomalies. We identified heterozygous p63 mutations in three
unrelated cases of EEC syndrome, two Iowa white families and one sporadic case in
a Filipino boy. One family is atypical for EEC and has features consistent with
Hay-Wells syndrome. In this family, the mutation ablates a splice acceptor site
and, in the other two, mutations produce amino acid substitutions, R280C and
R304Q, which alter conserved DNA binding sites. Germline mosaicism was detected
in the founder of the mutation in one case. These three cases show significant
interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in expressivity. We also screened p63
in 62 patients with non-syndromic orofacial clefts, identifying an intronic
single nucleotide polymorphism but finding no evidence of mutations that would
explain even a subset of non-syndromic orofacial clefts. This study supports a
common role for p63 in classical EEC syndrome, both familial and sporadic, but
not in other related or non-syndromic forms of orofacial clefts.

Chronic ulcerative stomatitis protein (CUSP), the most abundant cutaneous isoform
of p63, is a p53-related gene essential for epithelial development. CUSP lacks
the N-terminal transactivation domain found on other p53 family members and has
been shown to inhibit p53 function in vitro. In this study, biopsies of normal
skin (21 of 21), benign neoplasms [seborrheic keratosis (3 of 3), acrochordon (2 
of 3), and verruca plana (3 of 3)], and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (4 of 4)
displayed strong nuclear CUSP immuno-reactivity in epidermal cells. In contrast
few basal cell carcinomas (BCC) (7 of 27) and sebaceous nevi (1 of 2) displayed
this pattern of CUSP immunoreactivity. Thus, biopsies of cutaneous conditions
characterized by sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway dysregulation were more than 86
times as likely to lack CUSP/p63 immunofluorescence as were other cutaneous
samples. Adjacent normal-appearing skin from patients with basal cell nevus
syndrome (BCNS) (2 of 3) also lacked CUSP immuno-staining. Lastly, a BCC arising 
in a patched heterozygous mouse also lacked CUSP immuno-staining. Because CUSP
mRNA and protein were detected via Northern and Western analysis in BCC samples
lacking CUSP immuno-staining, we sequenced the coding region of CUSP from two
non-staining BCCs but found no mutations. Therefore, CUSP appears to be present, 
unmutated, and yet frequently undetectable by immunofluorescence in cutaneous
lesions in both humans and mice that are associated with SHH pathway
dysregulation (BCCs, BCNS, and nevus sebaceous).

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to analyze p63 and 14-3-3sigma expression in normal and
hyperdifferentiated head and neck mucosa.
STUDY DESIGN: Compare the in vivo expression of p63 and 14-3-3sigma by
immunohistochemistry in normal mucosa and oral lichen planus, a benign mucosal
lesion marked by hyperdifferentiation and apoptosis.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: p63 is underexpressed and 14-3-3sigma is overexpressed in
lichen planus on immunohistochemical analysis.
SIGNIFICANCE: The findings support the hypothesis that p63 plays an
antidifferentiation role, whereas 14-3-3sigma plays a prodifferentiation role in 
the upper aerodigestive tract epithelium. Lichen planus is a valuable model for
the study of p63, 14-3-3sigma, and mucosal differentiation. p63 and 14-3-3sigma
may be molecular markers for oral lichen planus.

The P53 homolog p63 encodes multiple proteins with transactivating,
apoptosis-inducing, and oncogenic activities. We showed that p63 is amplified and
that DeltaNp63 isotypes are overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and
enhance oncogenic growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, p53 associated with
DeltaNp63alpha and mediated its degradation. Here, we report that DeltaNp63
associates with the B56alpha regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 
and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), leading to a dramatic inhibition
of PP2A-mediated GSK3beta reactivation. The inhibitory effect of DeltaNp63 on
GSK3beta mediates a decrease in phosphorylation levels of beta-catenin, which
induces intranuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activates
beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Our results suggest that DeltaNp63 isotypes
act as positive regulators of the beta-catenin signaling pathway, providing a
basis for their oncogenic properties.

Several autosomal dominantly inherited human syndromes have recently been shown
to result from mutations in the p63 gene. These syndromes have various
combinations of limb malformations fitting the split hand-split foot spectrum,
orofacial clefting, and ectodermal dysplasia. The p63 syndrome family includes
the EEC syndrome, AEC syndrome, ADULT syndrome, limb-mammary syndrome, and
non-syndromic split hand/foot malformation. The pattern of heterozygous mutations
is distinct for each of these syndromes. The functional effects on the p63
proteins also vary between syndromes. In all of these syndromes, the mutation
appears to have both dominant negative and gain of function effects rather than
causing a simple loss of function.

Causative TP63 mutations have been identified in five distinct human
developmental disorders that are characterized by various degrees of limb
abnormalities, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. The distribution of
mutations over the various p63 protein domains and the structural and functional 
implications of these mutations establish a clear genotype-phenotype correlation.

p53 gene family p51(p63)-encoded, secondary transactivator p51B(TAp63alpha)
occurs without forming an immunoprecipitable complex with MDM2, but responds to
genotoxic stress by accumulation.

p51(p63), a member of the p53 tumor suppressor gene family, generates multiple
isoforms, including the potent and less potent transactivators p51A(TAp63gamma)
and p51B(TAp63alpha), respectively, the latter poorly characterized for its
protein features and functions. When constitutively expressed in 1-2-3 mouse
erythroleukemic cells, p51B(TAp63alpha) appeared as a broad band with an
approximate molecular mass of 85 kDa in Western blot. When cells were exposed to 
genotoxic stress by UV-C irradiation or by DNA-damaging drugs, including
actinomycin D, bleomycin, and eptoposide, the protein accumulated intracellularly
without an increase in its mRNA. Unlike p53 and p51A(TAp63gamma), however,
p51B(TAp63alpha) did not activate p21(waf1) gene expression, nor did it induce
apoptosis or hemoglobin production. While wild-type p53 was precipitated by an
anti-MDM2 antibody, p51B(TAp63alpha) was not detectable in the MDM2
immunoprecipitates from the producer cells. After treatment with okadaic acid, a 
Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor, p51B(TAp63alpha) increased its apparent molecular 
mass and protein content. A 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132
(N-CBZ-Leu-Leu-leu-al), also increased p51B(TAp63alpha) retention in an either
transient or constitutive expression system. Without an interaction with MDM2,
p51B(TAp63alpha) may be degraded by proteasome under normal cellular
circumstances but stabilized under genotoxic stress by a posttranscriptional
mechanism which might involve Ser/Thr phosphorylation.

As the antimitotic agent vincristine (VCR) has been reported to induce a weak p53
response in some studies, we hypothesised that p73 and p63, the recently
described p53 homologues, may replace p53 in triggering apoptosis or cell cycle
arrest effectors in VCR-treated cell lines. To address this issue, we measured
p53, p73 and p63 mRNA and protein levels in two VCR-treated breast cancer cell
lines, one p53-proficient (MCF7) and the other p53-deficient (MDA-MB157). We
found an increase of p53 mRNA and protein levels in VCR-treated MCF7 cells,
while, as expected, no p53 protein was detected in VCR-treated MDA-MB157 cells.
Surprisingly, the p73 mRNA and protein expression levels decreased in both cell
lines during VCR treatment, whereas p63 protein levels remained unchanged. In
both cell lines, up-regulations of the canonical p53-target genes, such as p21
and GADD45, were consistently observed. We conclude that, in response to VCR
treatment: (1) p53 is markedly induced in MCF7 cells, with the same extent than
after DNA damaging drugs treatments; and (2) p63 is not involved, while p73
expression is down-regulated regardless of the p53 status of the cell lines. Our 
results therefore suggest the involvement of a fourth member of the p53 gene
family, or the use of another pathway able to trigger canonical p53-target genes 
in response to VCR in p53-deficient cells.

TAp63gamma (p51A) and dNp63alpha (p73L), two major isoforms of the p63 gene,

Tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to repress expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen and a key mediator of 
tumor angiogenesis. The p63 gene, recently identified as a p53-relative, encodes 
multiple isoforms with structural and functional similarities and differences
from p53. In this study, we show the evidence that the two major isoforms of the 
p63 gene, TAp63gamma (p51A) and dNp63alpha (p73L), represses and upregulates VEGF
expression, respectively, on transcription and protein levels. Transient
transfection assays show that a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 binding site
within the VEGF promoter region is responsible for both upregulation and
repression by dNp63alpha and by TAp63gamma, respectively, of the VEGF promoter
activity. We also show that TAp63gamma targets HIF1alpha for promoting
proteasomal degradation but that dNp63alpha targets HIF1alpha for stabilization. 
Mammalian two-hybrid assays show that HIF1alpha-dependent transcription is
repressed by TAp63gamma as well as by p53, whereas it is upregulated by
dNp63alpha in collaboration with a transcription coactivator p300. Our data also 
show that dNp63alpha acts as a dominant-negative reagent toward both p53- and
TAp63gamma-mediated degradation of HIF1alpha and repression of
HIF1alpha-dependent transcription. These results suggest that p63 is involved in 
the regulation of the VEGF gene expression and that modulation of VEGF expression
by TAp63gamma and dNp63alpha is closely correlated with their distinct roles on
the regulation of HIF1alpha stability.

p73 and p63 are recently cloned genes that share considerable structural and
functional homologies with the p53 tumor suppressor gene. These genes, unlike
p53, express multiple mRNA isoforms with variable biologic functions, and their
suppressor nature has yet to be confirmed. To determine the interrelationship
between these genes in the tumorigenesis of head and neck squamous carcinoma
(HNSC), we performed immunohistochemical analyses of their protein products and
compared the data with clinicopathologic parameters in 38 patients. In
histologically normal epithelium, p53 and p73 showed similar basal and/or
parabasal expression, but that of p53 was weaker and discontinuous. p63 staining 
was noted in more suprabasal cellular layers and was stronger. In dysplasias, all
three markers manifested variable but gradual increase in extent and intensity of
cellular expression with histologic progression. In carcinomas, p63 was the most 
frequently expressed (94.7%), followed by p73 (68.4%) and p53 (52.6%).
Significant statistical correlation was noted only between p63 and p73
expressions (P =.04). Although no statistical correlation was found between p53
and p63 or p73, p53-negative tumors overexpressed either p63 or p73. p73
expression was associated with distant metastasis and perineural/vascular
invasion. Our study indicates that (1) p63 and p73 expression may represent an
early event in HNSC tumorigenesis, (2) the lack of correlation between p73 or p63
and p53 expression suggests an independent and/or compensatory functional role,
(3) p73 expression may play a part in HNSC progression, and (4) p73 and p63 may
function as oncogenes in the development of these tumors.

Identification of genes that are dysregulated in association with prostate
carcinogenesis can provide disease markers and clues relevant to disease
etiology. Of particular interest as candidate markers of disease are those genes 
that are frequently overexpressed. In this study, we describe a gene,
alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), whose expression is consistently
up-regulated in prostate cancer. Analysis of mRNA levels of AMACR revealed an
average up-regulation of approximately 9 fold in clinical prostate cancer
specimens compared with normal. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis
confirms the up-regulation at the protein level and localizes the enzyme
predominantly to the peroxisomal compartment of prostate cancer cells. A detailed
immunohistochemical analysis of samples from 168 primary prostate cancer cases
using both standard slides and tissue microarrays demonstrates that both prostate
carcinomas and the presumed precursor lesion (high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia) consistently scored significantly higher than matched 
normal prostate epithelium; 88% of the carcinomas had a staining score higher
than the highest score observed for any sample of normal prostate epithelium.
Both untreated metastases (n = 32 patients) and hormone refractory prostate
cancers (n = 14 patients) were generally strongly positive for AMACR. To extend
the utility of this marker for prostate cancer diagnosis, we combined staining
for cytoplasmic AMACR with staining for the nuclear protein, p63, a basal cell
marker in the prostate that is absent in prostate cancer. In a simple assay that 
can be useful for the diagnosis of prostate cancer on both biopsy and surgical
specimens, combined staining for p63 and AMACR resulted in a staining pattern
that greatly facilitated the identification of malignant prostate cells. The
enzyme encoded by the AMACR gene plays a critical role in peroxisomal beta
oxidation of branched chain fatty acid molecules. These observations could have
important epidemiological and preventive implications for prostate cancer, as the
main sources of branched chain fatty acids are dairy products and beef, the
consumption of which has been associated with an increased risk for prostate
cancer in multiple studies. On the basis of its consistency and magnitude of
cancer cell-specific expression, we propose AMACR as an important new marker of
prostate cancer and that its use in combination with p63 staining will form the
basis for an improved staining method for the identification of prostate
carcinomas. Furthermore, the absence of AMACR staining in the vast majority of
normal tissues coupled with its enzymatic activity makes AMACR the ideal
candidate for development of molecular probes for the noninvasive identification 
of prostate cancer by imaging modalities.

The tumour-suppressor protein p53 belongs to a family that includes 2
structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. Because of their structural homology,
it has been hypothesized that both homologues serve as "spare mechanisms" in p53 
mutations to regulate the cell cycle by inducing apoptosis. We investigated the
mutational and protein expression status of p53 in correlation to its homologues,
p73 and p63, in primary and recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and
neck (HNSCC) and corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa. Expression and mutation of
p53 and its homologues p63 (including the 2 major isotypes TAp63 and DeltaNp63)
and p73 was examined by direct DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry in 29
primary and 39 recurrent (secondary) HNSCCs after microdissection. Our results
were correlated with pathohistologic stage and grade. p53 mutations were detected
in 32/68 (47%) carcinomas of 17 patients, with a discordant mutation pattern of
primary and consecutive tumours in all cases. Positive immunostaining for p63 was
found in 55/68 (81%) carcinomas of 29 patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed p73
protein expression in 32/68 (47%) tumours. In normal mucosa, p63 and p73 were
expressed in 40/68 (59%) and 12/68 (18%) cases, respectively. We failed to detect
specific mutations of p73 or p63 in primary and recurrent carcinoma of the head
and neck. p73 and p63 were rarely mutated in HNSCC, but both were expressed in a 
subset of tumours. The lack of correlation between p73/p63 and p53 protein
expression suggests that neither p73 nor p63 can replace p53 when it is mutated.

The transcriptional co-activator p63 is of crucial importance for correct
development of the limbs, ectodermal appendages (skin, nails, teeth, hair,
glands), lip and palate. Mutations in the p63 gene are found in a number of human
syndromes, including ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC)
syndrome, limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), Hay-Wells syndrome and in non-syndromic
split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM). Each syndrome has a specific pattern
of mutations with different functional effects in in vitro functional assays. We 
report a mutation R298Q in acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome,
another EEC-like condition. The mutation is located in the DNA binding domain of 
p63, which harbors almost all EEC associated mutations. However, unlike mutations
in EEC syndrome, the R298Q ADULT syndrome mutation does not impair DNA binding.
Rather, the mutation confers novel transcription activation capacity on the
DeltaN-p63gamma isoform, which normally does not possess such activity. These
results confirm that ADULT syndrome is a clinically as well as molecularly
distinct member of the expanding p63 mutation family of human malformation
syndromes. Our results further show that p63 contains a second transactivation
domain which is normally repressed and can become activated by mutations in the
DNA binding domain of p63.

BACKGROUND: Germline mis-sense mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the p63
gene have recently been established as the molecular basis for the autosomal
dominant EEC (Ectrodactyly, Ectodermal dysplasia, Clefting) syndrome.
OBJECTIVES: To examine genomic DNA from a 36-year-old woman, her 58-year-old
father and her 11-year-old son, all with the EEC syndrome, to determine the
inherent p63 mutation and, after genetic counselling, to use knowledge of the
mutation to undertake a first-trimester DNA-based prenatal diagnosis in a
subsequent pregnancy.
METHODS: Fetal DNA was extracted from chorionic villi and used to amplify exon 7 
of p63 containing the potential mutation. Direct sequencing and restriction
endonuclease digestion (loss of AciI site on mutant allele) were used for
DNA-based prenatal diagnosis.
RESULTS: We identified a heterozygous arginine to histidine p63 mutation, R279H, 
in all three affected individuals. Prenatal diagnosis demonstrated a homozygous
wild-type sequence predicting an unaffected child: a healthy boy was subsequently
born at full-term.
CONCLUSIONS: These data expand the p63 gene mutation database and provide the
first example of a DNA-based prenatal test in this ectodermal dysplasia syndrome.

TP53 is probably the most extensively studied tumour-suppressor gene, and
patients with TP53 mutations are known to have a poor outcome. However,
inconsistencies in the analysis of TP53 status, and failure to realize that
different mutations behave in different ways, prevent us from effectively
applying our vast knowledge of this protein in clinical practice. What simple
steps can be taken to ensure that patients benefit from our understanding of
TP53?

The cornea provides the eye with protection and the refractive properties
essential for visual acuity. The transparent epithelium is highly specialized
with basal and stratified squamous cells that are renewed throughout life from a 
stem cell population. The stem cells are thought to reside at the corneal limbus 
and may be maintained by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as the
local environment, survival factors, and cytokines. A number of markers have been
localized to the limbus in an attempt to identify stem cells; however, definite
stem cell identification remains elusive. During homeostasis and following injury
to the corneal epithelium, the limbal stem cells divide to produce daughter
transient amplifying cells that proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to
replace lost cells. However, this cannot occur if the stem cell population is
depleted. Limbal stem cell deficiency then results in corneal
re-epithelialization by the neighboring conjunctiva, causing pain, poor vision,
and even blindness. This review will focus on corneal epithelial stem cells in
ocular surface repair and regeneration. The current knowledge of stem cell
biology in the corneal epithelium, clinical consequences of stem cell deficiency,
and therapeutic strategies aimed at reversing stem cell deficiency will be
discussed.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent target for genetic alterations
in human cancers, whereas the recently discovered homologues p73 and p63 are
rarely mutated. We and others have previously reported that human tumor-derived
p53 mutants can engage in a physical association with different isoforms of p73, 
inhibiting their transcriptional activity. Here, we report that human
tumor-derived p53 mutants can associate in vitro and in vivo with p63 through
their respective core domains. We show that the interaction with mutant p53
impairs in vitro and in vivo sequence-specific DNA binding of p63 and
consequently affects its transcriptional activity. We also report that in cells
carrying endogenous mutant p53, such as T47D cells, p63 is unable to recruit some
of its target gene promoters. Unlike wild-type p53, the binding to specific p53
mutants markedly counteracts p63-induced growth inhibition. This effect is, at
least partially, mediated by the core domain of mutant p53. Thus, inactivation of
p53 family members may contribute to the biological properties of specific p53
mutants in promoting tumorigenesis and in conferring selective survival advantage
to cancer cells.

Transcriptional dysregulation in skeletal malformation syndromes.

Normal skeletal development requires coordinated temporal and spatial gene
expression patterns that specify the functions of various cell types.
Transcription factors by definition coordinate this process and are themselves
subject to hierarchical levels of regulation. Together they determine the
context-dependent function of each transcription factor. Hence, loss-of-function 
and gain-of-function mutations within specific transcription factors cause
dysregulation of broad transcriptional networks. Consequences are usually
dominantly inherited skeletal malformation syndromes that can be broadly viewed
as consequences of defects of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and
survival versus defects in pattern formation. The study of human phenotypes and
mutations can lead to hypotheses about targets within the respective
transcriptional network. These targets can then be confirmed by combining mouse
genetic and in vitro studies. Although this has been successful in a small group 
of skeletal dysplasias, the majority of transcriptional networks during
skeletogenesis remain to be elucidated.

Mutations in the p53 homolog p63: allele-specific developmental syndromes in
humans.

p63 is the most recently discovered but most ancient member of the p53 family. In
marked contrast to p53, p63 is highly expressed in embryonic ectoderm and in the 
basal, regenerative layers of many epithelial tissues in the adult. The
p63-knockout mouse dies at birth and lacks limbs, epidermis, prostate, breast and
urothelial tissues, apparently owing to the loss of stem cells required for these
tissues. Significantly, several dominant human syndromes involving limb
development and/or ectodermal dysplasia have been mapped to chromosome 3q27 and
ultimately the gene encoding p63. The heterozygous p63mutations are distinct for 
each of the syndromes and are thought to act through both dominant-negative and
gain-of-function mechanisms rather than a loss-of-function haploinsufficiency.
The allele specificity of these syndromes offers unique molecular insights into
the poorly understood actions of p63 in limb development, ectodermal-mesodermal
interactions and stem cell maintenance.

Retinoic acid inhibits downregulation of DeltaNp63alpha expression during

Recently, the p53 homolog p63 has been implicated in sustaining the epidermal
stem cell population. The p63 gene encodes six major products with
transactivating or dominant-negative properties. The expression pattern of these 
isoforms in keratinocytes was investigated here. Northern blot, ribonuclease
protection assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and western
blot techniques sensitive for all six p63 isotypes verified the predominant
expression of the truncated and potentially dominant-negative isotype
DeltaNp63alpha in human keratinocytes. The expression of this isoform is
downregulated when proliferating human primary keratinocytes begin to
differentiate after growth factor withdrawal. The onset of differentiation does
not change the ratio of two other weakly expressed isotypes DeltaNp63gamma and
TAp63alpha relative to DeltaNp63alpha. Treatment of primary human keratinocytes
with all-trans retinoic acid does not alter the expression pattern of p63
isotypes but prevents its downregulation as observed in control cell cultures.
These data suggest that p63 expression in human keratinocytes is affected by
all-trans retinoic acid and this influence might contribute to the fine tuned
keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation equilibrium in the mammalian
epidermis.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene belongs to a multigene family that includes two
paralogues, p63 and p73. The structure of the p63 and p73 genes is quite similar,
but both have common activities with p53, such as DNA binding and
transactivation. Both p53 and p73 bind to mdm2, but only p53 is degraded through 
the activity of mdm2. p63 neither binds to nor is degraded by mdm2 despite
important conservation in the key interacting residues. Using a panel of
monoclonal antibodies raised against human and Xenopus p53, we have been able to 
find several antibodies that cross-react strongly with human p73. These
antibodies react both with exogenous p73 expressed in mammalian cells and with
endogenous p73. Interestingly, all these antibodies react with the same epitope
localized in the amino-terminus of p53, but have no cross-reaction with p63. This
epitope corresponds to the exact mdm2 binding site to p53. These antibodies
inhibit the interaction between either p53 or p73 and mdm2, and may be useful
tools for the study of these proteins. Furthermore, our studies suggest that
there exist specific spatial requirements for the interaction between p53 or p73 
and mdm2.

PURPOSE: The p63 gene, located on chromosome 3q27-28, is a member of the p53 gene
family. The product encoded by the p63 gene has been reported to be essential for
normal development.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we examined the expression pattern of p63 in 
human normal and tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal
antibody (clone 4A4) that recognizes all p63 splice variants, and by reverse
transcription-PCR using isoform-specific primers.
RESULTS: We found that p63 expression was restricted to the nucleus, with a
nucleoplasmic pattern. We also observed that the expression was restricted to
epithelial cells of stratified epithelia, such as skin, esophagus, exocervix,
tonsil, and bladder, and to certain subpopulations of basal cells in glandular
structures of prostate and breast, as well as in bronchi. Consistent with the
phenotype observed in normal tissues, we found that p63 is expressed
predominantly in basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, as well as transitional
cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas, including those of breast and
prostate. Interestingly, thymomas expressed high levels of p63. Moreover, a
subset of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was also found to express p63. Using
isoform-specific reverse transcription-PCR, we found that thymomas express all
isoforms of p63, whereas the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tended to express the
transactivation-competent isoforms. We did not detect p63 expression in a variety
of endocrine tumors, germ cell neoplasms, or melanomas. Additionally, soft tissue
sarcomas were also found to have undetectable p63 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a role for p63 in squamous and transitional cell
carcinomas, as well as certain lymphomas and thymomas.

p53 controls crucial stress responses that play a major role in preventing
malignant transformation. Hence, inactivation of p53 is the single most common
genetic defect in human cancer. With the recent discovery of two close structural
homologs, p63 en p73, we are getting a broader view of a fascinating gene family 
that links developmental biology with tumor biology. While unique roles are
apparent for each of these genes, intimate biochemical cross-talk among family
members suggests a functional network that might influence many different aspects
of individual gene action. The most interesting part of this family network
derives from the fact that the p63 and p73 genes are based on the
"two-genes-in-one" idea, encoding both agonist and antagonist in the same open
reading frame. In this review, we attempt to present an overview of the current
status of this fast moving field.

The discoveries of the p53 homologs, p63 and p73, have both fueled new insights
and exposed enigmas in our understanding of the iconic p53 tumor suppressor.
Although the pivotal role of p53 in cancer pathways remains unchallenged, because
p63 and p73 are now implicated in stem cell identity, neurogenesis, natural
immunity and homeostatic control. Despite their seemingly separate tasks, there
are hints that the p53 family members both collaborate and interfere with one
another. The question remains, therefore, as to whether these genes evolved to
function independently or whether their familial ties still bind them in pathways
of cell proliferation, death and tumorigenesis.

In the mouse female reproductive tract, p63, a homologue of the p53 tumor
suppressor gene, is highly expressed in basal cells of the vaginal and cervical
epithelium, but not in the uterine epithelium. P63 is undetectable in the
undifferentiated epithelium of the embryonic Müllerian duct. The Mullerian
vaginal epithelium becomes p63 positive and stratified during the first week of
postnatal development. P63 expression in the Müllerian vaginal epithelium is
induced by vaginal mesenchyme. When vaginal mesenchyme was combined with uterine 
epithelium from newborn mouse, the uterine epithelium was induced to undergo
vaginal differentiation and to express p63. Conversely, when the vaginal
epithelium from the newborn mouse was recombined with uterine mesenchyme, it
underwent uterine differentiation and failed to express p63. After the uterine
epithelium or vaginal epithelium differentiates, the expression status of p63 in 
uterine (negative) and vaginal (positive) epithelia is not altered by heterotypic
mesenchyme. Studies with p63-null mice demonstrate that p63 is essential for
vaginal epithelial differentiation, because p63-null Müllerian vaginal epithelium
developed as uterine epithelium. Thus, p63 determines whether Müllerian duct
epithelial cells become uterine or vaginal. Misexpression of p63 in uterine and
vaginal epithelial lesions induced by neonatal diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure 
induces pathological changes. Irregularities in p63 expression (and thus
epithelial differentiation) are observed in the uterine and vaginal epithelia of 
neonatally DES-exposed mice during the first week of postnatal development. Thus,
neonatal DES exposure abnormally transforms uterine and vaginal epithelial
differentiation by perturbing epithelial expression of p63 during development.

We report the prenatal diagnosis at 16 weeks' gestation of bilateral
split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHSFM) with severe lobster claw deformity of 
hands and feet in a male fetus without associated malformations. A minor
manifestation of SHSFM was present in the father with only mild bilateral foot
involvement (syndactyly I-II; cleft II-III; left cutaneous syndactyly III-IV).
Mutation analysis of the p63 gene on chromosome 3q27 showed a missense mutation
577A-->G (predicting amino acid substitution K193E) in the father. This mutation 
has not been reported so far in SHSFM but resembles the previously reported
580A-->G (predicting amino acid substitution K194E) in a family with SHSFM.

Carcinogenesis involves a multistep process whereby a normal healthy cell
undergoes both immortalization and oncogenesis to become fully transformed.
Immortalization results from the subversion of critical cell cycle regulatory
checkpoints, thereby allowing a cell to extend its finite life span and to
maintain telomeric length. Oncogenesis is the manifestation of additional genetic
events that are capable of conferring upon the cell an actual growth advantage.
Such an advantage may relieve a cell of its normal requirements for a particular 
growth factor or may enhance the ability of a cell to proliferate outside of its 
normal microenvironment. To further investigate this multistep process, we
developed an immortalized mammary epithelial cell line by overexpressing the
catalytic subunit of telomerase (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) in
primary human mammary epithelial cell lines. We present evidence that the
overexpression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase was sufficient to extend
the life span of the cells and allow for additional events that lead to
immortalization. The result was the establishment of an IMEC line. Biochemical
analysis of these cells indicates a basal epithelial phenotype with expression of
high molecular weight cytokeratins. We show that continued growth of the IMECs is
rigorously dependent upon both insulin and epidermal growth factor, and that the 
mitogenic effects of these factors on the IMECs are mediated in part by AKT. In
addition, IMECs express the p53 family member DeltaN-p63-alpha, which is found in
basal epithelial cells of many tissues and has been implicated as playing an
essential role in normal epithelial development. Our studies suggest that the
immortalization of basal epithelial cells of the mammary gland may be an early
step in the initiation of a subset of breast cancers with a basal epithelial
phenotype.

Value of p63 and cytokeratin 5/6 as immunohistochemical markers for the
differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas.

To facilitate the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated metastatic
carcinomas of unknown primary site, we evaluated p63 and cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 as 
immunohistochemical markers for squamous cell carcinomas. The study cases were as
follows: squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs, head/neck, esophagus, cervix
uteri, or anal canal, 73; non-squamous cell carcinomas of various primary sites, 
141; and urothelial carcinoma, 20. We also tested 14 malignant mesotheliomas.
Immunoreactivity for p63 was as follows: squamous cell carcinomas, 59 (81%);
urothelial carcinoma, 14 (70%), most often with diffuse staining patterns;
non-squamous cell carcinomas, 20 (14.2%), resulting in a specificity of 0.86 of
p63 for squamous cell carcinomas. Coexpression of p63 and CK5/6 had a sensitivity
of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.96 for squamous cell carcinomas. Increasing the
minimal criterion of positive immunostaining for both markers to more than 50% of
immunoreactive tumor cells resulted in a specificity of 0.99, although the
sensitivity diminished to 0.66. All malignant mesotheliomas were negative for
p63. Our data suggest that positive immunostaining for both p63 and CK5/6 in
poorly differentiated metastatic carcinomas is highly predictive of a primary
tumor of squamous epithelial origin.

The p63 gene, a member of the p53 gene family, is expressed into at least six
protein isoforms which are divided into two groups, those containing the
transcription activation domain (TA isoforms) and those that do not (Delta N
isoforms). The TA isoforms are similar to p53 in that they are able to activate
transcription of specific target genes and induce cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. The Delta N isoforms are unable to activate transcription, and act in 
a dominant negative manner, inhibiting transcription activation by both p53 and
TA isoforms. p63 knock-out studies in mice have shown that p63 plays an important
role in development rather than in tumour suppression. In humans, mutations in
the p63 gene have been linked with several developmental abnormalities. Studies
on human tumours suggest an oncogenic function for Delta N isoforms rather than a
tumour suppressor function for the TA forms.

p63 is a p53-related DNA-binding protein that helps regulate differentiation and 
proliferation in epithelial progenitor cells. Its expression has never been
evaluated in the human gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the expression of p63 in the esophagus and related metaplastic and
neoplastic disorders to gain insight into the pathogenesis of these processes. Of
particular interest was the expression of p63 in Barrett esophagus (BE) and in
BE-associated multilayered epithelium. Multilayered epithelium has been
postulated to represent an early precursor to the development of BE primarily
because it shares morphologic and immunophenotypic features of both squamous and 
columnar epithelium, and has been shown prospectively to be highly associated
with BE. Routinely processed mucosal biopsy or resection specimens that contained
normal esophageal squamous epithelium (n = 20), squamous dysplasia (n = 4),
squamous cell carcinoma (n = 7), BE (n = 10), BE-associated multilayered
epithelium (n = 13), esophageal mucosal gland ducts (n = 10), BE-associated
dysplasia (n = 12), and BE-associated adenocarcinoma (n = 7) were immunostained
for p63 to determine the extent and location of staining. p63 staining was
compared with the staining patterns observed for p53, Ki 67 (proliferation
marker), and cytokeratins (CKs) 13 (squamous marker), 14 (basal squamous marker),
8/18 (columnar marker), and 19 (basal/columnar marker). Expression of p63
messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms was also analyzed by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction of freshly isolated tissues. In the normal esophagus,
p63 was expressed in the basal and suprabasal layers of the squamous epithelium
and in basal cells that line the mucosal gland ducts but was negative in all
other epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small
intestine, and colon. Similarly, p63 was not expressed in BE, but it, was present
in the basal layer of multilayered epithelium in 9 of 13 cases (69%).
p63-positive cells in multilayered epithelium and in the mucosal gland duct
epithelium were positive for CK8/18 (100%) and CK13 (67% and 30%, respectively)
and negative for CK14 (0%), in contrast to p63-positive cells in squamous
epithelium, which were positive for CK14 and CK13 (100%) but negative for CK8/18.
In neoplastic tissues, p63 was diffusely expressed in all cases of esophageal
squamous cell dysplasia and carcinoma but was negative in all cases of esophageal
and colorectal adenocarcinoma. The DeltaN isoform of p63 mRNA predominated in all
benign and neoplastic squamous tissues examined. p63 may represent a marker of 2 
distinct epithelial progenitor cells (basal squamous epithelium and gland duct
epithelium) in the esophagus. P63 is upregulated in squamous neoplastic
conditions and in this manner may play a role in squamous carcinogenesis. These
data also indicate that multilayered epithelium is phenotypically similar to, and
may share a lineage relationship with, mucosal gland duct epithelium.

Genetic alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which monitors DNA damage
and operates cell cycle checkpoints, is a major factor in the development of
human malignancies. The p53 protein belongs to a family that also includes two
structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. Although all three proteins share
similar transcriptional functions and antiproliferative effects, each of them
appears to play a distinct role in development and tumor suppression. One of the 
principal regulators of p53 activity is the MDM2 protein. The interaction of MDM2
with p53 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and targets p53 for
ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The ability of MDM2 to inhibit p53 functions is 
antagonized by the ARF oncosuppressor protein. We show here that like p53, the
p63alpha and p63gamma isoforms are able to associate with human MDM2 (HDM2).
Overexpression of HDM2 increased the steady-state level of intracellular p63 and 
enhanced its transcriptional activity. Both effects appeared to be counteracted
by ARF coexpression. These data indicate that p63 can be activated by HDM2 under 
conditions in which p53 is inhibited. Therefore, HDM2 expression could support
p63-specific transcriptional functions on a common set of genes, keeping
interference by p53 at a minimum.

The p51/p63 gene, a novel member of the p53 gene family, has recently been
identified at 3q27-9. There are at least six major isotypes of p51/p63 mRNA
transcripts. p51A/TAp63gamma has the potential to induce apoptosis and growth
suppression in a manner similar to p53, and other isotypes may suppress the p53
and p51A1TAp63gamma genes in a dominant-negative manner. We analyzed the mutation
and expression of the p51/p63 gene in 80 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) to evaluate its role in blastic transformation. Expression of the p51/p63
gene was detected in 74 cases. The alpha isotype of p51/p63 transcripts was
dominantly expressed in 72 of these 74 cases. There was no correlation between
the isotypes of p51/p63 transcripts and the clinical phase. Mutations of the
p51/p63 gene were found in six cases. All these mutated cases expressed
p51B/TAp63 alpha. In four of the six cases, the mutations were within a limited
region (codon 151-170) corresponding to the DNA-binding domain. We hypothesized
that this limited region is a hot spot for mutation of the p51/p63 gene.
Mutations of the p53 gene were found in four cases of CML in blastic crisis (BC).
Frequencies of the p51/p63 and p53 gene mutations were higher in BC (p51/p63
gene, 11.8%; p53 gene, 7.8%) than in the chronic phase (p51/p63 gene, 1.5%; p53
gene, 0%). The p51/p63 gene mutation may act similarly to the p53 gene mutation
as a genetic alteration potentially responsible for the progression of CML.

To better understand cellular responses in human lymphoblastoid cell TK6 after
exposure to C-ion (22 keV/micrometer) and Fe-ion (1000 keV/micrometer), both
protein induction and cell-cycle progression have been extensively analyzed by
the recently developed techniques. While proceeding this line of analyses, we
realized the importance of studying low-dose effect, in relation to the genetic
alterations. Adaptive response by 5~20 cGy of such C- or Fe-ion irradiation to
both lethal and mutagenic effects of the challenging X-ray exposure (1~3 Gy) was 
difficult to be seen in this TK6 cells, but surprisingly, a relatively high level
of p53 and its related proteins induction was observed after low-dose
irradiations of heavy-ions. Here, we focus to introduce the above results of

The p53 tumor suppressor protein is mutated in more than 50% of all human
cancers, which makes the study of its functions and activities critical for the
understanding and management of cancer. In response to cellular stresses, p53 is 
activated and can mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis via the upregulation
of numerous target genes. Here, we have identified EphA2 as a target gene of the 
p53 family, that is, p53, p73, and p63. We also found that an increase of EphA2
transcript levels correlated with an increase of EphA2 protein expression, and
induction of EphA2 in response to DNA damage corresponded with p53 activation.
Furthermore, we identified a p53 response element located within the EphA2
promoter that is responsive to wild-type p53, p73, and p63, but not mutant p53.
Interestingly, the ligand for EphA2, ephrin-A1, is also regulated by p53. EphA2
and ephrin-A1 are members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and
ligands, which are implicated in a number of developmental processes. To analyse 
the role of EphA2 in p53-mediated tumor suppression, we generated stable cell
lines capable of expressing exogenous EphA2 in a tetracycline-repressible system.
We found that EphA2 expression resulted in an increase in apoptosis. Thus, we
hypothesize that the activated EphA2 may serve to impair anti-apoptotic
signaling, perhaps by disrupting focal adhesions and thereby sensitize cells to
pro-apoptotic stimuli.

The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and
death in response to environmental stimuli such as DNA damage. p63/p51 and p73
were recently identified as members of the p53 gene family. In contrast to p53
however, p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers. Mice that lack p53 are 
developmentally normal, while p63 and p73 appear to play critical roles in normal
development. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in normal development, we 
attempted to identify target genes that are specifically regulated by p63 and/or 
p73 but not by p53. We found that the Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2) genes,
encoding ligands for the Notch receptors, are up-regulated by p63 and p73.
Furthermore, we identified a p63-binding site in the second intron of the JAG1
gene, which can directly interact with the p63 protein in vivo, as assessed by a 
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A heterologous reporter assay revealed that 
this p63-binding site is a functional response element and is specific for p63.
We also found a target of Notch signaling, HES-1 was up-regulated in Jurkat
cells, in which Notch1 is highly expressed, when co-cultured with p63-transfected
cells, suggesting that p63 can trigger the Notch signal pathway in neighboring
cells. Our findings show an association between the p53 family genes and Notch
signaling and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for the involvement of the 
p53 family genes in normal development.

Education, Warsaw School of Medicine, Poland.

p63, a recently identified member of the p53 family, was shown to play a role in 
morphogenesis and, probably, in tumors of keratinocyte origin. Because p63 seems 
to be a marker of keratinocytes with a high proliferative potential, the
expression of this protein was studied along with another marker of cell
proliferation, Ki67, during normal epidermal regeneration in humans. Serial
biopsies of human skin healing by a secondary intention were taken at various
time intervals (between days 2 and 21 after the injury) and were studied
immunohistochemically with the use of a 4A4 monoclonal antibody against the
DeltaNp63 variant and MM1 monoclonal antibody against the Ki67 antigen. In the
normal and injured skin, the expression of the DeltaNp63 protein was restricted
to the epidermal keratinocytes and hair follicle keratinocytes. In the first days
of the healing process, there was a dramatic down-regulation of both DeltaNp63
and Ki67 expression in the area of the epidermal tongue invading under the crust.
Five days after the injury, induction of DeltaNp63 in the basal keratinocytes
could be detected, followed by a gradual increase of its expression in subsequent
days. Several days after complete wound closure, DeltaNp63 was still strongly
expressed not only in the basal keratinocytes but also in the entire spinous
layer, whereas the Ki67 expression was restricted to single cells in the basal
layer. The results indicate that DeltaNp63 could be involved in the control of
physiologic processes, such as cell proliferation and migration, related to
epidermal repair during healing of normal skin in humans.

Expression of the p53 homologue p63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha in the neoplastic
sequence of Barrett's oesophagus: correlation with morphology and p53 protein.

BACKGROUND: While loss of p53 function is a key oncogenic step in human
tumorigenesis, mutations of p53 are generally viewed as late events in the
metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence of Barrett's oesophagus. Recent
reports of a series of genes (p63, p73, and others) exhibiting close homology to 
p53 raise the possibility that abnormalities of these p53 family members may
exert their influence earlier in the sequence.
AIM: Following recent characterisation of expression of p63 and a major isoform
DeltaNp63 by generation of an antiserum that recognises p63 isoforms, but not
p53, our aim was a comparative study of expression of p63 protein and p53 protein
in a morphologically well defined biopsy series representative of all stages of
the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in Barrett's oesophagus.
METHODS: A series of 60 biopsy cases representing normal oesophagus through to
invasive adenocarcinoma were stained, using immunohistochemistry, with antibodies
to p63 and p53. All biopsies derived from patients with endoscopic and
histopathological substantiation of a diagnosis of traditional/classical
Barrett's oesophagus.
RESULTS: There was exact concordance in p53 and p63 expression in more advanced
forms of neoplasia, high grade dysplasia, and invasive adenocarcinoma, while p63,
but not p53, was detected in the proliferative compartment of some non-neoplastic
oesophageal tissue, in both squamous mucosa and in the non-neoplastic metaplastic
glandular epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS: In neoplastic Barrett's oesophagus there is upregulation of both p63
and p53 while p63 isoforms may well have an important role in epithelial biology 
in both non-metaplastic and metaplastic mucosa of the oesophagus. While
abnormalities of p53 function represent an indisputable and critical element of
neoplastic transformation, other closely linked genes and their proteins have a
role in both the physiology and pathophysiology of the oesophageal mucosa.

cancer diagnosis and carcinogenesis.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the expression of the p63 protein in normal,
preneoplastic, and neoplastic human prostatic tissue. The p63 gene, a member of
the p53 gene family, is expressed in the basal epithelial cells of multiple
organs. Irregularities in p63 expression have been associated with epithelial
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We performed immunohistochemistry with an anti-p63 antibody on specimens
from radical prostatectomies, prostate needle biopsies, and metastatic prostate
adenocarcinoma. We analyzed p63 expression in regions of normal prostate, benign 
prostatic hyperplasia, proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), high-grade
intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma.
RESULTS: Basal epithelial cells in normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and
high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia tissue stained intensely for the p63
polypeptide, but the vast majority of adenocarcinoma specimens from 233
patients-66 (94%) of 70 radical prostatectomies, 132 (89%) of 148 prostate needle
biopsies, and 14 (93%) of 15 metastases-did not. In tumors in which the
adenocarcinoma cells were positive, the staining intensity was weak and occurred 
in less than 1% of the cells. Tumors that stained positive for p63 were more
likely to be high grade than those that did not (P <0.0001). Basal cells in PIA
expressed p63, but these cells were sparsely distributed relative to the basal
cells in the normal glands. Luminal cells in PIA were, in general, negative for
p63.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to normal and preneoplastic prostatic tissue, the vast
majority of prostate adenocarcinomas do not express p63. Therefore, p63
immunohistochemistry represents a potential novel adjuvant method for
facilitating the pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer in prostate needle
biopsies. The selective expression of p63 in normal basal cells, coupled with the
finding that p63 null mice fail to develop prostates, provides strong evidence
that the basal cells represent prostatic epithelial stem cells. In addition,
these findings suggest that p63 may protect prostatic epithelial cells against
neoplastic transformation and support the hypothesis that intermediately
differentiated cells in the luminal epithelium of PIA are the targets of
neoplastic transformation in the prostate.

The TP53 tumour-suppressor gene belongs to a family that includes the two
recently identified homologues TP63 and TP73. Overexpression of p73 can activate 
typical p53-responsive genes and induce apoptosis like p53. In addition,
activation of p73 has been implicated in apoptotic cell death induced by aberrant
cell proliferation and some forms of DNA-damage. These data together with the
localization of TP73 on chromosome 1p36, a region frequently deleted in a variety
of human cancers, led to the hypothesis that p73 has tumour suppressor activity
just like p53. However, despite its proapoptotic activity in vitro, the lack of
tumour-formation in p73 knock-out mice and primary human tumour data
demonstrating overexpression of wild-type p73 currently argue against p73 being a
classical tumour suppressor. Interestingly, in contrast to TP53, TP73 gives rise 
to a complex pattern of pro- and antiapoptotic p73 isoforms generated by
differential splicing and alternative promoter usage. Therefore further insight
into the function and regulation of these structurally and functionally diverse
p73 proteins is needed to elucidate the role of TP73 for apoptosis and human
tumorigenesis.

Congenital malformations of the extremities are conspicuous and have been
described through the ages. Over the past decade, a wealth of knowledge has been 
generated regarding the genetic regulation of limb development and the underlying
molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have identified several of the signaling
molecules, growth factors, and transcriptional regulators involved in the
initiation and maintenance of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) as well as the
molecular markers defining the three axes of the developing limb. Studies of
abnormal murine phenotypes have uncovered the role played by genes such as p63
and Dactylin in the maintenance of AER activity. These phenotypes resemble human 
malformations and in this review we describe the underlying mechanisms and
clinical associations of split hand/foot malformation and ectrodactyly-ectodermal
dysplasia-cleft lip/palate syndrome, which have both been associated with
mutations in the p63 gene.

Recent studies have identified two p53 homologues, p63 and p73. They activate
p53-responsive promoters and induce apoptosis when overexpressed in certain human
tumors. Here, we report that p63, like p53 and p73, induces replicative
senescence when expressed in a tetracycline-regulated manner in EJ cells lacking 
a functional p53. In addition to transcription activation of p53-responsive
genes, we found that p63 and p73 repress transcription of the cdk1 and cyclin B
genes, both of which are irreversibly repressed in senescent human fibroblast. In
transient transfection assay, p63 and p73 repress the cdk1 promoter regardless of
the presence of a dominant negative mutant form of p53. Furthermore, we found
that DNA binding activity of NF-Y transcription factor, which is essential for
transcription of the cdk1 and cyclin B genes and inactivated in senescent
fibroblast, is significantly decreased by expression of either of p53, p63, or
p73. Since NF-Y binds to many promoters besides the cdk1 and cyclin B promoters, 
inactivation of NF-Y by p53 family genes may be a general mechanism for
transcription repression in replicative senescence.

The tumour-suppressor protein p53 has recently been shown to belong to a family
that includes two structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. This study
investigated the status of p53 and its two homologues in multiple simultaneous
gastric carcinomas. Expression and mutation of p53, p73 and p63 including the two
major isotypes TAp63 and black triangleNp63, were examined by direct
DNA-sequencing, in situ hybridization, western blotting and immunohistochemistry 
in 68 gastric carcinomas of 32 patients. The results obtained were correlated
with pathohistological stage (according to UICC(16)) and several other
histopathological factors and finally with patient survival. p53 mutations were
detected in 23/68 carcinomas (34%) from 18 patients with a discordant mutation
pattern. Independently of p53 mutation status, p73 transcripts and protein
expression were found in 33/68 carcinomas from 24 patients. p63 positivity was
found in 21 patients; 25 out of 68 tumours expressed p63. The number of cells
containing p63 and their distribution depend on the degree of tumour
differentiation. High grade carcinomas of the diffuse type exhibited a
significantly higher p63 expression. In intestinal metaplasia and atrophic
gastritis, an increase of TAp63 and black triangleNp63 staining was also
observed. Specific mutations of p73 or p63 causing amino acid substitutions were 
not identified. Neither p53, p73 nor p63 were related to prognosis. p73 and p63
have rarely been found to be mutated in gastric carcinomas, but both proteins
were expressed in only a subset of tumours. The status of these p53 homologues
was discordant in all patients with multiple simultaneous gastric carcinomas. The
increased expression of p63 (TAp63 and black triangleNp63) in less well
differentiated gastric carcinomas may indicate that p63 can act to promote
neoplastic growth in the gastric epithelium.

p53 gene therapy is being tested clinically for the treatment of human cancer,
however, some cancer models (in vivo and in vitro) are resistant to p53. To
explore the potential use of two p53 homologues, p73 and p51/p63, in cancer gene 
therapy, we introduced p53, p73 and p51/p63 into colorectal cancer cell lines via
adenoviral vectors, and compared their effects on cell growth. Among 10 cell
lines tested, six cell lines displayed a similar response following transduction 
of p53, p73beta or p51A/p63gamma; two lines underwent cell-cycle arrest, three
lines exhibited apoptosis and one line showed no-effect following transduction.
The effect on cell-cycle progression was variable in the other four cell lines.
Interestingly, three cell lines were resistant to p53-mediated apoptosis,
including two lines having endogenous wild-type p53 alleles, but underwent
apoptosis after transduction of p73beta or p51A/p63gamma. Similar to p53,
transduction of p51A/p63gamma induced extensive apoptosis when combined with
adriamycin or X-radiation in SW480 cells, which are normally resistant to
apoptosis. Transduction of p73beta and p51A/p63gamma also reduced the
tumorigenicity of two colorectal cancer cells in vivo. These results suggest that
adenovirus-mediated p73beta and p51A/p63gamma transfer are potential novel
approaches for the treatment of human cancers, particularly for tumors that are
resistant to p53 gene therapy.

Tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to transactivate epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) expression through binding to a putative p53 responsive element
in the EGFR promoter between nucleotides -265 and -239 (EGFRp53RE). Isotypes of
p63 gene products, recently identified as p53 relatives, have a similar function 
to transactivate several p53 target gene promoters. However, our results indicate
that TAp63gamma has a very low ability to bind to the EGFRp53RE and surprisingly 
represses both basal EGFR promoter activity and endogenous EGFR expression.
Transient transfection assays show that the EGFR promoter region between -348 and
-293, containing two Sp1 sites, is crucial for the repression of the EGFR
expression by TAp63gamma. Mutations in these Sp1 sites in the reporter constructs
result in loss of the TAp63gamma repression effect. We further show that
TAp63gamma directly interacts with Sp1 by immunoprecipitation analysis and that
TAp63gamma impairs Sp1 binding to the target DNA site in electrophoretic mobility
shift assays. These results suggest that TAp63gamma is involved in the regulation
of the EGFR gene expression through interactions with basal transcription
factors.

P73, a p53-homologue gene, has been studied for its possible role in head and
neck squamous epithelium (HNSE) differentiation and carcinogenesis. P73 RNA and
protein were analysed in 50 biopsies, including well- and
moderately-differentiated carcinomas, and 21 matched normal adjacent tissues. P73
immunohistochemical analyses revealed intense p73 nuclear staining in basal and
parabasal cells of normal squamous epithelium, in contrast with complete absence 
of staining in the more superficial cell layers. Moderately-differentiated
carcinomas demonstrated homogeneous and diffuse staining in all tumour cells,
while only basal cells were stained in well-differentiated carcinomas as in
normal tissue. No correlation was observed between p73 and p53 protein
expression. Immunostaining for p63, another p53-related protein previously
described as being involved in HNSE morphogenesis and overexpressed in head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), was found to be similar to p73 labelling
in carcinomas, but spread to the more differentiated layers in normal epithelium.
Biallelic expression of p73 was found in tumours as well as in matched normal
tissues. Comparison of p73 transcript levels between tumours and normal tissues
showed decreased mRNA expression in 5/17 (30%) tumours independently of the
differentiation status. Mutation and loss of heterozygosity analyses of the p73
gene revealed wild type status and no deletion. Our results strongly suggest
that: (i) p73 is associated with homeostasis and control of differentiation of
head and neck squamous epithelium probably in concert with p53 and p63; (ii)
down-regulation of p73 expression could participate in HNSE carcinogenesis.

The human homolog of KET, p63, bears strong homology to the tumor suppressor p53 
and plays an essential role in epithelial development. CUSP, the most abundant
cutaneous product of p63, has been identified as an autoantigen in chronic
ulcerative stomatitis (CUS). The original report of KET expression at least
partially contradicts p63 expression subsequently reported by many different
groups. We have examined p63 expression by Northern analysis of RNA from multiple
human tissues and by indirect immunofluorescence of rat tissue with CUS patient
sera. Northern analysis reveals p63 RNA in skin, thymus, placenta, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung, with non-transactivating p63 RNA in skin, thymus, and
placenta. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays show
abundant non-transactivating p63 RNA, and little to no transactivating p63 RNA,
in human basal cell carcinoma as well as in normal skin adjacent to the tumors.
p63 RNA expression was not detected in brain, heart, colon, spleen, liver, or
small intestine. Immunofluorescence reveals p63 expression in skin, oral
epithelium, tongue, kidney, and trachea, but not in liver, large intestine,
testis, skeletal muscle, or heart. Focal p63 expression within tissues, the
complex array of isoforms encoded by the gene, and the specificity of the probes 
and antibodies utilized, may all contribute to contradictory accounts of CUSP/p63
expression.

In Europe, high incidence rates of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCE) are
observed in western France (Normandy and Brittany) and in north-eastern Italy.
Analysis of TP53 mutations in tumours from these regions has shown a high
prevalence of mutations at A:T basepairs that may result from DNA damage caused
by specific mutagens. However, the spectrum of TP53 mutations in regions of low
incidence is unknown. We report here TP53 mutation analysis in 33 SCCE collected 
in Lyon, an area of low incidence. These tumours were also examined for MDM2 and 
P63 amplification, and for expression of p16(INK4a/CDKN2a), cyclin E,
p27(Kipl)and Cox2. TP53 mutations were detected in 36% of the cases (12/33). In
contrast with regions of high incidence, the mutation spectrum did not show a
high prevalence of mutations at A:T base pairs. P63 was amplified in 5/32 cases
tested (15.5%). No amplification of MDM2 was found. Expression studies revealed
frequent loss of p16(INK4a/CDKN2a)(46%) and p27(Kipl)(25%) expression, and
frequent overexpression of Cyclin E (70%) and Cox2 (42%). Overall, these results 
indicate that in Europe, SCCE from areas of high and low incidence present a
similar pattern of molecular alterations but differ by the type of TP53
mutations.

TP63 gene mutations have recently been shown to be disease causing in EEC and
SHFM. Two other overlapping syndromes with ectrodactyly as a major feature, have 
been mapped to chromosome 3q27 close by the TP63 locus, namely the LMS and ADULT 
syndromes. Here, we report on a missense TP63 gene mutation in an isolated ADULT 
syndrome case. This finding widens the spectrum of abnormalities to be ascribed

The p53 gene family, comprising p53, p63, and p73, has overlapping and
distinctive functional roles. These members share structural similarities
allowing for dynamic interplay in the activation of genes that are important in
development and key cellular functions, such as the induction of apoptosis.
Whereas p53 is a classical tumor suppressor gene, p63 and p73 do not share this
feature in cancer formation and progression. The compensation in the expression
level of these members in a background that is deficient for one of them has not 
been examined previously. Given the importance of p63 in the development and
differentiation of oral-esophageal stratified squamous epithelia and the absence 
of oral-esophageal tumors in p53-null mice, we postulated and describe herein
that p63 expression is associated with the loss of p53 in a p53-deficient
background. Both full-length and amino-truncated forms of p63 are expressed and
increased in oral-esophageal epithelia of p53-null mice when compared with
wild-type mice, and the induction of p21 may potentially be preserved through the
increase of p63.

The p51/p73L/p63/p40 gene, recently identified as a p53 homolog, encodes two
major isoforms, p51A and p73L, which are suggested to have similar functions
synonymous with p53 and dominant-negative activity toward both p53 and p51A,
respectively. We have cloned a high affinity genomic fragment bound to p51A that 
was assigned to be a novel retrovirus long terminal repeat. Strikingly, this
fragment was found to bind to both p53 and p73L with similar affinity to p51A.
Additional demonstration with known p53 response elements suggested that
DNA-binding profiles of p51A and p73L were very similar but were distinct from
that of p53. Consistent with this novel finding, transient cotransfection
experiments in mammalian cells suggested that p73L, when it was expressed at a
low level, selectively suppressed p53-dependent transactivation of p21-luc and
mdm2-luc but not of cyclinG-luc and bax-luc reporters. These data raise the
possibility that p73L differentially modulates the p53 function according to the 
distinct DNA-binding affinity between these two proteins.

The p53 protein is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To ensure that
cells under non-stressed conditions are able to grow, p53 sets up a negative
feedback loop by inducing Mdm2. Mdm2 is able to both inhibit the transcriptional 
regulation by p53 and to degrade it, thus maintaining p53 inactive until it is
required. The Mdm2 related protein, Hdmx, has also been shown to inhibit the
transcriptional activation of p53 but is unable to degrade it. A few years ago,
the p53 family member, p63 was identified. Like p53, p63 is able to induce p53
target genes and it was shown to be able to cause cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. In this study we report that, despite the similarities between p53 and
p63, neither Hdmx nor Mdm2 are able to interact with p63, to repress p63-induced 
transcription or to affect its half-life.

The p53 protein is the major tumor suppressor in mammals. The discovery of the
p53 homologs p63 and p73 defined a family of p53 members with distinct roles in
tumor suppression, differentiation, and development. Here, we describe the
biochemical characterization of the core DNA-binding domain of a human isoform of
p63, p63-delta, and particularly novel features in comparison with p53. In
contrast to p53, the free p63 core domain did not show specific binding to p53
DNA consensus sites. However, glutathione S-transferase-fused and thus dimerized 
p63 and p53 core domains had similar affinity and specificity for the p53
consensus sites p21, gadd45, cyclin G, and bax. Furthermore, the fold of p63 core
was remarkably stable compared with p53 as judged by differential scanning
calorimetry (T(m) = 61 degrees C versus 44 degrees C for p53) and equilibrium
unfolding ([urea](50%) = 5.2 m versus 3.1 m for p53). A homology model of p63
core highlights differences at a segment near the H1 helix hypothetically
involved in the formation of the dimerization interface in p53, which might
reduce cooperativity of p63 core DNA binding compared with p53. The model also
shows differences in the electrostatic and hydrophobic potentials of the domains 
relevant to folding stability.

Myoepithelial cells (MCs) constitute the basal cell layer of normal mammary
epithelia, and their identification is of particular diagnostic value because
they are retained in most benign lesions while being lost in malignancy. Several 
MC immunocytochemical markers are currently available for diagnostic purposes,
with special reference to smooth muscle-related antigens. p63 is a member of the 
p53 gene family, and its germline mutations are associated with severe mammary
developmental defects in both rodents and humans. Different p63 isoforms have
been identified, some of which (DeltaNp63) are preferentially expressed in the
epithelial basal cells of different organs and have been considered as possible
markers of stem cells/reserve cells. We investigated immunohistochemically 384
samples of normal and diseased human breast, including 300 invasive carcinomas,
using four antibodies recognizing all p63 isoforms, or the DeltaNp63 isoforms.
Twenty cytologic specimens were also investigated. Furthermore, snap-frozen
tissue samples from three fibroadenomas and 10 invasive ductal carcinomas with
their paired non-neoplastic tissues and three corresponding lymph node metastases
were evaluated for the expression of p63 mRNA by RT-PCR. In normal breast tissue 
p63 immunoreactivity was confined to the nuclei of MCs. In all benign lesions
p63-immunoreactive cells formed a continuous basal rim along the epithelial
structures. Stromal cells, and in particular myofibroblasts, were consistently
unreactive. Adenomyoepitheliomas showed nuclear staining in most neoplastic
cells. A peripheral rim of p63-immunoreactive cells was retained surrounding
lobular and ductal carcinoma in situ, although it was discontinuous as opposed to
the normal structures. Invasive breast carcinomas were consistently devoid of
nuclear p63 staining, with the exception of the two adenoid-cystic carcinomas, of
the two ductal carcinomas with squamous metaplasia, and of 11 (4.6%) ductal
carcinomas not otherwise specified, showing p63 immunoreactivity in a minor
fraction (5-15%) of the neoplastic cells. In comparison with other MC markers,
p63 was the most specific, being restricted exclusively to MCs, whereas
antibodies to smooth muscle actin and, to a lesser extent, calponin also
decorated stromal myofibroblasts. In the cytologic preparations p63
immunoreactivity was a consistent feature of "naked nuclei" and of a subset of
cells surrounding benign epithelial clusters. RT-PCR experiments with primers
specific for different p63 isoforms documented that normal tissues and
fibroadenomas preferentially expressed the DeltaNp63 isoforms. Our study
demonstrates that in normal and pathologic breast tissues MCs consistently
express the DeltaNp63 isoforms. We suggest p63 as a reliable, highly specific,
and sensitive MC marker in both histologic and cytologic preparations.
Furthermore, because p63 immunoreactivity in adult epithelia is normally
restricted to progenitor cells, it can be speculated that it might be a clue for 
the identification of the still elusive breast progenitor cells.

The human p53 protein family comprises three members - p53, p63 and p73. Whereas 
only one p53 variant is known multiple isoforms of p63 and p73 have been
described. Depending on the isoform p63 influences p53-responsive genes in a
p53-like or -distinct manner. We have cloned multiple splice variants of
keratinocyte transcription factor (KET), the rat ortholog of human p63. Several
tissue specific variations of exon 1 resulting in different amino-terminal ends
were identified. Transactivation properties of the splice variants inversely
correlated with the length of the N-termini as determined by activation of the
p53-responsive p21 promotor. Multiple KET isoforms are colocalized in different
rat tissues. The amino-terminal truncated form DeltaNKETalpha is expressed in
epithelial tissues, while expression of the most p53-like KET isotype TAKETgamma 
was detected in skeletal muscle. Expression of a major KET variant appears to be 
a cell-type specific rather than a differentiation specific phenomenon.

p63 mutations have been associated with EEC syndrome (ectrodactyly, ectodermal
dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate), as well as with nonsyndromic split hand-split
foot malformation (SHFM). We performed p63 mutation analysis in a sample of 43
individuals and families affected with EEC syndrome, in 35 individuals affected
with SHFM, and in three families with the EEC-like condition limb-mammary
syndrome (LMS), which is characterized by ectrodactyly, cleft palate, and
mammary-gland abnormalities. The results differed for these three conditions. p63
gene mutations were detected in almost all (40/43) individuals affected with EEC 
syndrome. Apart from a frameshift mutation in exon 13, all other EEC mutations
were missense, predominantly involving codons 204, 227, 279, 280, and 304. In
contrast, p63 mutations were detected in only a small proportion (4/35) of
patients with isolated SHFM. p63 mutations in SHFM included three novel
mutations: a missense mutation (K193E), a nonsense mutation (Q634X), and a
mutation in the 3' splice site for exon 5. The fourth SHFM mutation (R280H) in
this series was also found in a patient with classical EEC syndrome, suggesting
partial overlap between the EEC and SHFM mutational spectra. The original family 
with LMS (van Bokhoven et al. 1999) had no detectable p63 mutation, although it
clearly localizes to the p63 locus in 3q27. In two other small kindreds affected 
with LMS, frameshift mutations were detected in exons 13 and 14, respectively.
The combined data show that p63 is the major gene for EEC syndrome, and that it
makes a modest contribution to SHFM. There appears to be a genotype-phenotype
correlation, in that there is a specific pattern of missense mutations in EEC
syndrome that are not generally found in SHFM or LMS.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in the regulation of the
cell cycle and apoptosis. The importance of p53's functions is underscored by the
high incidence of p53 mutations in human cancers. Recently, two p53-related
proteins, p73 and p63, were identified as members of the p53 gene family.
Multiple isoforms of p73 have been found, including DeltaN variants in which the 
N-termini are truncated. p63 is expressed as three major forms, p63alpha, p63beta
and p63gamma, each of which differ in their C-termini. All three forms can be
alternatively transcribed from a cryptic promoter located within intron 3,
producing DeltaNp63alpha, DeltaNp63beta and DeltaNp63gamma. The high degree of
similarity of p73 and p63 to evolutionarily conserved regions of p53 suggests
that these proteins play an important and potentially redundant role in
regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here we describe the characterization
of cell lines generated to inducibly express p63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha. We have
found that p63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha can differentially regulate endogenous p53
target genes and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Deletion of the
N-terminal 26 amino acids of DeltaNp63alpha abolished its ability to
transactivate p53 target genes and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This
indicates that a putative transactivation domain exists within the N-terminus of 
the DeltaN variants of p63. Furthermore, the differential regulation of p53
target genes by p63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha suggests that p63 and p53 utilize
both similar and different signaling pathways to execute their cellular
functions.

Recent studies of the p53 homologue p63 indicate that this gene is preferentially
expressed in basal and immature cervical squamous epithelium. This study
correlated p63 expression with morphologic phenotype and human papillomavirus
(HPV) type in a wide range of cervical neoplasms. Two hundred fifty cases of
cervical carcinoma, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA; n = 178),
adenocarcinoma (ADCA; n = 28), adenosquamous carcinoma (ASCA; n = 8),
neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECA; n = 15), and other variant or mixed types (n =
21) were studied. Ninety-seven percent of SCCA, 0% of ADCA, and 0% of SCUC showed
strong (>75% v <30%) positivity for p63 (P<.001). p63 sharply distinguished SCCA 
(p63+) from ADCA (p63-), Large-cell, poorly differentiated carcinomas were
distinguished as putative glandular (glassy cell) or squamous
(lymphoepithelial-like or spindle cell) types based on p63 staining. Eight (73%) 
of 11 neuroendocrine tumors tested were chromogranin positive; all showed no or
low (<30%) levels of p63 immunostaining. Absence of p63 was also associated with 
a subset of nonneuroendocrine undifferentiated carcinomas. Transitions from
squamous to columnar or undifferentiated morphology coincided with loss of p63
expression. A strong association between HPV 16 and p63 positivity was identified
because of the colocalization of both within tumors of squamous phenotype. p63 is
a powerful marker for squamous differentiation and, when diffusely expressed,
excludes a glandular or neuroendocrine differentiation. p63 may be useful for
differentiating pure squamous or glandular from adenosquamous carcinomas,
tracking shifts in differentiation within tumors, supporting (by its absence) the
diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinomas, and clarifying the spectrum of poorly
differentiated carcinomas lacking either squamous or neuroendocrine
differentiation.

The significance of p53, a prominent tumor suppressor gene, and its product in
various neoplasms including pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been established. We
investigated the expression of two types of homologue of p53, p73 and p63, in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma by means of immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of p73
was observed in 45.6% of the cases and this phenomenon was more frequently seen
in cystic adenocarcinomas than in ductal carcinomas. Furthermore, p73
overexpression was inversely linked to lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and
Ki-67 labeling index. On the other hand, p63 overexpression was observed in 68.2%
of the cases, but was not related to any clinicopathological features. No
correlation was established between the expression of these proteins and aberrant
p53 expression. These results suggest that decreased expression of p73 protein
and over-expression of p63 protein may play a role in the development of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

activity.

Under normal conditions, tumor suppressor protein p53 exists in the cell in its
latent form and is unable to function as a transcription factor. The allosteric
model of p53 regulation postulates that the extreme portion of p53 carboxyl
terminus (aa 364-393) binds to the core domain of the protein, thereby abrogating
specific DNA binding in that region. In this study we propose an alternative
mechanism of p53 functional regulation, which involves a separate molecule acting
in trans to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity. Through the use of chimeric
proteins of p53, p63gamma and p73beta, we show that the extreme COOH-terminal
domain of p53 exerts a powerful and specific inhibitory effect on the p73- and
p63-driven expression of a reporter gene. Moreover, fusion of p53 extreme COOH
terminus to a completely unrelated transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 also
results in significant inhibition of transactivation activity. Since p73, p63, or
Gal4-VP16 cannot associate with any part of the p53 molecule, we conclude that
p53(aa 364-393) represses transcriptional activity of chimeric proteins and p53
itself through the binding of external negative modulator(s) in that region and
not by the allosteric mechanism of regulation. In accordance with the "distinct
inhibitor" hypothesis, the activity of wild type p53 is substantially increased
by overexpression of chimeric proteins bearing p53(aa 364-393), which might be
due to the competitive removal of transcriptional inhibitor(s). Our findings
provide the basis for the identification of such negative modulators of p53
transcriptional activity.

A simple specific pattern of chromosomal aberrations at early stages of head and

Low-grade head and neck squamous cell carcinomas without lymph node involvement
or distant metastasis (N(0)M(0)) were screened for chromosomal imbalances by
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). pT(1-2) tumors contain a low number of
aberrations (average number, 4.3; 15 cases), in contrast to pT(3) tumors (average
number, 11.8; 6 cases), and exhibit a specific CGH pattern, affecting three
chromosomes: partial or total 3q gain and/or 3p loss (73% of cases), 8q gain
(47%), and 11q13 gain (27%). Thus, these changes represent early events in the
pathogenesis of low-grade tumors. Cytogenetic exploration of chromosome 3
aberrations in head and neck cell lines suggests that the formation of an
isochromosome 3q is one intermediate mechanism leading to 3p losses and/or 3q
gains. On the long arm of chromosome 3, most of tumors exhibit low-level gains of
large segments, involving systematically the 3q26-qter area, but with two
alternative smallest region overlaps at 3q26 and 3q28-qter. We decided to refine 
the mapping of 3q26-qter gains by using fluorescence in situ hybridization on
tumor nuclei, with clones containing two outstanding positional and functional
candidate genes, PIK3CA and p63, located respectively at 3q26 and at 3q28.
Although PIK3CA or p63 were preferentially gained in few cases (4 of 45), both
genes were over-represented in 27 of 45 low-grade N(0)M(0) carcinomas analyzed by
CGH or fluorescence in situ hybridization. To evaluate the relative contribution 
of PIK3CA and p63 in the pathogenesis of head and neck carcinomas displaying a 3q
gain, we measured their respective transcription levels in tumors with previously
determined gene copy number. DNp63, the predominant p63 transcript, is
overexpressed in tumors compared with normal tissues, but its expression level is
independent to gene copy number. In contrast, a significant PIK3CA overexpression
is associated with increased gene dosage. These results indicate that PIK3CA,
contrary to DNp63, may participate to the progression of head and neck tumors
consequent to a low-level 3q over-representation. Interestingly, survival
analysis using CGH suggested, in accordance with previous data, that 3q26 gain,
the locus of PIK3CA, could predict clinical outcome for early disease tumors.
This prompts us to pursue 3q26 (or PIK3CA) prognostic evaluation in a larger
population of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.

The amino terminal of human P51/TAp63, a P53 homologue, possesses a
transactivation domain involved in the activation of its target genes by binding 
to DNA elements responsive to the p53 protein family. Using a series of amino
terminal deletions, the transactivation domain was mapped between amino acid
residues 50 to 69. This domain also regulates protein stability in a
proteasome-dependent manner, and Ser51 and Ser68 were found to be essential for
this stability. Our results suggest that P51 activity is greatly affected by
protein stability.

The p63 gene has high homology with p53, but more complex physiologic functions, 
including the regulation of the maintenance of basal cells in stratified
epithelia. These cells in fact express high levels of the deltaN-terminal
truncated isoforms of the p63 gene that can act as dominant-negative inhibiting
the activity of p53. Basal cells in human bronchi and bronchioli seem to use the 
same strategy, since they constitutively express high levels of p63, at variance 
with alveolar pneumocytes. Over-expression of these isoforms in airway basal
cells can inhibit important functions of the p53-pathway, including cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis. This finding underlines the key role of p63 in epithelial
renewal in human lung, with important implications in the understanding of the
mechanisms of tissue remodelling occurring in diffuse lung diseases.

BACKGROUND: p73 and p51 are genes possessing amino-acid similarities to p53. We
previously found no mutation in p73 in prostatic carcinoma, but did find abnormal
expression of the gene. Involvement of these genes in prostatic carcinogenesis is
still poorly understood.
METHODS: Mutation analysis of the p51 gene and allelotyping of 3q28, on which p51
lies, were performed. Expression of p53, p73, and p51 was examined using reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and expression levels were compared.
RESULTS: No mutation in p51 was found (0/55 cases). Loss of heterozygosity at
3q28 was detected in 6 of 28 cases (21.8%). By expression analysis we found that 
in p53, 4 of 38 cases (10.5%) showed downregulation. No cases showed upregulation
of p53. In contrast, p73 and p51 were downregulated in 42.1 and 39.5% of cases,
respectively, and upregulated in 31.5 and 34.2% of cases, respectively.
Expression levels of p51 corresponded with those of p73 in 25 of 38 cases
(65.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Somatic mutations in p73 and p51 are not important in prostatic
carcinogenesis. These genes may be associated with tumors by expression levels
and may have roles in addition to tumor suppression.

Transcriptional dysregulation of the p73L / p63 / p51 / p40 / KET gene in human

We have recently identified a second p53 -related p73L gene, also referred to as 
p63 / p51 / p40 / KET gene, which encodes the 2 major isoforms p73L and p51
resulting from different exon usage at their amino terminal regions. Although
p73L and p51 are suspected to play oncogenic and tumour suppressive roles in
mammalian cells, respectively, no evidence of linkage between the expression of
these isoforms and human cancers has been reported so far. In this study, we
first investigated the expression profile of p51 and p73L in various human tumour
cell lines and found that a novel isoform, termed DeltaNp73L, was predominantly
expressed in squamous cell carcinomas. The expression profile of
DeltaNp73L/p73L/p51 in primary human skin cancer specimens showed that the
expression of p51 was frequently lost (62%) but was detected in all normal skin
samples. In p51-expressing skin cancers, DeltaNp73L expression was associated at 
a high frequency (75%) though it was not detected in normal skin tissues.
Transient co-transfection data indicate the possibility that DeltaNp73L can
inhibit p53-, and more preferentially, p51-mediated transactivation. These data
suggest that the loss of expression of p51 and/or the expression of DeltaNp73L
might contribute to the pathogenesis of human squamous cell carcinomas.

We examined AIS status in digestive tract cancers and found that all eight
esophageal cancer cell lines (100%) showed AIS/TA-AIS gene overexpression,
whereas 1 of 12 (8%) gastric cancer and 0 of 14 (0%) colon cancer cell lines
showed AIS/TA-AIS gene expression. We then confirmed that the AIS gene, not the
TA-AIS gene, was dominantly expressed in esophageal cancers by reverse
transcription-PCR. AIS protein was also expressed in AIS gene-positive cell
lines. Subsequently, we tested AIS gene expression in paired esophageal normal
tissues and cancers. Twenty-five of 39 (64%) primary esophageal cancers
demonstrated an obviously higher expression of AIS gene compared to paired normal
tissues. Moreover, high AIS gene expression was significantly associated with
lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer (P = 0.0271). These results suggested 
that AIS may be useful as a marker for advanced esophageal cancer.

Inactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 is the most common defect in cancer
cells. The discovery of its two close relatives, p63 and p73, was therefore both 
provocative and confounding. Were these new genes tumour suppressors, p53
regulators, or evolutionary spin-offs? Both oncogenic and tumour-suppressor
properties have now been attributed to the p53 homologues, perhaps reflecting the
complex, often contradictory, protein products encoded by these genes. p63 and
p73 are further implicated in many p53-independent pathways, including stem-cell 
regeneration, neurogenesis and sensory processes.

The proliferative compartment of stratified squamous epithelia consists of stem
and transient amplifying (TA) keratinocytes. Some polypeptides are more abundant 
in putative epidermal stem cells than in TA cells, but no polypeptide confined to
the stem cells has yet been identified. Here we show that the p63 transcription
factor, a p53 homologue essential for regenerative proliferation in epithelial
development, distinguishes human keratinocyte stem cells from their TA progeny.
Within the cornea, nuclear p63 is expressed by the basal cells of the limbal
epithelium, but not by TA cells covering the corneal surface. Human keratinocyte 
stem and TA cells when isolated in culture give rise to holoclones and
paraclones, respectively. We show by clonal analysis that p63 is abundantly
expressed by epidermal and limbal holoclones, but is undetectable in paraclones. 
TA keratinocytes, immediately after their withdrawal from the stem cell
compartment (meroclones), have greatly reduced p63, even though they possess very
appreciable proliferative capacity. Clonal evolution (i.e., generation of TA
cells from precursor stem cells) is promoted by the sigma isoform of the 14-3-3
family of proteins. Keratinocytes whose 14-3-3final sigma has been down-regulated
remain in the stem cell compartment and maintain p63 during serial cultivation.
The identification of p63 as a keratinocyte stem cell marker will be of practical
importance for the clinical application of epithelial cultures in cell therapy as
well as for studies on epithelial tumorigenesis.

p51 in the p53 tumor suppressor family, also referred to as p63, encodes multiple
isoforms including p51A (TAp63gamma) and p51B (TAp63alpha). The p53 protein forms
a tetramer, and its stability and activity are regulated by molecular association
with viral and cellular proteins and by biochemical modifications. Using a yeast 
two-hybrid system, the p51A and p51B isoforms were examined for homotypic and
heterotypic interactions in the p53 family proteins and for their affinity to the
p53-regulatory factors. Results indicate a homotypic interaction dependent on the
presumed oligomerization domain of the p51 proteins. The possibility of a weak
heterotypic interaction between p51 and p73 proteins was suggested, while
association between p51 and p53 appeared improbable. Furthermore, unlike p53, the
p51 proteins failed to display an affinity to SV40 large T antigen or MDM2-family
proteins. Having several features in common with p53, the p51 proteins may
function in biological processes apart from p53.

The p53 protein is related by sequence homology and function to the products of
two other genes, p63 and p73, that each encode several isoforms. We and others
have discovered previously that certain tumor-derived mutants of p53 can
associate and inhibit transcriptional activation by the alpha and beta isoforms
of p73. In this study we have extended these observations to show that in
transfected cells a number of mutant p53 proteins could bind and down-regulate
several isoforms not only of p73 (p73 alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta) but also 
of p63 (p63 alpha and -gamma; Delta Np63 alpha and -gamma). Moreover, a
correlation existed between the efficiency of p53 binding and the inhibition of
p63 or p73 function. We also found that wild-type p63 and p73 interact
efficiently with each other when coexpressed in mammalian cells. The interaction 
between p53 mutants and p63 or p73 was confirmed in a physiological setting by
examining tumor cell lines that endogenously express these proteins. We also
demonstrated that purified p53 and p73 proteins interact directly and that the
p53 core domain, but not the tetramerization domain, mediates this interaction.
Using a monoclonal antibody (PAb240) that recognizes an epitope within the core
domain of a subset of p53 mutants, we found a correlation between the ability of 
p53 proteins to be immunoprecipitated by this antibody and their ability to
interact with p73 or p63 in vitro and in transfected cells. Based on these
results and those of others, we propose that interactions between the members of 
the p53 family are likely to be widespread and may account in some cases for the 
ability of tumor-derived p53 mutants to promote tumorigenesis.

Members of the p53 family of transcription factors have essential roles in tumor 
suppression and in development. MDM2 is an essential regulator of p53 that can
inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53, shuttle p53 out of the nucleus, and 
target p53 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Little is known about the
interaction and selectivity of different members of the p53 family (p53, p63, and
p73) and the MDM2 family (MDM2 and MDMX). Here we show that the transcriptional
activities of p53 and p73, but not that of p63, were inhibited by both MDM2 and
MDMX. Consistent with these, we found that MDMX can physically interact with p53 
and p73, but not with p63. Moreover, ectopically expressed MDM2 and MDMX could
induce alterations in the subcellular localization of p73, but did not affect the
subcellular localization of p53 and p63. Finally, we demonstrate that while ARF
can interact with MDM2 and inhibit the regulation of p53 by MDM2, no interaction 
was found between ARF and MDMX. These data reveal that significant differences
and selectivity exist between the regulation of different members of the p53
family by MDM2 and MDMX.

Most genes are members of a family. It is generally believed that a gene family
derives from an ancestral gene by duplication and divergence. The tumor
suppressor p53 was a striking exception to this established rule. However, two
new p53 homologs, p63 and p73, have recently been described [1-6]. At the
sequence level, p63 and p73 are more similar to each other than each is to p53,
suggesting the possibility that the ancestral gene is a gene resembling p63/p73, 
while p53 is phylogenetically younger [1,2].The complexity of the family has also
been enriched by the alternatively spliced forms of p63 and p73, which give rise 
to a complex network of proteins involved in the control of cell proliferation,
apoptosis and development [1,2,4,7-9]. In this review we will mainly focus on
similarities and differences as well as relationships among p63, p73 and p53.

Even though the tumor suppressor gene p53 is highly important in human cancer, as
indicated by the fact that it is mutated in about 50% of cases, up to a few years
ago no similar proteins had been identified. Recently, two p53 homologues have
been identified, p73 and p63, with high amino acid identity suggesting similar
functions. Indeed, like p53, p73 as well (i) can bind mdmX, mdm2, p300/CAF and
adenovirus E4-orf6 proteins, (ii) can trigger several promoters including p21,
bax, mdm2, gadd45, cyclin G, IGFBP3, 14-3-3 sigma, (iii) is able to trigger cell 
death, (iv) is involved in the DNA damage response, although through a different 
pathway. Here we analyze the data present in the literature in search of
diverging pathways among the p53, p63, p73 family. Both p63 and p73 present two
significant structural peculiarities: the presence of an extended non-conserved
C-terminus containing a sterile alpha motive (SAM), typical of developmental
proteins, and the presence of number of different splicing isoforms differing in 
the N-terminus or in the absence of the transactivation domain (delta N forms),
acting as dominant negative. The mouse knockout of p63 and p73, unlike the ones
for p53, shows developmental abnormalities; p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in
human cancers; both genes are regulated in different differentiation models. This
strongly suggests the involvement of p63 and p73 in development. A picture is
emerging showing a gradient of function among p53, p73, p63 ranging from tumor
suppression to development.

The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that upon activation by
DNA-damaging agents induces growth arrest or apoptosis mainly through
transactivation and transrepression of its downstream target genes. Two
additional p53 family members, p73 and p51/p63, were recently identified and
characterized. Although the three family members share some similarities in
transcription activation and apoptosis induction, each of them appears to play a 
distinct role in development and tumor suppression. We have previously identified
a nuclear protein, p53CP (p53 competing protein), that is not p53 but binds to
the p53 consensus sequence. Here we report the partial purification of p53CP from
HeLa cells by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by a series of
chromatography steps through heparin-agarose, Mono S ion exchange and DNA
affinity columns, coupled with a gel shift assay. Although p53CP activity is
readily detectable in HeLa cells by gel shift assay, only a trace amount of p53CP
protein was partially purified, which was not sufficient for direct protein
sequencing. Using a monoclonal antibody (4A4) specific for all p51/p63 isoforms
or a polyclonal antibody (N-18) recognizing the N-terminus-containing p51/p63
isoforms we detected a significant enrichment of p51/p63 protein in
p53CP-containing fractions following each step of purification. Significantly,
p51/p63 was detected only in the DNA affinity column fractions that contain p53CP
activity. Thus, p53CP appears to be p51/p63, the third member of the p53 gene
family.

We previously identified a non-p53, p53-responsive DNA element (p53RE)-binding
protein named NBP, functionally analogous to p53, from human cervical carcinoma
Hela cells. Here we report a biochemical study demonstrating that this activity
is the recently cloned p53 analog p63. NBP was purified through conventional and 
DNA affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity with a prominent polypeptide 
migrating in between the 43 and 68 kDa positions on a SDS gel. This polypeptide
immunoreacted with monoclonal anti-p63 but not anti-p53 or anti-p73 antibodies.
Also, NBP co-purified with p63 through each step of fractionation, as detected
with anti-p63 antibodies. DNA-protein complexes formed with purified NBP and
p53RE-containing oligomers derived from the p21(waf1) promoter were supershifted 
by anti-p63 but not anti-p53 antibodies. Thus, these results demonstrate that NBP
is encoded by the p53 homolog p63 gene.

The p51 gene encodes a protein with significant homology to p53, thus, it is a
candidate tumor suppressor gene. To investigate the involvement of the p51 gene
in human ovarian carcinogenesis, p51 gene alterations were examined in primary
ovarian cancers and ovarian cancer cell lines. Mutation analysis of the p51 gene 
was performed in 40 primary ovarian cancers and 6 ovarian cancer cell lines using
the PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing methods. Expression of p51 mRNA was examined
in 9 primary ovarian cancers and 5 ovarian cancer cell lines by Northern blot and
RT-PCR analyses. No mutations of the p51 gene causing amino acid substitutions or
frameshifts were detected in either primary tumors or cancer cell lines by
PCR-SSCP analysis of the entire coding region, although several genetic
polymorphisms were detected in three samples. Allelic imbalance was detected in 3
of 19 (16%) primary ovarian cancers. No p51 gene expression was detected in 9
primary ovarian cancers and the corresponding normal ovarian tissues by Northern 
blot and by RT-PCR analyses. One of 5 ovarian cancer cell lines showed p51 gene
expression by Northern blot analysis (20%). These results indicated that p51 gene
expression was silent in normal ovarian tissues and primary ovarian cancers, and 
that mutation of the p51 gene does not play a major role in the development of
ovarian cancer.

Two homologs of the p53 tumor suppressor, p63 and p73 have recently been
discovered. These proteins have activities similar to p53 in cell culture but
have distinct developmental functions in vivo. We found that
temperature-sensitive mutants of certain p63 and p73 isoforms can be created by
single amino acid substitutions of an alanine residue corresponding to alanine
135 of murine p53. The mutants (p63gamma-Pro167, p73alpha-Leu156 and
p73beta-Ile156) can be controlled by temperature shift between 32 degrees C and
39 degrees C. They can be stably expressed in p53-null H1299 cells at 39 degrees 
C, become transcriptionally activated at 32 degrees C, and induce expression of
p53-responsive genes MDM2 and p21WAF1. Activation of p73beta-Ile156 in H1299
cells inhibits cell division but induces significant increase in cell size
(hypertrophy), whereas activation of p73alpha-Leu156 and p63gamma-Pro167 induces 
apoptosis. These mutants may be useful tools for gaining further insight to the
functions of p53 homologs.

Hay-Wells syndrome, also known as ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting
(AEC) syndrome (OMIM 106260), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized
by congenital ectodermal dysplasia, including alopecia, scalp infections,
dystrophic nails, hypodontia, ankyloblepharon and cleft lip and/or cleft palate. 
This constellation of clinical signs is unique, but some overlap can be
recognized with other ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, for example
ectrodactyly--ectodermal dysplasia--cleft lip/palate (EEC; OMIM 604292),
limb--mammary syndrome (LMS; OMIM 603543), acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth
syndrome (ADULT; OMIM 103285) and recessive cleft lip/palate--ectodermal
dysplasia (CLPED1; OMIM 225060). We have recently demonstrated that heterozygous 
mutations in the p63 gene are the major cause of EEC syndrome. Linkage studies
suggest that the related LMS and ADULT syndromes are also caused by mutations in 
the p63 gene. Thus, it appears that p63 gene mutations have highly pleiotropic
effects. We have analysed p63 in AEC syndrome patients and identified missense
mutations in eight families. All mutations give rise to amino acid substitutions 
in the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, and are predicted to affect
protein--protein interactions. In contrast, the vast majority of the mutations
found in EEC syndrome are amino acid substitutions in the DNA-binding domain.
Thus, a clear genotype--phenotype correlation can be recognized for EEC and AEC
syndromes.

p53 antibodies have been found in the sera of patients with various types of
cancer. The presence of these antibodies is generally associated with p53
accumulation in the tumour that is believed to trigger this humoral response. The
recent discovery of 2 new members of the p53 family, p73 and p63, led us to study
the specificity of this immune response towards the 3 proteins. Serum samples
from 148 patients with various types of cancer were tested for antibodies against
p73 and p63 using immunoprecipitation. 72 patients were previously shown to have 
p53 antibodies whereas 76 were negative. The control group consisted of 50 blood 
donors. p73 were detected in 22/148 (14.9%) of the cancer patients (11/72 in the 
group with p53-antibodies and 11/76 in the negative group). Only two sera from
the control (4%) were positive. p63 antibodies were detected in only 4/148 (2.7%)
of the cancer patients. Epitope mappings were performed and demonstrate that p73 
antibodies are directed toward the central region of the p73 protein whereas p53 
antibodies react predominantly toward the amino- and the carboxy-terminus of p53.
Our results indicate that there is a specific immune response toward the p73
protein in cancer patients, a finding supported by an increasing number of
publications describing p73 accumulation in tumoral cells.

BACKGROUND: Metaplastic differentiation, including squamous, mucinous, and tubal 
(ciliated), is common in both benign and neoplastic endometrium, and the cell of 
origin for this pathway is poorly understood. In this study, expression of a
marker for basal and reserve cells in cervical squamous mucosa, designated p63,
was investigated in a spectrum of endometrial alterations.
METHODS: One hundred ninety different endometria from 132 patients were examined,
including fetal (6), premenarchal (3), benign cyclic (29) and noncyclic (54),
hyperplastic (14), and neoplastic (93) endometrial glandular epithelia. The
latter included conventional endometrioid carcinomas with and without mucinous,
ciliated, and squamous metaplasia, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC).
RESULTS: p63 expression was identified in basal/subcolumnar cells in the fetal
endometrium in a distribution similar to that in basal/reserve cells of the
cervix. Staining was confined to individual scattered basal and suprabasal cells 
in cycling endometrium. In polyps and postmenopausal endometria, focal clusters
of p63-positive cells were identified in inactive glands or surface epithelium.
Metaplastic (squamous or mucinous) epithelia, either alone or in conjunction with
hyperplasias or carcinomas, exhibited the most intense staining, primarily in
basal or subcolumnar cells. In some cases, immediately adjacent nonmetaplastic
columnar epithelium also stained positive. UPSCs contained only rare scattered
p63-positive cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Cells with a basal or reserve cell phenotype exist in the
endometrium during fetal life, are not conspicuous during the reproductive years,
but may emerge during shifts in differentiation. Whether these cells signify
specialized multipotential endometrial cells is not clear, but the similarity of 
these cells to basal/reserve cells of the cervix and their association with
neoplasia merit further study.

BACKGROUND: p63, a homologue of the tumor suppressor gene p53, is expressed in
embryonic, adult murine, and human basal squamous epithelium and encodes both
transactivating and dominant negative transcript isoforms. Mouse embryos
functionally deficient in p63 fail to replenish basal squamous epithelial cells, 
resulting in multiple defects that include absent genital squamous epithelium.
This study investigated the expression of p63 in the human cervical
transformation zone and early cervical neoplasia.
METHODS: Tissue localization of p63 was determined by immunohistochemistry in a
wide range of epithelia. A correlation was also made between p63 expression and
squamous basal cell (keratin 14), endocervical columnar cell (mucicarmine), and
cell-cycle specific (Ki-67) markers.
RESULTS: p63 expression by immunostaining delineated basal and parabasal cells of
maturing ectocervical squamous mucosa, squamous metaplasia in the cervix, and
basal and subcolumnar cells of the cervical transformation zone. In atrophic
epithelia immunostaining for p63 was present in all cell strata. In early
cervical neoplasia, p63 expression was inversely correlated with both squamous
cell maturation and nonsquamous differentiation in CIN. This biomarker also
identified basal cells in a subset of preinvasive cervical neoplasms with
endocervical cell differentiation that were bcl-2 and keratin 14 negative.
CONCLUSIONS: In the lower female genital tract, p63 is preferentially expressed
in immature cells of squamous lineage and is not linked to cell proliferation.
The broader range of p63 expression relevant to keratin 14 and bcl-2 indicates
that p63 may identify additional subsets of benign and neoplastic epithelial
basal cells in the cervical transformation zone and may be useful in studying
cell differentiation in the early stages of neoplastic change in this region.

The p53 homologue p63 encodes for different isotypes able to either transactivate
p53 reporter genes (TAp63) or act as p53-dominant-negatives (DeltaNp63). p63 is
expressed in the basal cells of many epithelial organs and its germline
inactivation in the mouse results in agenesis of organs such as skin appendages
and the breast. Here, we show that prostate basal cells, but not secretory or
neuroendocrine cells, express p63. In addition, prostate basal cells in culture
predominantly express the DeltaNp63alpha isotype. In contrast, p63 protein is not
detected in human prostate adenocarcinomas. Finally, and most importantly,
p63(-/-) mice do not develop the prostate. These results indicate that p63 is
required for prostate development and support the hypothesis that basal cells
represent and/or include prostate stem cells. Furthermore, our results show that 
p63 immunohistochemistry may be a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis of 
benign versus malignant prostatic lesions.

Despite intense research, the 5-year survival rate for patients with squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is still low. Several different
factors have been studied in the search for one or more factors that give
important prognostic information at the time of diagnosis. Many recent studies
have focused on the TP53 tumour suppressor gene, analysing its gene status and
protein status. When looking at p53 protein expression, using
immunohistochemistry, no correlation to patient outcome has been seen for the
whole group of SCCHN. However, a significant association between p53 expression
and poor patient outcome was found when looking only at patients with laryngeal
squamous cell carcinomas. Also, in oral premalignant lesions, expression of
p53-positive cells in the suprabasal layers of the epithelium has been seen as an
indication of impending malignant development. Concerning the prognostic
significance of mutations in the TP53 gene, results differ. But when restricting 
analysis to tumours with mutations causing an obvious change in protein, TP53
mutation was found to be a strong and independent variable for prognosticating
survival. This review article gives an up-to-date overview of the p53 molecule
and evaluates its possible prognostic role in SCCHN. Today it is clear that the
p53 pathway is very important in SCCHN biology and potentially in its treatment. 
The function and importance of a few other cell cycle proteins connected to p53
are also discussed.

A newly identified gene, p51, is a functional and structural homologue of the p53
gene and thus a Candidate tumor suppressor gene. To elucidate the role of the p51
gene in lung carcinogenesis, we determined the sequences of exon-intron
boundaries and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of all the 15 coding exons and
performed a mutation analysis, as well as detailed analysis for gene expression. 
A frameshift mutation was detected in 1 of 44 lung cancer cell lines, whereas no 
mutation was detected in 45 primary lung cancers. Thus, p51 mutation occurs only 
in a small subset of lung cancer. Expression of the p51 gene was detected in 23
of 43 cell lines by Northern blot analysis and 34 of 44 by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Thus, p51 expression
is low or absent in a subset of lung cancer. The deltaN isotype of p51
transcripts was dominantly expressed in several cell lines, particularly in cell 
lines with high levels of p51 expression. Because the deltaN isotype encodes a
protein that transdominantly suppresses the transactivation function of the TA
type of p51, it is possible that p51 protein is not functionally active, even in 
lung cancer cells with p51 mRNA expression, due to expression of
dominant-negative p51 protein. These results suggested that the p51 gene is
inactive in a considerable proportion of lung cancers. RT-PCR analysis also
revealed the presence of a novel type of mRNA transcript, p51delta, which lacks
exons 12 and 13 by alternative splicing. The delta isotype was expressed in 18 of
44 lung cancer cell lines and in diverse normal tissues. Further analysis on p51 
expression in cancerous as well as noncancerous cells will provide us with
valuable information for the understanding of multiple functions of the p53
family proteins in human carcinogenesis.

Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy that 
is consistently associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) but which very rarely
has p53 gene mutations in primary tumours. Since the tumour suppressor p53 is
mutated in most human cancers or the wild type protein is inactivated in a
significant number of the remainder, here we have investigated cellular factors
that could compromise p53 function in primary NPC. Twenty-five primary tumours
were judged to carry only wild type p53 by SSCP analysis of all exons and
sequence determination of exons 4-9. Only one tumour was found to express
significant levels of hMdm2 and in 24/25 there were no detectable mutations or
deletions in exons 1beta and 2 of the p14(ARF) gene. However,
immunohistochemistry consistently revealed that all the tumour cells express
substantial amounts of the p53-related protein p63. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
analysis of mRNA from tumour biopsies showed that the dominant species expressed 
was invariably the truncated deltaN-isotype. Since this can block p53-mediated
transactivation, it is potentially a dominant-negative isoform. In normal
nasopharyngeal epithelium the distribution of p63 was restricted to the
proliferating basal and suprabasal layers. We suggest that deltaN-p63 is a good
candidate as a suppressor of wild type p53 function in these tumours and also
that it may prove to be a valuable diagnostic marker for undifferentiated NPC.

p63, a recently identified member of the p53 gene family, encodes multiple
products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities. 
To explore the penetrance of p63 in bladder carcinogenesis, we performed
expression and mutation analyses of two major isotypes, TAp63 and deltaNp63, in
63 bladder specimens. In 12 normal tissues, TAp63 was expressed at an easily
detectable level whereas deltaNp63 was absent or extremely low. While none of 47 
carcinomas showed allelic deletion of the gene, marked reduction of TAp63 and
abnormal overexpression of deltaNp63 were found in 25 (53.2%) and 30 (63.8%)
carcinomas, respectively. Tumor-specific alteration of TAp63 and deltaNp63
expression was identified in two and three of six matched sets, respectively. In 
addition, reduced expression of TAp63 showed a correlation with tumor stage and
grade. Abnormal expression of TAp63 or deltaNp63 isoform was also observed in
three of four cell lines, and treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine led to up- or
down-regulation of TAp63 and/or deltaNp63 expression, suggesting that the
promoters of both isoforms might be affected by DNA methylation, but not in a
reciprocal fashion. No sequence alteration of p63 was identified in 47 carcinomas
whereas 17 (34.8%) of these showed p53 mutations, and no association between p63 
expression and the mutational status of p53 or expression of p21Waf1, MDM2, and
14-3-3sigma was recognized. Our data suggest that altered expression of p63 is a 
frequent event in bladder carcinogenesis and might contribute to the progression 
of bladder tumors, possibly via the mechanism(s) distinct from the p53 pathway.

The p53 homologue p63 is essential for ectodermal differentiation, such that
p63-/- mice lack all squamous epithelia and teeth. The p63 gene expresses at
least 6 different transcripts, but information regarding the expression,
regulation and function of the different isoforms has remained sparse, due to the
lack of adequate reagents directed specifically against the individual proteins. 
Here we characterize the expression of p63 alpha/delta Np63 alpha in benign and
malignant lesions of the oral epithelium, using a specific antibody raised
against a peptide derived from the C-terminus of p63 alpha, which does not
cross-react with p53 or the other p53 homologue, p73. By immunohistochemical
analysis, we show that these p63 isoforms are expressed in the nucleus of many
cells. In normal and benign lesions, p63 alpha/delta Np63 alpha-expressing cells 
are mainly found suprabasally, whereas p53-expressing cells are restricted to the
basal-cell layer. By RT-PCR, we show that delta Np63 alpha is the predominant
isoform in cell lines from squamous-cell carcinomas of the head and neck,
confirming our immunochemical observations. Our data are consistent with studies 
suggesting a role for p63 in the transit-amplifying population of epidermal
cells. Over-expression of p63 alpha, and in particular the delta N form, was
frequently seen in carcinomas. Taken together with previous analyses of p63
expression, our data suggest distinct roles for different p63 isoforms in the
regulation of growth and/or differentiation of epithelial cells. Moreover, our
data are compatible with the notion that p63 can act to promote neoplastic growth
in the oral epithelium.

p53 and its two homologues, p73 and p63, share considerable structural
similarities, an ability to interact between themselves and to transactivate the 
same promoters, including for example p21. Furthermore, p73 can induce cell death
via its interaction with c-Abl. In contrast, p63 has been demonstrated to be
essential for limb and skin formation. We evaluated the expression of p63 and p73
in differentiating human keratinocytes in vitro. Skin biopsy and primary cultures
of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) express both p73 and p63. NHEK
induced to differentiate in vitro by high calcium exposure show induction of p73 
delta and downregulation of all isoforms of p63. This latter gene is
predominantly expressed in its transcriptionally inactive form, DeltaNp63. We
further evaluated the effect of either p73s or p63 transfected in either NHEK or 
transformed human keratinocytes (HaCat cells). p73 gamma, delta, and p63 were
able to transactivate the promoters of loricrin and involucrin in both NHEK and
HaCat cells. These results suggest the involvement of both p73 and p63 genes in
keratinocyte terminal differentiation.

p51A, or TAp63gamma, a translation product of gene p51, or p63, was identified as
a homolog of p53 in its primary structure and transactivating function. p53 plays
a decision-making role in inducing either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in
response to DNA damage, and thereby preserves genome integrity of living cells.
To compare the biological activities between p51A and p53, cell lines with
low-level, constitutive expression of each protein were obtained by cDNA
transfection of mouse erythroleukemic cells. Production of p51A with an apparent 
molecular mass of 57-kilodalton (kD) accompanied induction of p21waf1 and
appearance of hemoglobin-producing cells. After DNA-damaging treatment either
with ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation or with actinomycin D, the p51A protein
accumulated in time courses corresponding to those of wild-type p53, and caused
an increase in the hemoglobin-positive cell count. In contrast, p53-accumulated
cells underwent apoptosis without exhibiting the feature of erythroid
differentiation. The mode of p21waf1 and Bax-alpha upregulations varied between
p51A- and p53-expressing cells and between the types of DNA damage. These results
suggest the possibility that p51A induces differentiation under genotoxic
circumstances. There may be cellular factors that control p51A protein stability 
and transactivating ability.

Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), a limb malformation involving the
central rays of the autopod and presenting with syndactyly, median clefts of the 
hands and feet, and aplasia and/or hypoplasia of the phalanges, metacarpals, and 
metatarsals, is phenotypically analogous to the naturally occurring murine
Dactylaplasia mutant (Dac). Results of recent studies have shown that, in
heterozygous Dac embryos, the central segment of the apical ectodermal ridge
(AER) degenerates, leaving the anterior and posterior segments intact; this
finding suggests that localized failure of ridge maintenance activity is the
fundamental developmental defect in Dac and, by inference, in SHFM. Results of
gene-targeting studies have demonstrated that p63, a homologue of the cell-cycle 
regulator TP53, plays a critically important role in regulation of the formation 
and differentiation of the AER. Two missense mutations, 724A-->G, which predicts 
amino acid substitution K194E, and 982T-->C, which predicts amino acid
substitution R280C, were identified in exons 5 and 7, respectively, of the p63
gene in two families with SHFM. Two additional mutations (279R-->H and 304R-->Q) 
were identified in families with EEC (ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and
facial cleft) syndrome. All four mutations are found in exons that fall within
the DNA-binding domain of p63. The two amino acids mutated in the families with
SHFM appear to be primarily involved in maintenance of the overall structure of
the domain, in contrast to the p63 mutations responsible for EEC syndrome, which 
reside in amino acid residues that directly interact with the DNA.

We and others recently isolated a human p53 homologue (p40/p51/p63/p73L) and
localized the gene to the distal long arm of chromosome 3. Here we sought to
examine the role of p40/p73L, two variants lacking the N-terminal transactivation
domain, in cancer. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed
frequent amplification of this gene locus in primary squamous cell carcinoma of
the lung and head and neck cancer cell lines. (We named this locus AIS for
amplified in squamous cell carcinoma.) Furthermore, amplification of the AIS
locus was accompanied by RNA and protein overexpression of a variant p68(AIS)
lacking the terminal transactivation domain. Protein overexpression in primary
lung tumors was limited to squamous cell carcinoma and tumors known to harbor a
high frequency of p53 mutations. Overexpression of p40(AIS) in Rat 1a cells led
to an increase in soft agar growth and tumor size in mice. Our results support
the idea that AIS plays an oncogenic role in human cancer.

We have identified a new human p53 homologue, p40 (p51/p63). This gene was mapped
to the distal arm of 3q and was found to be essential for normal epithelial
development. We used microsatellite and FISH analyses to search for genetic
alterations of p40 in primary HNSCC. A more precise localization of p40 was
completed using 6 known markers on 3q and a newly isolated microsatellite marker 
within the p40 gene. We also determined the genomic organization of the p40 gene 
using human YAC and BAC clones. Microsatellite analysis revealed that 14 of 26
(54%) primary HNSCC had allelic imbalance in at least 1 of the 7 microsatellite
loci. However, FISH analysis with a p40 probe showed that a majority of HNSCC had
an increased copy number of the locus regardless of allelic status. Thus,
overrepresentation of the p40 locus may play an important role in the development
of HNSCC.

The p53/p63/p73 family of transcription factors: overlapping and distinct
functions.

The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. The
identification of two homologues, p63 and p73, revealed that p53 is a member of a
family of related transcription factors. Given that they share amino acid
sequence identity reaching 63% in the DNA-binding domain, p53, p63 and p73 should
have redundant functions in the regulation of gene expression. Indeed, p73 can
activate p53-regulated genes and suppress growth or induce apoptosis. Moreover,
p53 and p73 are both induced by DNA damage - albeit through distinct mechanisms. 
Other evidence, however, suggests that p63 and p73 are important for regulation
of normal development. An extended C-terminal region, not found in p53, is
alternatively spliced in p63 and p73. Within this C-terminal extension is a
sterile &agr; motif (SAM) previously found in other proteins that regulate
development. The p63-deficient mice showed developmental abnormalities.
Interestingly, the human p63 gene is mutated in children who have the disease
Ectrodactyly, Ectodermal dysplasia and facial Clefts (EEC) syndrome, and the
disease phenotype is similar to the one of p63-deficient mice. The p63 and p73
genes are rarely mutated in human cancer, although p73 loss is observed in
neuroblastoma and a subtype of T-cell lymphoma. p53, p63 and p73 appear to have
overlapping and distinct functions: p53 regulates the stress response to suppress
tumors; p63 is essential for ectoderm development; and p73 might regulate both
the stress response and development. Because p53 and p73 are linked to different 
upstream pathways, this family of transcription factors might regulate a common
set of genes in response to different extracellular signals and developmental
cues.

Two p53-related genes, p73 and p51, were recently identified as structural
homologues of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, suggesting that the roles of these
two genes may be similar to those of p53, including growth suppression and
induction of apoptosis. Here we show that introduction of p73 or p51 cDNAs into
cultured human cancer cells suppressed colony formation in the presence of G418. 
We then examined the ability of various isoforms of p73 and p51 to activate
transcription of a reporter gene. This assay showed that p73beta and p51A
activated transcription through a consensus p53 binding sequence, while p73alpha 
and p51B isoforms minimally transactivated the p53 reporter gene. To characterize
further the biological functions of the p53-related genes, we constructed
recombinant adenoviruses containing the p73 and p51 cDNAs. Ad-p73beta and Ad-p51A
induced endogenous p21 gene expression more effectively than Ad-p73alpha and
Ad-p51B, respectively. To evaluate the mode of cell death induced by p53-related 
genes, Ad-p73 and Ad-p51 were used to infect human cancer cells. Infection of
Ad-p73beta, Ad-p51A or Ad-p51B resulted in DNA fragmentation in a subset of
cancer cell lines more efficiently than did infection of Ad-p53. We then examined
the combined effect of each p53-related gene and the E1A oncogene in the
induction of apoptosis. The E1A oncogene cooperated with p51 as well as p53 to
induce apoptosis, while p73 resulted in a weak induction of apoptosis by E1A.
Overall, apoptosis induction by p51B and p73alpha isoforms may be due to
mechanisms other than transcriptional activation of p53-target genes. Our results
suggest that p53-related genes are both similar to and different from p53 in
their pathways leading to growth suppression.

The tumour-suppressor protein p53 has recently been shown to belong to a family
that includes two structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. Although all three 
proteins share similar transcriptional functions and the ability to induce
apoptosis, each of them appears to play a distinct role in development and tumour
suppression. In order for cell division to occur, the antiproliferative
activities of these proteins must be tightly controlled, and exciting advances
have been made in our understanding of the pathways involved in regulating p53
activity.

We have previously demonstrated that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1
(HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein represses the trans-activation function of p53 tumor
suppressor protein. Recently, several proteins with sequence homology to p53 have
been identified. In this study, we demonstrated that Tax represses the
trans-activation functions of p73alpha, p73beta, and p51A, the p53-related
proteins, as well as p53. Moreover, a mutant Tax of coactivator CBP-binding site 
(K88A), which activated NF-kappaB but not CREB pathway, could not repress the p73
nor p51 trans-activation functions, indicating that CBP-binding domain of Tax is 
essential for the suppression of their functions. Using proteins of Gal4-fused
N-terminal region of p73 and p51, we showed that Tax-mediated inactivation of p73
or p51 requires for their N-terminal trans-activation domains. Furthermore, only 
the putative N-terminal trans-activation domains of them did not have enough
transcriptional activities and their adjacent regions are essential for their
full trans-activation, suggesting the existence of their second trans-activation 
subdomains. Thus, HTLV-1 Tax inactivated the p53-related proteins through their
N-terminal trans-activation domains.

The p51 gene encodes a protein with significant homology to p53. To investigate
the involvement of the p51 gene in human hepatocarcinogenesis, mutation analysis 
of the p51 gene was performed in 54 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). No
mutations causing amino acid substitutions or frameshifts were found by
polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP)
analysis of the entire coding region. The result indicated that mutation of the
p51 gene does not play a major role in the development of HCC in Japanese
patients. Further studies on p51 expression and its functions, including the
interaction with p53, are necessary to elucidate the role of the p51 gene in
human hepatocarcinogenesis.

A burgeoning family of p53-related genes have been described recently, including 
p73 and p63. Both these genes encode proteins with many similarities to p53 but
also with the potential for forming a range of related species by alternative
promoter usage and alternative splicing. In order to begin the characterization
of p63, we generated a polyclonal serum (designated SC1) that recognizes the
C-terminus of p63alpha. We have shown that this reagent recognizes p63alpha but
not p53 nor p73. By western blot analysis both p63alpha and the N-terminal
truncated form of p63alpha (DeltaNp63alpha) were found in a range of cell lines. 
Similar immunoblot analysis of tissues reveals considerable complexity with at
least four SC1-immunoreactive isoforms being identified. In immunohistological
studies SC1 immunoreactivity is widely detectable, being predominantly associated
with proliferative compartments in epithelia. However, non-proliferative
populations can also show SC1 immunostaining. No simple relationship between the 
isoforms identified by immunoblotting of tissue lysates and the tissue
immunostaining characteristics was identified. A previously unrecognized species 
intermediate in mobility between p63alpha and DeltaNp63alpha was found in several
tissues, including nerve and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Interestingly, there
is suppression of p63alpha expression in HaCat cells in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner after UV and MMS treatment. Our data provide
further information about the complexity of p63 and the SC1 serum will prove to
be a useful tool in further studies of this p53 homologue.

p73 and p63 are two recently discovered p53 homologs. Like p53, these proteins
can recognize canonical p53 DNA-binding sites and, when overproduced, can
activate p53-responsive target genes and induce apoptosis. Unlike p53, these
genes undergo complex alternative splicing which, at least in the case of p63,
yields proteins with widely divergent biological properties. In addition p73 and 
p63 are, in contrast to p53, rarely mutated in human cancer. Furthermore, p73
inactivation is not required for viral transformation. Thus, there is currently
no firm evidence that p63 and p73 should be considered tumor suppressors. The
early suggestion that monoallelic expression of p73 contributed to carcinogenesis
needs to be interpreted cautiously in light of data showing interindividual and
intraindividual variation with respect to monoallelic expression of p73 and the
finding that p73 mRNA levels are generally increased, rather than decreased, in a
host of tumors relative to normal cells.

The p51/p63 gene is a homologue of p53, the product of which acts as a
transcriptional activator by binding to p53-responsive elements in the promoter
regions of several p53 downstream genes. Recently, we identified four distinct
mutations in the p51/p63 gene after screening >200 human tumors and cell lines.
Because all of the detected p51/p63 mutations were missense mutations, the
pathogenic effect of these mutations is difficult to determine without performing
a functional analysis. In this study, we examined the transcriptional activity of
tumor-derived p51/p63 missense mutations using a yeast-based assay and compared
the data with that of artificial p51/p63 missense mutations at residues
corresponding to the positions and substituted residues of p53 mutation
"hotspots." Although most of the p51/p63 missense mutations at the p53 hotspot
residues were unable to transactivate the promoters used in this study, the
tumor-derived p51/p63 missense mutations retained their ability to transactivate 
the MDM2 and/or the BAX promoter but not the p21/WAF1 promoter. These results
suggest that the p51/p63 mutation might be involved in an unknown tumor
suppression pathway distinct from that of p53.

p63, a recently identified member of the p53 gene family, encodes multiple
products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities. 
We show that in normal human epidermis, in hair follicles, and in stratified
epidermal cultures, p63 protein is principally restricted to cells with high
proliferative potential and is absent from the cells that are undergoing terminal
differentiation. In normal human epidermis and in hair follicles, basal cells
with abundant p63 are interspersed with cells with little or no p63. Whenever p63
mRNA is present, it encodes mainly truncated, potentially dominant-negative
isotypes. In squamous cell carcinomas, the number of cells containing p63 and
their distribution depends on the degree of anaplasia. In highly differentiated
tumors, p63 is confined to a ring of basal-like cells surrounding, but at a
distance from, centers of terminal differentiation. In less differentiated
tumors, most cells contain p63 and their distribution is chaotic with respect to 
centers of terminal differentiation. p63 appears to be a valuable diagnostic
marker for anaplastic keratinocytes.

E1B 55-kilodalton oncoproteins of adenovirus types 5 and 12 inactivate and

The p53 tumor suppressor protein represents a target for viral and cellular
oncoproteins, including adenovirus gene products. Recently, it was discovered
that several proteins with structural and functional homologies to p53 exist in
human cells. Two of them were termed p51 and p73. We have shown previously that
the E1B 55-kDa protein (E1B-55 kDa) of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) binds and
inactivates p53 but not p73. Further, p53 is rapidly degraded in the presence of 
E1B-55 kDa and the E4orf6 protein of this virus. Here, it is demonstrated that
p51 does not detectably associate with E1B-55 kDa. While p53 is relocalized to
the cytoplasm by E1B-55 kDa, p51's location is unaffected. Finally, p51 retains
its full transcriptional activity in the presence of E1B-55 kDa. Apparently, p51 
does not represent a target of Ad5 E1B-55 kDa, suggesting that the functions of
p51 are distinct from p53-like tumor suppression. E1B-55 kDa from highly
oncogenic adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) was previously shown to surpass the oncogenic
activity of Ad5 E1B-55 kDa in various assay systems, raising the possibility that
Ad12 E1B-55 kDa might target a broader range of p53-like proteins. However, we
show here that Ad12 E1B-55 kDa also inhibits p53's transcriptional activity
without measurably affecting p73 or p51. Moderate inhibition of p51's
transcriptional activity was observed in the presence of the E4orf6 proteins from
Ad5 and Ad12. p53 and Ad12-E1B-55 kDa colocalize in the nucleus and also in
cytoplasmic clusters when transiently coexpressed. Finally, E1B-55 kDa and E4orf6
of Ad12 mediate rapid degradation of p53 with an efficiency comparable to that of
the Ad5 proteins in human and rodent cells. Our results suggest that E1B-55 kDa
of either virus type has similar effects on p53 but does not affect p73 and p51.

Genetic mutation of p53, which monitors DNA damage and operates cellular
checkpoints, is a major factor in the development of human malignancies. A novel 
gene p63/p73L/p51, encoding a protein with significant homology to p53 and p73,
was recently identified at 3q27-9. To investigate the penetration of p63 in
cervical carcinogenesis, mutation and transcription analyses of p63 were
performed in cervical carcinoma. A certain isotype of p63 called TAp63gamma
encodes the acidic N-terminus and possesses a short C-terminus. Using reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism
(RT-PCR-SSCP) analysis for TAp63gamma, one mutation was found in the cervical
carcinoma cell line SKG-I. However, no mutations causing amino acid substitutions
or frameshifts were found in 54 cases examined for TAp63gamma, which is thought
to be a tumor suppressor gene. While cervical carcinomas tended to yield a
positive signal in the RT-PCR reaction designed to amplify transcripts encoding
the acidic N-terminus, normal cervix and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
did not express this transcript. These data suggest that the p63 gene does not
play an essential role as a tumor suppressor gene, but expression of TAp63gamma
may be speculatively associated with tumor growth in cervical carcinogenesis.

The p51/p63/KET proteins were identified based on their strong homology to the
tumour suppressor p53 and a related set of proteins termed p73. All these protein
species were shown to activate transcription from at least some p53-responsive
promoters. To evaluate a possible role of the transcriptionally active splicing
variant p51A/p63gamma in tumour suppression, we determined whether viral
oncoproteins that inactivate p53 might also target p51A. Neither the large
T-antigen of simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) nor the E6 protein from human
papillomavirus type 18 were found to inhibit p51A-mediated transcription, whereas
they strongly suppress the activity of p53. Further, SV40 T-antigen directly
interacts with p53 but not detectably with p51A. Finally, a cytoplasmic mutant
(K128A) of SV40 T-antigen relocalizes p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but 
p51A remains in the nucleus when coexpressed with cytoplasmic T-antigen. These
results strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of these viral oncoproteins
is specific for p53 and does not measurably affect p51A. Thus, unlike p53, p51A
does not appear to be a necessary target in virus-induced cell transformation and
may not exert a role comparable to p53 in tumour suppression.

EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ectrodactyly,
ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. We have mapped the genetic defect in
several EEC syndrome families to a region of chromosome 3q27 previously
implicated in the EEC-like disorder, limb mammary syndrome (LMS). Analysis of the
p63 gene, a homolog of p53 located in the critical LMS/EEC interval, revealed
heterozygous mutations in nine unrelated EEC families. Eight mutations result in 
amino acid substitutions that are predicted to abolish the DNA binding capacity
of p63. The ninth is a frameshift mutation that affects the p63alpha, but not
p63beta and p63gamma isotypes. Transactivation studies with these mutant p63
isotypes provide a molecular explanation for the dominant character of p63
mutations in EEC syndrome.

After the identification of p73, a second homologue of the human p53 tumor
suppressor gene has been reported and named p63/p73L/p51/p40/CUSP/KET. We have
investigated the hypotheses that: (a) p63 is mutated in diverse types of human
cancers; and (b) p63 functions in the same pathway as p53 and p73 in the process 
of carcinogenesis; therefore, mutations in these three genes would be mutually
exclusive. We have analyzed the genomic structure of the p63 gene and have
performed mutational analyses on 54 human cell lines using intronic primers
flanking each exon. We have confirmed that the human p63 open reading frame
encodes the same length of protein as murine p63 that was initially reported to
be 39 amino acids longer than human p63. By mutational analysis, we have shown
that DLD1 and SKOV3 cells have either heterozygous mutations or polymorphisms in 
the putative DNA binding domain of p63. In these cell lines, p63 is biallelically
expressed. We conclude that mutations in the p63 gene are rare in human cell
lines. The fact that DLD1 is abnormal for both p63 and p53 genes suggests that
they may not be involved in the same tumor suppressor pathway.

TP53, the gene that encodes p53, is a well-defined tumor suppressor gene that is 
frequently mutated in human cancers. Recently, two proteins homologous to p53,
termed p73 and p63, were identified. Current data indicate that both p73 and p63,
like p53, can induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting that they might 
also be tumor suppressors. However, the physiological signals that can regulate
p53, for example, DNA damage, have no effect on p73, as tested in several cell
lines. Furthermore, the signaling pathways by which p73 (and possibly p63)
induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis appear to be similar to those of p53, but
also have important differences. Thus, the p53 family proteins are closely
related but might have distinct physiological functions.

Homologs of the tumor suppressor p53, called p63 and p73, have been identified.
The p63 and p73 family members possess a domain structure similar to p53, but
contain variable C-terminal extensions. We find that some of the C-terminal
extensions contain Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domains. SAM domains are protein
modules that are involved in protein-protein interactions. Consistent with this
role, the C-terminal SAM domains of the p63 and p73 may regulate function by
recruiting other protein effectors.

We recently discovered human p51, a new gene structurally and functionally
related to human p53. This gene encodes two major splicing variants, p51A and
p51B, which differ in their carboxyl-terminal structure. However, p51A shows
strong transactivation potential, while p51B has only weak potential. To clarify 
the reason for this difference, we made chimeric gene constructs expressing
fusion proteins of p53-p51A and p53-p51B, having an N-terminus of p53 and a
C-terminus of p51A or p51B, respectively. In a BAX promoter-luciferase assay
using p53-deficient SAOS-2 cells, they exhibited up to 30-fold stronger
transactivation potential than p53 and p51A themselves, suggesting that the
C-terminus of p51B does not simply serve as a repressor. We obtained similar
results with p21WAF1 promoter-reporter plasmids. These chimeras will be valuable 
tools for gene therapy.

p51, a novel family member of human p53, is a recently identified candidate tumor
suppressor gene mapped at chromosome 3q28. Like p53, p51 was found to activate
p21Waf1/Cip1 and to induce apoptosis. Since the DNA loss at 3q is reported in
several cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we screened for
mutations in p51A (TAp63gamma), an isoform of p51 with short C-terminal region,
in 80 NSCLCs as well as 85 breast cancers by RT-PCR single strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. In NSCLCs, p51 was expressed in 
most tumors at variable levels and we found three missense and one silent
mutations: Gln31His (transactivation domain) in two tumors, Ala148Pro
(DNA-binding domain) and Leu248Leu (DNA-binding domain). In the tumor with
Ala148Pro or the silent mutation, only the mutant gene appeared to be expressed. 
The modified FASAY method to test the ability of yeast expressing p51A cDNA to
grow in medium lacking histidine has revealed that Ala148Pro results in a loss of
function, while Gln31His does not. In contrast to NSCLC, no mutation was observed
in all 85 breast cancers by the similar method. Our results suggest that, because
of infrequent mutation, p51 may not be a Knudson type tumor suppressor in most
NSCLCs and breast cancers. Nevertheless, in at least a part of NSCLC, p51 may
play a certain role in carcinogenesis in a tissue-specific manner.

p51/p63 is a novel p53 homologue that has been shown to act as a transcriptional 
activator through the p53-binding sequence of the p21/WAF1 promoter and to induce
apoptosis when it is expressed transiently in a human tumor cell line. We
developed transcription assay systems for these two related genes in both
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells and used them to investigate the
functional similarities and differences of these genes. We found that p51/p63
trans-activated the previously identified p53 target genes, but the degree of the
transactivation by p51/p63 differed from that by p53. These results suggest that 
the cellular signal on p51/p63 cross-talks partially but not completely with that

Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic
alterations found in human cancers. Recent identification of two human homologues
of p53 has raised the prospect of functional interactions between family members 
via a conserved oligomerization domain. Here we report in vitro and in vivo
analysis of homo- and hetero-oligomerization of p53 and its homologues, p63 and
p73. The oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 can independently fold into
stable homotetramers, as previously observed for p53. However, the
oligomerization domain of p53 does not associate with that of either p73 or p63, 
even when p53 is in 15-fold excess. On the other hand, the oligomerization
domains of p63 and p73 are able to weakly associate with one another in vitro. In
vivo co-transfection assays of the ability of p53 and its homologues to activate 
reporter genes showed that a DNA-binding mutant of p53 was not able to act in a
dominant negative manner over wild-type p73 or p63 but that a p73 mutant could
inhibit the activity of wild-type p63. These data suggest that mutant p53 in
cancer cells will not interact with endogenous or exogenous p63 or p73 via their 
respective oligomerization domains. It also establishes that the multiple
isoforms of p63 as well as those of p73 are capable of interacting via their
common oligomerization domain.

Perturbation of p53 protein function is a common, if not universal, finding in
human cancer. Tumor suppression by p53 is due, at least in part, to its ability
to activate transcription of certain genes involved in cell cycle control and
apoptosis (programmed cell death). Two additional members of the mammalian p53
family, p73 and p51, which is also known as p40, p63, KET, or p73L, were recently
identified. Both of these proteins share substantial sequence homology with p53
and can, at least when overproduced, activate p53-responsive promoters and induce
apoptosis. Nonetheless, data on differences between these proteins and p53 are
emerging. For example, p73 is not induced by DNA damage and is not targeted for
inactivation by viral oncoproteins such as simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen,
adenovirus E1B 55K, and human papillomavirus E6. In contrast to p53, neither p73 
nor p51 appears to be frequently mutated in human cancers on the basis of the
limited studies reported to date. Finally, unlike p53, cells produce multiple p73
and p51 isoforms as a result of alternative splicing, and production of p73 and
p51 appears to be restricted to certain tissues. Additional studies are required 
to determine the role, if any, that p73 and p51 play in cell growth control and
carcinogenesis.

We describe the cloning of p63, a gene at chromosome 3q27-29 that bears strong
homology to the tumor suppressor p53 and to the related gene, p73. p63 was
detected in a variety of human and mouse tissues, including proliferating basal
cells of epithelial layers in the epidermis, cervix, urothelium, and prostate.
Unlike p53, the p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent
abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. Importantly, 
the predominant p63 isotypes in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus
corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. We demonstrate that these
truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation
by p53 and p63, and we suggest the possibility of physiological interactions
among members of the p53 family.

The p53 protein, which regulates the rate of cell division and death, is the most
frequently mutated tumor suppressor to be identified so far in human cancers.
Recently, a gene with significant homology to p53, termed p73, has been
identified in a chromosomal region that is implicated in the molecular
pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. We have cloned a second human p53-related gene,
termed p73L, which shows strong amino-acid similarity to p73. The p73L gene is
mapped to human chromosome 3q27-28 using in situ hybridization technique. p73L
encodes a protein of 586 amino acids and its putative DNA binding domain (DBD)
has high identities to those of p53 (60.6%) and to p73 (87.8%). Northern blot
analysis, which demonstrated that the expression profiles of p73L and p73 mRNAs
are distinct in some tissues, implies that p73 and p73L may have separate,
distinct roles in different tissues.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is induced by DNA damage and/or stress
stimuli, causes cells to undergo G1-arrest or apoptotic death; thus it plays an
essential role in human carcinogenesis. We have searched for p53-related genes by
using degenerate PCR, and have identified two cDNA fragments similar to but
distinct from p53: one previously reported, p73, and the other new. We cloned two
major splicing variants of the latter gene and named these p51A and p51B (a human
homologue of rat Ket). The p51A gene encodes a 448-amino-acid protein with a
molecular weight of 50.9 kDa; and p51B, a 641-amino-acid protein with a molecular
weight of 71.9 kDa. In contrast with the ubiquitous expression of p53, expression
of p51 mRNA was found in a limited number of tissues, including skeletal muscle, 
placenta, mammary gland, prostate, trachea, thymus, salivary gland, uterus, heart
and lung. In p53-deficient cells, p51A induced growth-suppression and apoptosis, 
and upregulated p21waf-1 through p53 regulatory elements. Mutations in p51 were
found in some human epidermal tumors.

We have previously identified a cell senescence-related, detergent-insoluble
cytoplasmic protein referred to as terminin, and have presented the
development-dependent modification of terminin polypeptides in rat brain. In the 
present study, we characterize biochemically and immunocytochemically terminin
expression in human hippocampus. By immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody
(mab 1.2) against terminin, we identified a 63 kDa polypeptide (Tp63) in the
detergent-insoluble fraction of human brain proteins, which can be identified by 
either one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. The 63 kDa protein in
immunoprecipitates of human hippocampus was found to share a peptide pattern with
the 60 kDa terminin (Tp60) previously found in rat brain, as demonstrated by in
situ peptide mapping, suggesting that the human 63 kDa protein is a homologue of 
the rat Tp60. By immunocytochemistry, terminin immunoreactivity was demonstrated 
throughout the neuronal layers in the human hippocampus. The pyramidal cell layer
in hippocampus proper and subiculum, as well as the granule cells in the dentate 
gyrus, gave rise to immunoreactivity for terminin. It was observed that in the
cornu Ammonis, the highest terminin immunoreactivity was present in the pyramidal
neurons of CA1. At the cellular level terminin was localized intraneuronally, as 
demonstrated by confocal microscopy of double staining with both mab 1.2 and an
anti-neurofilament antibody. Taken together, the present study establishes that
terminin is expressed in abundance in aging human CNS neurons.
