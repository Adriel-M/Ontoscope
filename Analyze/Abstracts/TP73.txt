BACKGROUND: Molecular investigation of breast tumors has permitted better
understanding about interaction of genes and pathways involved in tumor
progression.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between genes
belonging to the pathway of apoptosis with tumor response to photodynamic
therapy.
STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mammary tumors were induced in
twenty-four Spraguey-Dawley female rats by oral gavage of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)
anthracene (8mg/Kg body weight). Animals were divided into three groups: G1
(normal tissue), G2 (tumors without treatment), G3 (animals euthanized 48h after 
treatment). The photosensitizer used was a chlorin,
5,15-bis-(2-bromo-5-hydroxyphenyl) chlorin) in the dose of 8mg/kg for each
animal. Light source of diode laser at a wavelength of 660nm, fluence rate of
100mW/cm, and light dose of 100J/cm was delivery to lesions for treatment. A
sample from each animal was investigated by quantitative real time PCR using Rat 
Apoptosis RT(2) Profiler™ PCR Array platform.
RESULTS: Pro-apoptotic BAK1, CARD6, CASP8, CIDEA, CIDEB, DAPK1, TNF, TNFRSF10B,
FASLG, LOC687813, and TP73 genes showed increased expression, and CD40
anti-apoptotic gene showed decreased expression in the group who underwent PDT
(G3) in relation to G2.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that these genes are involved more directly
with cellular apoptosis induced by PDT using the Chlorin photosensitizer.

PURPOSE: CXCL3 and its receptor CXCR2 were considered to play particularly
important roles in the progression of malignancies. However, the investigations
about CXCL3/CXCR2 axis in prostate cancer have been poorly involved. Herein we
firstly reported our studies on the expression and biological roles of CXCL3 and 
CXCR2 in prostate cancer.
METHODS: Expression levels of CXCL3 and CXCR2 in prostate cancer cell lines
(PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP), immortalized prostate stromal cell line (WPMY-1) and
immortalized prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) were investigated by RT-PCR, 
ELISA and western blot, whereas expression levels of CXCL3 in a prostate tissue
microarray were detected by immunohistochemistry. Cell counting kit-8 and
transwell assays were, respectively, utilized to determine the effects of
exogenous CXCL3 on the cell proliferation and migration. We further examined
whether CXCL3 could regulate the expression of genes correlated with prostate
tumorigenesis by RT- PCR.
RESULTS: Elevated expression of CXCR2 was detected in DU145, LNCaP and RWPE-1.
Moreover, high-level CXCL3 can be secreted by PC-3 and RWPE-1, and CXCL3 protein 
expression level in tissue microarray is concordant with prostate cancer
metastasis. Exogenous CXCL3 does not contribute to proliferation, but has a
significant effect on migration of prostate cancer cells and RWPE-1. Finally, our
data showed that exogenous CXCL3 can regulate the expression of genes including
ERK, TP73, NUMB, BAX and NDRG3.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CXCL3 and its receptor CXCR2 are
overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, prostate epithelial cells and prostate
cancer tissues, which may play multiple roles in prostate cancer progression and 
metastasis.

Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a
variety of biological processes and diseases in humans, including cancer. Our
study serves as the first comprehensive analysis of lncRNA TP73-AS1 in esophageal
cancer. We utilized a lncRNA microarray to analyze the expression profile of
lncRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Our results show that lncRNA
TP73-AS1 and BDH2 levels are generally upregulated in esophageal cancer tissues
and are strongly correlated with tumor location or TNM stage in clinical samples.
LncRNA TP73-AS1 knockdown inhibited BDH2 expression in EC9706 and KYSE30 cells,
whereas BDH2 knockdown repressed esophageal cancer cell proliferation and induced
apoptosis via the caspase-3 dependent apoptotic pathway. Overexpression of BDH2
in lncRNA TP73-AS1 knockdown cells partially rescued cell proliferation rates and
suppressed apoptosis. In mouse xenografts, tumor size was reduced in lncRNA
TP73-ASI siRNA-transfected tumors, suggesting that downregulation of lncRNA
TP73-AS1 attenuated EC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, BDH2 or
lncRNA TP73-AS1 knockdown enhanced the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer
cells to 5-FU and cisplatin. Our results suggest that lncRNA TP73-AS1 may be a
novel prognostic biomarker that could serve as a potential therapeutic target for
the treatment of esophageal cancer.

The extant jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfish, are the
oldest group of vertebrates and provide an interesting genomic evolutionary pivot
point between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates. Through genome analysis of one
of these jawless vertebrates, the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), we
identified all three members of the important p53 transcription factor
family-Tp53, Tp63, and Tp73-as well as the Mdm2 and Mdm4 genes. These genes and
their products are significant cellular regulators in human cancer, and further
examination of their roles in this most distant vertebrate relative sheds light
on their origin and coevolution. Their important role in response to DNA damage
has been highlighted by the discovery of multiple copies of the Tp53 gene in
elephants. Expression of lamprey p53, Mdm2, and Mdm4 proteins in mammalian cells 
reveals that the p53-Mdm2 interaction and the Mdm2/Mdm4 E3 ligase activity
existed in the common ancestor of vertebrates and have been conserved for >500
million years of vertebrate evolution. Lamprey Mdm2 degrades human p53 with great
efficiency, but this interaction is not blocked by currently available small
molecule inhibitors of the human HDM2 protein, suggesting utility of lamprey Mdm2
in the study of the human p53 signaling pathway.

We evaluated the influence of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene inhibition in
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cell line SKM-1 on enhancement of the
demethylating effects of decitabine on p15, and explored the possible mechanism. 
DNMT1 gene expression in SKM-1 cells was silenced by being transfected by a
constructed siRNA with liposomes. The proliferation inhibition rates after drug
treatment were detected by cell counting kit-8 assay. The apoptotic rates were
detected by Annexin V/PI assay with flow cytometry. The expressions of p16, p15, 
TP73, CDH1, ESR1, and PDLIM4 mRNAs were detected by real-time PCR, and those of
HO-1, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC, and p15 proteins were measured by western
blot. The degree of methylation of the p15 gene was analyzed by using
methylation-specific PCR (MSP). CCK-8 assay showed that after HO-1 gene
expression was inhibited; the proliferation rate of SKM-1 cells treated by
decitabine (70.91 ± 0.05%) was significantly higher than that of the control
group (53.67 ± 0.05%). Flow cytometry showed that the apoptotic rate of SKM- 1
cells treated by decitabine in combination with HO-1 expression inhibition (44.25
± 0.05%) exceeded that of the cells treated by this drug alone (37.70 ± 0.05%).
MSP showed that inhibiting HO-1 expression significantly increased the degree of 
methylation of the p15 gene. As suggested by western blot, the degree of
methylation of the p15 protein was changed after decitabine treatment when the
expression of the HO-1 protein was changed, being associated with the affected
DNMT1 expression. Inhibited HO-1 expression attenuated the hypermethylation of
CDKN2B by suppressing DNMT1, which was conducive to treatment by cooperating with
decitabine. In conclusion, the findings of this study provide valuable
experimental evidence for targeted MDS therapy, and a theoretical basis for
further studies.

The goal of this study was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in genes involved in gemcitabine metabolism, DNA damage repair, multidrug 
resistance, and alkylator detoxification influence the clinical outcome of
patients with refractory/relapsed lymphoid malignancies receiving high-dose
gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan (Gem/Bu/Mel) with autologous stem cell support. We
evaluated 21 germline SNPs of the gemcitabine metabolism genes CDA, deoxycytidine
kinase, and hCNT3; DNA damage repair genes RECQL, X-ray repair complementing 1,
RAD54L, ATM, ATR, MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, TREX1, EXO1, and TP73; and
multidrug-resistance genes MRP2 and MRP5; as well as glutathione-S-transferase
GSTP1 in 153 patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or myeloma receiving
Gem/Bu/Mel. We studied the association of genotypes with overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival (PFS), and nonhematological grade 3 or 4 toxicity. CDA 
C111T and TREX1 Ex14-460C>T genotypes had a significant effect on OS (P = .007
and P = .005, respectively), and CDA C111T, ATR C340T, and EXO1 P757L genotypes
were significant predictors for severe toxicity (P = .037, P = .024, and
P = .025, respectively) in multivariable models that adjusted for clinical
variables. The multi-SNP risk score analysis identified the combined genotypes of
TREX1 Ex14-460 TT and hCNT3 Ex5 +25A>G AA as significant predictors for OS and
the combination of MRP2 Ex10 + 40GG/GA and MLH1 IVS12-169 TT as significant
predictor for PFS. Polymorphic variants of certain genes involved in gemcitabine 
metabolism and DNA damage repair pathways may be potential biomarkers for
clinical outcome in patients with refractory/relapsed lymphoid tumors receiving
Gem/Bu/Mel.

BACKGROUND: Patients with breast cancer have an increased risk of developing
subsequent breast cancers. It is important to distinguish whether these tumours
are de novo or recurrences of the primary tumour in order to guide the
appropriate therapy. Our aim was to investigate the use of DNA methylation
profiling and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine whether
the second tumour is clonally related to the first tumour.
METHODS: Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting was used to screen
promoter methylation in a panel of 13 genes reported as methylated in breast
cancer (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, CDH13, RARß, BRCA1, CDH1, CDKN2A, 
TP73, and GSTP1) in 29 tumour pairs (16 ipsilateral and 13 contralateral). Using 
the methylation profile of these genes, we employed a Bayesian and an empirical
statistical approach to estimate clonal relationship. Copy number alterations
were analysed using aCGH on the same set of tumour pairs.
RESULTS: There is a higher probability of the second tumour being recurrent in
ipsilateral tumours compared with contralateral tumours (38 % versus 8 %;
p<U+2009><0.05) based on the methylation profile. Using previously reported recurrence
rates as Bayesian prior probabilities, we classified 69 % of ipsilateral and 15 %
of contralateral tumours as recurrent. The inferred clonal relationship results
of the tumour pairs were generally concordant between methylation profiling and
aCGH.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that DNA methylation profiling as well as aCGH have 
potential as diagnostic tools in improving the clinical decisions to
differentiate recurrences from a second de novo tumour.

Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T cell neoplasm of largely
unknown genetic basis, associated with human T cell leukemia virus type-1
(HTLV-1) infection. Here we describe an integrated molecular study in which we
performed whole-genome, exome, transcriptome and targeted resequencing, as well
as array-based copy number and methylation analyses, in a total of 426 ATL cases.
The identified alterations overlap significantly with the HTLV-1 Tax interactome 
and are highly enriched for T cell receptor-NF-<U+03BA>B signaling, T cell trafficking
and other T cell-related pathways as well as immunosurveillance. Other notable
features include a predominance of activating mutations (in PLCG1, PRKCB, CARD11,
VAV1, IRF4, FYN, CCR4 and CCR7) and gene fusions (CTLA4-CD28 and ICOS-CD28). We
also discovered frequent intragenic deletions involving IKZF2, CARD11 and TP73
and mutations in GATA3, HNRNPA2B1, GPR183, CSNK2A1, CSNK2B and CSNK1A1. Our
findings not only provide unique insights into key molecules in T cell signaling 
but will also guide the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics in this

The TP73 gene transcript is alternatively spliced and translated into the
transcriptionally active (TAp73) or inactive (<U+0394>Np73) isoforms, with opposite
effects on the expression of p53 target genes and on apoptosis induction. The
imbalance between <U+0394>Np73 and TAp73 may contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance 
to chemotherapy in human cancers, including hematologic malignancies. In acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), both isoforms are expressed, but their relevance in
determining response to therapy and contribution to leukemogenesis remains
unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that a higher <U+0394>Np73/TAp73 RNA
expression ratio is associated with lower survival, lower disease-free survival, 
and higher risk of relapse in patients with APL homogeneously treated with
all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, according to the
International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (IC-APL) study. Cox
proportional hazards modeling showed that a high <U+0394>Np73/TAp73 ratio was
independently associated with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95%
confidence interval, 1.64-12.2; P = .0035). Our data support the hypothesis that 
the <U+0394>Np73/TAp73 ratio is an important determinant of clinical response in APL and
may offer a therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in blast cells.

In multiple myeloma, a long non-coding RNA, KIAA0495 (alias PDAM/TP73-AS1), had
been found progressively downregulated from normal plasma cell to benign
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to symptomatic myeloma.
Herein, by methylation-specific PCR, the putative KIAA0495 promoter was found
unmethylated in all healthy controls (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>14) but methylated in 50 % of myeloma
cell lines (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>10). KIAA0495 methylation was shown inversely correlated with
KIAA0495 expression. However, KIAA0495 methylation was detected in none of both
primary myeloma samples at diagnosis (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>61) and at relapse/progression
(N<U+2009>=<U+2009>16). Collectively, despite frequently methylated in cell lines, KIAA0495
methylation appeared unimportant in the pathogenesis or progression of myeloma.

BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic invasive lobular cancer (pleomorphic ILC) is a rare
variant of ILC that is characterized by a classic ILC-like growth pattern
combined with an infiltrative ductal cancer (IDC)-like high nuclear atypicality. 
There is an ongoing discussion whether pleomorphic ILC is a dedifferentiated form
of ILC or in origin an IDC with a secondary loss of cohesion. Since gene promoter
hypermethylation is an early event in breast carcinogenesis and thus may provide 
information on tumor progression, we set out to compare the methylation patterns 
of pleomorphic ILC, classic ILC and IDC. In addition, we aimed at analyzing the
methylation status of pleomorphic ILC.
METHODS: We performed promoter methylation profiling of 24 established and
putative tumor suppressor genes by methylation-specific multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) analysis in 20 classical ILC, 16
pleomorphic ILC and 20 IDC cases.
RESULTS: We found that pleomorphic ILC showed relatively low TP73 and MLH1
methylation levels and relatively high RASSF1A methylation levels compared to
classic ILC. Compared to IDC, pleomorphic ILC showed relatively low MLH1 and
BRCA1 methylation levels. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a similar
methylation pattern for pleomorphic ILC and IDC, while the methylation pattern of
classic ILC was different.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report to identify TP73, RASSF1A, MLH1 and BRCA1 as
possible biomarkers to distinguish pleomorphic ILC from classic ILC and IDC.

IL-6 signaling contributes to cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer 
via the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic and DNA repair associated molecules.

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is currently the most effective treatment regimen
for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but eventually tumor resistance develops 
which limits its success. The potential implication of IL-6 signaling in the
cisplatin resistance of NSCLC was explored by testing whether NSCLC cells with
different levels of intracellular IL-6 show different responses to the cytotoxic 
treatment of cisplatin. When the cisplatin cytotoxicity of the IL-6 knocked down 
human NSCLC cells (A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si) were compared with their
corresponding scramble control cells (A549sc and H157sc), higher cisplatin
cytotoxicity was found in IL-6 si cells than sc cells. Subcutaneous xenograft
mouse models were developed using a pair of A549sc and A549IL-6si cells. When the
tumor grew to about 400 mm2, mice were treated with cisplatin and tumor
regression was monitored. Higher tumor regression was detected in the A549IL-6si 
xenografts compared to A549sc xenografts following cisplatin treatment.
Immunostaining study results from tumor tissues also supported this finding.
Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and DNA repair associated
molecules ATM, CHK1, TP73, p53, and ERCC1 were significantly up regulated in
cisplatin-treated A549sc and H157sc cells, but no increase was detected in
A549IL-6si and H157IL-6si cells. Further inhibitor studies revealed that up
regulation of these molecules by IL-6 may be through activation of IL-6
downstream signaling pathways like Akt, MAPK, Stat3, and Erk. These results
provide potential for combining cisplatin and inhibitors of IL-6 signaling or its
downstream signaling pathway as a future therapeutic approach in preventing
development of cisplatin resistant NSCLC tumors.

Accumulating evidence supports the idea that secondary metabolites obtained from 
medicinal plants (phytometabolites) may be important contributors in the
development of new chemotherapeutic agents to reduce the occurrence or recurrence
of cancer. Our study focused on Dehydroleucodine (DhL), a sesquiterpene found in 
the provinces of Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe. In this study, we showed that DhL
displayed cytostatic and cytotoxic activities on the human cerebral astrocytoma
D384 cell line. With lactone isolated from Gynoxys verrucosa Wedd, a medicinal
plant from Ecuador, we found that DhL induced cell death in D384 cells by
triggering cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis and DNA damage. We further
found that the cell death resulted in the increased expression of CDKN1A and BAX 
proteins. A marked induction of the levels of total TP73 and phosphorylated TP53,
TP73, and <U+03B3>-H2AX proteins was observed in D384 cells exposed to DhL, but no
increase in total TP53 levels was detected. Overall these studies demonstrated
the marked effect of DhL on the diminished survival of human astrocytoma cells
through the induced expression of TP73 and phosphorylation of TP73 and TP53,
suggesting their key roles in the tumor cell response to DhL treatment.

We have sequenced the genomes of 110 small cell lung cancers (SCLC), one of the
deadliest human cancers. In nearly all the tumours analysed we found bi-allelic
inactivation of TP53 and RB1, sometimes by complex genomic rearrangements. Two
tumours with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to
overexpression of cyclin D1 (encoded by the CCND1 gene), revealing an alternative
mechanism of Rb1 deregulation. Thus, loss of the tumour suppressors TP53 and RB1 
is obligatory in SCLC. We discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that 
create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73<U+0394>ex2/3. In rare cases, SCLC tumours
exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for
individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family 
genes in 25% of human SCLC. Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling in a
pre-clinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumours and
extended the survival of the mutant mice. Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene
expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells. This first
comprehensive study of somatic genome alterations in SCLC uncovers several key
biological processes and identifies candidate therapeutic targets in this highly 
lethal form of cancer.

Recent research has demonstrated that the nicotinergic signaling network of
mammary epithelium can both mediate the physiological control of normal breast
epithelial cells (BECs) and exhibit tumor-promoting effects on malignant BECs.
Therefore, mammary nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) may become a 
specific target for novel anti-breast cancer therapies. Toward this goal, we
investigated the difference in the ACh receptor repertoires between normal and
malignant BECs, determined effects of nicotinic ligands on
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-dependent activation of
ERK1/2 and tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells, and characterized
reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP (secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase
plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1)-1 on the expression of nAChR
subunits and several oncogenes and tumor-suppressing genes in BECs. Both the
non-malignant MCF10A and malignant MCF7 breast cells expressed a3, a5, a7, a9,
a10, ß1, ß2, <U+03B3>, d and e nAChR subunits and M(1), M(3), M(4) and M(5) muscarinic
receptor subtypes. The malignancy was associated with expression of a1, a4 and ß4
nAChR subunits and M(2) subtype. Malignant transformation of BECs was also
associated with overexpression of a7-, and a9-made nAChRs. NNK upregulated ERK1/2
phosphorylation, stimulated expression of the gene encoding the tumor-promoter
HGF, downregulated expression of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, and induced
tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells. Compared to the canonical nAChR
antagonists, SLURP-1 showed the highest ability to abolish the nAChR-mediated
effects of NNK in both cell-signaling and cell-transformation assays and reversed
many effects of NNK on gene expression. SLURP-1 also markedly upregulated the
tumor suppressor genes CDKN2B, RUNX3 and TP73. Altogether, the obtained results
provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms of nAChR-mediated oncogenic
effects of NNK on BECs and demonstrated the ability to abolish or reverse these
effects by SLURP-1.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of brain
cancer. Our previous studies demonstrated that combined inhibition of HDAC and
KDM1A increases apoptotic cell death in vitro. However, whether this combination 
also increases death of the glioma stem cell (GSC) population or has an effect in
vivo is yet to be determined. Therefore, we evaluated the translational potential
of combined HDAC and KDM1A inhibition on patient-derived GSCs and xenograft GBM
mouse models. We also investigated the changes in transcriptional programing
induced by the combination in an effort to understand the induced molecular
mechanisms of GBM cell death.
METHODS: Patient-derived GSCs were treated with the combination of vorinostat, a 
pan-HDAC inhibitor, and tranylcypromine, a KDM1A inhibitor, and viability was
measured. To characterize transcriptional profiles associated with cell death, we
used RNA-Seq and validated gene changes by RT-qPCR and protein expression via
Western blot. Apoptosis was measured using DNA fragmentation assays. Orthotopic
xenograft studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the combination on
tumorigenesis and to validate gene changes in vivo.
RESULTS: The combination of vorinostat and tranylcypromine reduced GSC viability 
and displayed efficacy in the U87 xenograft model. Additionally, the combination 
led to changes in apoptosis-related genes, particularly TP53 and TP73 in vitro
and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support targeting HDACs and KDM1A in combination as a
strategy for GBM and identifies TP53 and TP73 as being altered in response to
treatment.

It's known that the members of the TP53 family are involved in the regulation of 
female reproduction. Studies in mice showed that the TP73 gene (member of this
family) plays a role in the size of follicular pool, ovulation rate and
maintenance of genomic stability. In the present study we analyzed data from 605 
patients with = 37 years attending their first intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI). The association between the TP73 polymorphism (rs4648551, A>G) and the
following parameters related to ovarian reserve, like age, antral follicular
count (AFC), anti-Mullerian hormone levels (AMH) and ovarian response prediction 
index (ORPI) was evaluated. Our results showed an association of the AA genotype 
with diminished ovarian reserve (AMH <1, AFC =9). Women presenting the AA
genotype had a 2.0-fold increased risk for having AMH <1 and AFC =9 (OR 2.0, 95% 
CI 1.23-3.31, P = 0.005). Patients presenting AA genotype had the lowest levels
of AMH (P = 0.02), the lowest number of antral follicles (P = 0.01) and the
lowest ORPI (P = 0.007). Analyzing the alleles, we can see an enrichment of the A
allele in the group of diminished ovarian reserve (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.02-1.83, P =
0.04). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze
this polymorphism in humans for assessing the numbers of ovarian follicles and
AMH levels and, therefore, the ovarian reserve. Our findings can contribute to
the use of this polymorphism as a potential marker of diminished ovarian reserve.

Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection appears to trigger the onset of
immune exhaustion to potentially assist viral persistence in the host, eventually
leading to hepatocellular carcinoma. The role of HCV on the spontaneous
expression of markers suggestive of immune exhaustion and spontaneous apoptosis
in immune cells of chronic HCV (CHC) disease largely remain elusive. We
investigated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CHC patients to determine 
the spontaneous recruitment of cellular reactive oxygen species (cROS),
immunoregulatory and exhaustion markers relative to healthy controls. Using a
commercial QuantiGenePlex(®) 2.0 assay, we determined the spontaneous expression 
profile of 80 different pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in persistent HCV disease. 
Onset of spontaneous apoptosis significantly correlated with the up-regulation of
cROS, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin H
synthase (COX-2/PGHS), Foxp3, Dtx1, Blimp1, Lag3 and Cd160. Besides, spontaneous 
differential surface protein expression suggestive of T cell inhibition viz.,
TRAIL, TIM-3, PD-1 and BTLA on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CTLA-4 on CD4+ T cells 
was also evident. Increased up-regulation of Tnf, Tp73, Casp14, Tnfrsf11b, Bik
and Birc8 was observed, whereas FasLG, Fas, Ripk2, Casp3, Dapk1, Tnfrsf21, and
Cflar were moderately up-regulated in HCV-infected subjects. Our observation
suggests the spontaneous onset of apoptosis signaling and T cell exhaustion in
chronic HCV disease.

TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses
tumours in vivo in mice (TP53 and Tp53 are also known as p53). This strategy has 
proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we examine an alternative
strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, Tp63 and Tp73 (also known as p63
and p73, respectively). The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing (TA) isoforms
of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, whereas the <U+0394>N
isoforms (lacking the acidic transactivation domain) of p63 and p73 are
frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative
fashion against p53, TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive
functions. The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that
promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy, thus a clear
understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with
alterations in the p53 pathway. Here we show that deletion of the <U+0394>N isoforms of 
p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient
tumours through upregulation of IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a
37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the ß cells of the pancreas. We
found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin
functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor activity modifying
protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and
apoptosis. Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to 
treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient
thymic lymphomas, representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers.

A balancing act: orchestrating amino-truncated and full-length p73 variants as
decisive factors in cancer progression.

p73 is the older sibling of p53 and mimics most of its tumor-suppressor
functions. Through alternative promoter usage and splicing, the TP73 gene
generates more than two dozen isoforms of which N-terminal truncated DNp73
variants have a decisive role in cancer pathogenesis as they outweigh the
positive effects of full-length TAp73 and p53 in acting as a barrier to tumor
development. Beyond the prevailing view that DNp73 predominantly counteract cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis, latest progress indicates that these isoforms acquire
novel functions in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis and therapy
resistance. New insight into the mechanisms underlying this behavior reinforced
the expectation that DNp73 variants contribute to aggressive cellular traits
through both loss of wild-type tumor-suppressor activity and gain-of-function,
suggesting an equally important role in cancer progression as mutant p53. In this
review, we describe the novel properties of DNp73 in the invasion metastasis
cascade and outline the comprehensive p73 regulatome with an emphasis on
molecular processes putting TAp73 out of action in advanced tumors. These
intriguing insights provoke a new understanding of the acquisition of aggressive 
traits by cancer cells and may help to set novel therapies for a broad range of
metastatic tumors.

BACKGROUND: Promoter hypermethylation leads to altered gene functions and may
result in malignant cellular transformation. Thus, identification of biomarkers
for hypermethylated genes could be useful for diagnosis, prognosis, and
therapeutic treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
OBJECTIVES: To screen hypermethylated genes with a microarray approach and to
validate selected hypermethylated genes with the methylation-specific polymerase 
chain reaction (MSPCR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genome-wide analysis of normal oral mucosa and OSCC
tissues was conducted using the Illumina methylation microarray. The specified
differential genes were selected and hypermethylation status was further verified
with an independent cohort sample of OSCC samples. Candidate genes were screened 
using microarray assay and run by MSPCR analysis.
RESULTS: TP73, PIK3R5, and CELSR3 demonstrated high percentages of differential
hypermethylation status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our microarray screening and MSPCR approaches revealed that the
signature candidates of differentially hypermethylated genes may possibly become 
potential biomarkers which would be useful for diagnostic, prognostic and
therapeutic targets of OSCC in the near future.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have investigated the role of the p53 gene family in
reproductive processes. Each member of the gene family acts through different
mechanisms: p53 is involved in genomic stability and regulation of blastocyst
implantation; p63 acts as a regulator of the quality and maturation of oocytes;
and p73 controls the meiotic spindle. Polymorphisms in the genes of the p53
family have been associated with female infertility. One polymorphism in MDM2,
the main regulator of the p53 family, has also been associated with this
condition. Although polymorphisms in the TP53 gene have been related to recurrent
pregnancy loss (RPL), there have been no studies associating polymorphisms in p63
and p73 with RPL. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of
polymorphisms in the TP63 (rs17506395), TP73 (rs2273953, rs1801173), and MDM2
(SNP309, rs2279744) genes as risk factors for RPL.
STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted in 153 women with RPL and 143
fertile women with at least two living children and no history of pregnancy loss.
Molecular analysis was performed by TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assay. The
statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20.0 and the
chi-square test, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression to
compare the evaluated characteristics between both groups and RPL outcome.
RESULTS: The allelic and genotypic frequencies did not differ between the groups 
when analyzed separately, however, the interaction between the TP63 TT and MDM2
TT genotypes was shown to increase the risk of RPL (OR=2.19, CI 95%: 1.28-3.75,
p=0.004), even when adjusted for alcohol consumption, smoking, number of
pregnancies and ethnicity (OR=1.97, CI 95%: 1.27-3.58, p=0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genes from the p53 family proteins,
evaluated here, have an influence on the risk of RPL.

Silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) by DNA promoter hypermethylation is an
early event in carcinogenesis and a potential target for personalized cancer
treatment. In head and neck cancer, little is known about the role of promoter
hypermethylation in survival. Using methylation specific multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) we investigated the role of
promoter hypermethylation of 24 well-described genes (some of which are classic
TSGs), which are frequently methylated in different cancer types, in 166
HPV-negative early oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC), and 51 HPV-negative
early oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) in relation to
clinicopathological features and survival. Early OSCC showed frequent promoter
hypermethylation in RARB (31% of cases), CHFR (20%), CDH13 (13%), DAPK1 (12%),
and APC (10%). More hypermethylation (= 2 genes) independently correlated with
improved disease specific survival (hazard ratio 0.17, P = 0.014) in early OSCC
and could therefore be used as prognostic biomarker. Early OPSCCs showed more
hypermethylation of CDH13 (58%), TP73 (14%), and total hypermethylated genes.
Hypermethylation of two or more genes has a significantly different effect on
survival in OPSCC compared with OSCC, with a trend toward worse instead of better
survival. This could have a biological explanation, which deserves further
investigation and could possibly lead to more stratified treatment in the future.

During the recent years lysine methyltransferase Set7/9 ((Su(var)-3-9,
Enhancer-of-Zeste, Trithorax) domain containing protein 7/9) has emerged as an
important regulator of different transcription factors. In this study, we report 
a novel function for Set7/9 as a critical co-activator of E2 promoter-binding
factor 1 (E2F1)-dependent transcription in response to DNA damage. By means of
various biochemical, cell biology, and bioinformatics approaches, we uncovered
that cell-cycle progression through the G1/S checkpoint of tumour cells upon DNA 
damage is defined by the threshold of expression of both E2F1 and Set7/9. The
latter affects the activity of E2F1 by indirectly modulating histone
modifications in the promoters of E2F1-dependent genes. Moreover, Set7/9
differentially affects E2F1 transcription targets: it promotes cell proliferation
via expression of the CCNE1 gene and represses apoptosis by inhibiting the TP73
gene. Our biochemical screening of the panel of lung tumour cell lines suggests
that these two factors are critically important for transcriptional upregulation 
of the CCNE1 gene product and hence successful progression through cell cycle.
These findings identify Set7/9 as a potential biomarker in tumour cells with
overexpressed E2F1 activity.

OCT4B1 is a newly discovered spliced variant of OCT4 which is primarily expressed
in pluripotent and tumor cells. Based on our previous studies, OCT4B1 is
significantly overexpressed in tumors, where it endows an anti-apoptotic property
to tumor cells. However, the mechanism by which OCT4B1 regulates the apoptotic
pathway is not yet elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of OCT4B1
suppression on the expression alteration of 84 genes involved in apoptotic
pathway. The AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma), 5637 (bladder tumor), and U-87MG
(brain tumor) cell lines were transfected with OCT4B1 or irrelevant siRNAs. The
expression level of apoptotic genes was then quantified using a human apoptosis
panel-PCR kit. Our data revealed an almost similar pattern of alteration in the
expression profile of apoptotic genes in all three studied cell lines, following 
OCT4B1 suppression. In general, the expression of more than 54 apoptotic genes
(64 % of arrayed genes) showed significant changes. Among these, some
up-regulated (CIDEA, CIDEB, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF21, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF10B, and CASP7) 
and down-regulated (BCL2, BCL2L11, TP73, TP53, BAD, TRAF3, TRAF2, BRAF, BNIP3L,
BFAR, and BAX) genes had on average more than tenfold gene expression alteration 
in all three examined cell lines. With some minor exceptions, suppression of
OCT4B1 caused upregulation of pro-apoptotic and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic
genes in transfected tumor cells. Uncovering OCT4B1 down-stream targets could
further elucidate its part in tumorigenesis, and could lead to finding a new
approach to combat cancer, based on targeting OCT4B1.

TP53 belongs to a small gene family that includes, in mammals, two additional
paralogs, TP63 and TP73. The p63 and p73 proteins are structurally and
functionally similar to p53 and their activity as transcription factors is
regulated by a wide repertoire of shared and unique post-translational
modifications and interactions with regulatory cofactors. p63 and p73 have
important functions in embryonic development and differentiation but are also
involved in tumor suppression. The biology of p63 and p73 is complex since both
TP63 and TP73 genes are transcribed into a variety of different isoforms that
give rise to proteins with antagonistic properties, the TA-isoforms that act as
tumor-suppressors and DN-isoforms that behave as proto-oncogenes. The p53 family 
as a whole behaves as a signaling "network" that integrates developmental,
metabolic and stress signals to control cell metabolism, differentiation,
longevity, proliferation and death. Despite the progress of our knowledge, the
unresolved puzzle of complexity, redundancy and hierarchy in the p53 family
continues to represent a formidable challenge.

INTRODUCTION: Germline variants in TP63 have been consistently associated with
several tumors, including bladder cancer, indicating the importance of TP53
pathway in cancer genetic susceptibility. However, variants in other related
genes, including TP53 rs1042522 (Arg72Pro), still present controversial results. 
We carried out an in depth assessment of associations between common germline
variants in the TP53 pathway and bladder cancer risk.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated 184 tagSNPs from 18 genes in 1,058 cases
and 1,138 controls from the Spanish Bladder Cancer/EPICURO Study. Cases were
newly-diagnosed bladder cancer patients during 1998-2001. Hospital controls were 
age-gender, and area matched to cases. SNPs were genotyped in blood DNA using
Illumina Golden Gate and TaqMan assays. Cases were subphenotyped according to
stage/grade and tumor p53 expression. We applied classical tests to assess
individual SNP associations and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator (LASSO)-penalized logistic regression analysis to assess multiple SNPs
simultaneously.
RESULTS: Based on classical analyses, SNPs in BAK1 (1), IGF1R (5), P53AIP1 (1),
PMAIP1 (2), SERINPB5 (3), TP63 (3), and TP73 (1) showed significant associations 
at p-value=0.05. However, no evidence of association, either with overall risk or
with specific disease subtypes, was observed after correction for multiple
testing (p-value=0.8). LASSO selected the SNP rs6567355 in SERPINB5 with 83% of
reproducibility. This SNP provided an OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.21, 95%CI 1.05-1.38,
p-value<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.006, and a corrected p-value<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.5 when controlling for
over-estimation.
DISCUSSION: We found no strong evidence that common variants in the TP53 pathway 
are associated with bladder cancer susceptibility. Our study suggests that it is 
unlikely that TP53 Arg72Pro is implicated in the UCB in white Europeans. SERPINB5
and TP63 variation deserve further exploration in extended studies.

Protein p73 is a member of the p53 protein family that can induce cell cycle
arrest or apoptosis by the activation of p53-responsive genes as well as
p53-independent pathways. Alternative promoter usage, together with differential 
splicing of the C-terminal exons, forms several distinct mRNAs that are
translated into corresponding protein isoforms containing different domains.
While TAp73 isoforms respond to genotoxic stress in a manner similar to tumor
suppressor p53, <U+0394>TAp73 isoforms inhibit apoptosis during normal development and
in cancer cell lines. Thus, the impact of p73 on tumorigenesis depends on a
subtle balance between tumor-promoting and -suppressing isoforms. Due to the
structural homology between p53 and p73, a subtle balance among p53 family
members and their isoforms could influence glioma cell evolution toward
malignancy. Thus, the p73 status has to be considered when studying the
regulatory role of p53 protein in gliomagenesis. The presented review summarizes 
recent knowledge about the issue of p73 and its isoforms with respect to
neuro-oncology research.

The TP73 gene is a member of the TP53 family with high structural homology to p53
and capable of transactivating p53 target genes. The TP73 gene locus which is
highly conserved and complex, encodes for two classes of isoforms TAp73 (tumor
suppressor isoforms containing the transactivation domain) and <U+0394>Np73 (oncogenic
isoforms, truncated and lacking the transactivation domain) with opposing
effects. The balance between TAp73 and <U+0394>Np73 isoforms and their harmony with
other members of the TP73 family regulate various cellular responses such as
apoptosis, autophagy, proliferation, and differentiation. The transcriptionally
active isoforms of p73 are capable of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells
independent of p53 status. Unlike p53, p73 is rarely mutated in cancers, however,
the ratio of <U+0394>Np73:TAp73 is frequently up-regulated in many carcinomas and is
indicative of poor prognosis. Moreover, p73 is an important determinant of
chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity, the two major treatment modalities for
lymphoma. In the current review, we will provide an overview of recent progress
discussing the role of TP73 in cancer, specifically addressing its relevance to
lymphomagenesis, progression, therapy resistance, and its potential as a novel
therapeutic target.

Aberrant DNA hypomethylation may play an important role in the growth rate of
glioblastoma (GBM), but the functional impact on transcription remains poorly
understood. We assayed the GBM methylome with MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq, adjusting
for copy number differences, in a small set of non-glioma CpG island methylator
phenotype (non-G-CIMP) primary tumors. Recurrent hypomethylated loci were
enriched within a region of chromosome 5p15 that is specified as a cancer
amplicon and also encompasses TERT, encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase,
which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Overall, 76 gene body promoters
were recurrently hypomethylated, including TERT and the oncogenes GLI3 and TP73. 
Recurring hypomethylation also affected previously unannotated alternative
promoters, and luciferase reporter assays for three of four of these promoters
confirmed strong promoter activity in GBM cells. Histone H3 lysine 4
trimethylation (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq on tissue from the GBMs uncovered peaks that
coincide precisely with tumor-specific decrease of DNA methylation at 200 loci,
133 of which are in gene bodies. Detailed investigation of TP73 and TERT gene
body hypomethylation demonstrated increased expression of corresponding alternate
transcripts, which in TP73 encodes a truncated p73 protein with oncogenic
function and in TERT encodes a putative reverse transcriptase-null protein. Our
findings suggest that recurring gene body promoter hypomethylation events, along 
with histone H3K4 trimethylation, alter the transcriptional landscape of GBM
through the activation of a limited number of normally silenced promoters within 
gene bodies, in at least one case leading to expression of an oncogenic protein.

Center , Omaha, NE , USA.

The TP73 gene is located at the chromosome 1p36 locus that is commonly disrupted 
or deleted in follicular lymphoma (FL) with poor prognosis. Therefore, we
analyzed the expression of the pro-apoptotic TAp73 and anti-apoptotic <U+0394>Np73
isoforms in cases of FL with normal or abnormal 1p36. We observed a significant
increase in <U+0394>Np73 expression and <U+0394>Np73:TAp73 ratio, lower expression of cleaved
caspase-3 and a higher frequency of Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA) positive cells in cases of FL with abnormal 1p36. A negative correlation
between the <U+0394>Np73:TAp73 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and a positive
correlation between <U+0394>Np73 expression and Ki-67 or PCNA, were observed. The
expression of TAp73 and its pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets BIM. PUMA and
NOXA were significantly lower in FL compared to reactive follicular hyperplasia. 
Together, our data demonstrate that 1p36 disruption is associated with increased 
<U+0394>Np73 expression, decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in FL.

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Cisplatin is the
core of first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Many
patients eventually become resistant to cisplatin, diminishing its therapeutic
effect. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical functions in diverse biological
processes. Using miRNA profiling and polymerase chain reaction validation, we
identified a panel of differentially expressed miRNAs and their potential targets
in cisplatin-resistant SKOV3/DDP ovarian cancer cells relative to
cisplatin-sensitive SKOV3 parental cells. More specifically, our results revealed
significant changes in the expression of 13 of 663 miRNAs analyzed, including 11 
that were up-regulated and 2 that were down-regulated in SKOV3/DDP cells with or 
without cisplatin treatment compared with SKOV3 cells with or without cisplatin
treatment. miRNA array and mRNA array data were further analyzed using Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis software. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the genes
ANKRD17, SMC1A, SUMO1, GTF2H1, and TP73, which are involved in DNA damage
signaling pathways, are potential targets of miRNAs in promoting cisplatin
resistance. This study highlights candidate miRNA-mRNA interactions that may
contribute to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.

DNA methylation plays an important role in cancer biology and methylation events 
are important prognostic and predictive markers in many tumor types. We have used
methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to survey
the methylation status of MGMT and 25 tumor suppressor genes in 73 glioblastoma
cases. The data obtained was correlated with overall survival and response to
treatment. The study revealed that methylation of promoter regions in TP73 (seven
patients), THBS1 (eight patients) and PYCARD (nine patients) was associated with 
improved outcome, whereas GATA5 (21 patients) and WT1 (24 patients) promoter
methylation were associated with poor outcome. In patients treated with
temozolomide and radiation MGMT and PYCARD promoter methylation events remained
associated with improved survival whereas GATA5 was associated with a poor
outcome. The identification of GATA5 promoter methylation in glioblastoma has not
previously been reported. Furthermore, a cumulative methylation score separated
patients into survival groups better than any single methylation event. In
conclusion, we have identified specific methylation events associated with
patient outcome and treatment response in glioblastoma, and these may be of
functional and predictive/prognostic significance. This study therefore provides 
novel candidates and approaches for future prospective validation.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our meta-analyses is to test the association between six
genetic polymorphisms and gastric cancer.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed for all the available candidate genes 
and gastric cancer among several online databases including PubMed, Embase, Web
of Science, the Cochrane Library, CNKI and Wanfang online libraries. After a
comprehensive screening, a total of six genes were harvested for the current
meta-analyses. These genes include TLR2 (-196 to -174 ins>del), MTR (rs1805087), 
MTRR (rs1801394), XPC (rs2228001), TP73 (G4C14-A4T14), and TP53 (rs1042522).
RESULTS: Altogether 49 comparative studies among 11 776 cases and 18 633 controls
were involved in our meta-analyses. TP53 rs1042522 polymorphism was shown to be
associated with gastric cancer risk under the dominant model (P=0.02, OR=1.03,
95% CI=1.00-1.05). A subgroup meta-analysis indicated a significant association
under dominant model between TP53 rs1042522 and gastric cancer in the Eastern
Asians (P=0.03, OR=1.17, 95%=1.02-1.34).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TP53 rs1042522 polymorphism might
contribute to the susceptibility of gastric cancer under the dominant model,
especially in Eastern Asians.

How the TP53 family proteins TP63 and TP73 contribute to tumorigenesis:
regulators and effectors.

Candi E(1), Agostini M, Melino G, Bernassola F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome Tor
Vergata, Rome, 00133, Italy.

In mammals, the p53 family comprises two additional members, p63 and p73
(hereafter referred to as TP53, TP63, and TP73, respectively). The usage of two
alternative promoters produces protein variants either with (transactivating [TA]
isoforms) or without (<U+0394>N isoforms) the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD).
In general, the TA proteins exert TP53-like tumor-suppressive activities through 
their ability to activate a common set of target genes. The <U+0394>N proteins can act
as dominant-negative inhibitors of the transcriptionally active family members.
Additionally, they possess intrinsic-specific biological activities due to the
presence of alternative TADs, and as a result of engaging a different set of
regulators. This review summarizes the current understanding of upstream
regulators and downstream effectors of the TP53 family proteins, with particular 
emphasis on those that are relevant for their role in tumorigenesis. Furthermore,
we highlight the existence of networks and cross-talks among the TP53 family
members, their modulators, as well as the transcriptional targets.

Homozygous deletion of TNFRSF4, TP73, PPAP2B and DPYD at 1p and PDCD5 at 19q
identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis in
pediatric anaplastic glioma with questionable oligodendroglial component.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric oligodendrogliomas are rare and appear to show a different 
molecular profile from adult tumors. Some gliomas display allelic losses at
1p/19q in pediatric patients, although less frequently than in adult patients,
but this is rare in tumors with an oligodendroglial component. The molecular
basis of this genomic abnormality is unknown in pediatric gliomas, but it
represents a relatively common finding in pediatric oligodendroglioma-like
neoplasms with leptomeningeal dissemination.
RESULTS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis using
SALSA P088-B1 for the analysis of the 1p/19q allelic constitution in a pediatric 
anaplastic (oligodendro)-glioma showed homozygous co-deletion for markers:
TNFRSF4 (located at 1p36.33), TP73 (1p36.32), PPAP2B (1pter-p22.1), DPYD
(1p21.3), and PDCD5 (19q13.12), and hemizygous deletion of BAX (19q13.3-q13.4).
No sequence changes for R132 and R172 of the IDH1/2 genes were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The molecular findings in this pediatric anaplastic glioma do not
allow for a clearly definitive pathological diagnosis. However, the findings
provide data on a number of 1p/19q genomic regions that, because of homozygotic
deletion, might be the location of genes that are important for the development
and clinical evolution of some malignant gliomas in children.

A review of epigenetic and gene expression alterations associated with
intracranial meningiomas.

OBJECT: A more comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic abnormalities
associated with meningioma tumorigenesis, growth, and invasion may provide useful
targets for molecular classification and development of targeted therapies for
meningiomas.
METHODS: The authors performed a review of the current literature to identify the
epigenetic modifications associated with the formation and/or progression of
meningiomas.
RESULTS: Several epigenomic alterations, mainly pertaining to DNA methylation,
have been associated with meningiomas. Hypermethylation of TIMP3 inactivates its 
tumor suppression activity while CDKN2 (p14[ARF]) and TP73 gene hypermethylation 
and HIST1H1c upregulation interact with the p53 regulation of cell cycle control.
Other factors such as HOX, IGF, WNK2, and TGF-ß epigenetic modifications allow
either upregulation or downregulation of critical pathways for meningioma
development, progression, and recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide methylation profiling demonstrated that global
hypomethylation correlates with tumor grades and severity. Identification of
additional epigenetic changes, such as histone modification and higher-order
chromosomal structure, may allow for a more thorough understanding of
tumorigenesis and enable future individualized treatment strategies for
meningiomas.

BACKGROUND: Although non muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) generally has a
good long-term prognosis, up to 80% of patients will nevertheless experience
local recurrence after the primary tumor resection. The search for markers
capable of accurately identifying patients at high risk of recurrence is ongoing.
We retrospectively evaluated the methylation status of a panel of 24 tumor
suppressor genes (TIMP3, APC, CDKN2A, MLH1, ATM, RARB, CDKN2B, HIC1, CHFR, BRCA1,
CASP8, CDKN1B, PTEN, BRCA2, CD44, RASSF1, DAPK1, FHIT, VHL, ESR1, TP73, IGSF4,
GSTP1 and CDH13) in primary lesions to obtain information about their role in
predicting local recurrence in NMIBC.
METHODS: Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 74 patients
operated on for bladder cancer were analyzed by methylation-specific multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA): 36 patients had relapsed and 38
were disease-free at the 5-year follow up. Methylation status was considered as a
dichotomous variable and genes showing methylation =20% were defined as
"positive".
RESULTS: Methylation frequencies were higher in non recurring than recurring
tumors. A statistically significant difference was observed for HIC1 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03), 
GSTP1 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02) and RASSF1 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03). The combination of the three genes showed
78% sensitivity and 66% specificity in identifying recurrent patients, with an
overall accuracy of 72%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest a potential role of HIC1, GSTP1 and
RASSF1 in predicting local recurrence in NMIBC. Such information could help
clinicians to identify patients at high risk of recurrence who require close
monitoring during follow up.

Monosomy 1p36 is the most common subtelomeric chromosomal deletion linked to
mental retardation and seizures. Neuroimaging studies suggest that monosomy 1p36 
is associated with brain malformations including polymicrogyria and nodular
heterotopia, but the histopathology of these lesions is unknown. Here we present 
postmortem neuropathological findings from a 10 year-old girl with monosomy 1p36,
who died of respiratory complications. The findings included micrencephaly,
periventricular nodular heterotopia in occipitotemporal lobes, cortical
dysgenesis resembling polymicrogyria in dorsolateral frontal lobes, hippocampal
malrotation, callosal hypoplasia, superiorly rotated cerebellum with small
vermis, and lumbosacral hydromyelia. The abnormal cortex exhibited "festooned"
(undulating) supragranular layers, but no significant fusion of the molecular
layer. Deletion mapping demonstrated single copy loss of a contiguous 1p36
terminal region encompassing many important neurodevelopmental genes, among them 
four HES genes implicated in regulating neural stem cell differentiation, and
TP73, a monoallelically expressed gene. Our results suggest that brain and spinal
malformations in monosomy 1p36 may be more extensive than previously recognized, 
and may depend on the parental origin of deleted genes. More broadly, our results
suggest that specific genetic disorders may cause distinct forms of cortical
dysgenesis.

Endometrial cancer is a lethal malignancy, the causes of which remain to be
determined. The aim of the present study, carried out on tumor samples from 79
patients, was to evaluate the role of the WWOX tumor suppressor gene in
endometrial adenocarcinoma. The expression levels of WWOX and its protein content
were assessed in normal endometrium and cancer samples. Quantitative PCR was used
to assess the correlation between the expression levels of WWOX and the genes
involved in the proliferation (MKI67), apoptosis (BAX, BCL2), signal transduction
(EGFR), cell cycle (CCNE1, CCND1), cell adhesion (CDH1) and transcription
regulation (TP73, NCOR1). The relationship between loss of hetero-zygosity (LOH) 
and WWOX mRNA levels was also investigated using high resolution melting. Results
of the present study demonstrated a positive correlation of WWOX expression with 
BCL2 and CCND1 and a negative correlation with BAX, CDH1, NCOR1 and BCL2/BAX
ratio. The results also showed that loss of heterozygosity at two analyzed loci
of the WWOX gene is frequent in patients with endometrial cancer and that WWOX
expression levels are lower in tumor samples than in normal tissue. In
conclusion, WWOX may be involved in endometrial cancer.

It is well established that transcriptional silencing of critical
tumor-suppressor genes by DNA methylation is a fundamental component in the
initiation of breast cancer. However, the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in
restoring abnormal DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer is not well
understood. Therefore, we investigated whether miRNA-29b, due to its
complimentarity to the 3'- untranslated region of DNA methyltransferase 3A
(DNMT3A) and DNMT3B, could restore normal DNA methylation patterns in human
breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that transfection of
pre-miRNA-29b into less aggressive MCF-7 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal
cells, inhibited cell proliferation, decreased DNMT3A and DNMT3B messenger RNA
(mRNA), and decreased promoter methylation status of ADAM23 , CCNA1, CCND2, CDH1,
CDKN1C, CDKN2A, HIC1, RASSF1, SLIT2, TNFRSF10D, and TP73 tumor-suppressor genes. 
Using methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time PCR, we
also demonstrated that the methylation status of several critical
tumor-suppressor genes increased as stage of breast disease increased, while
miRNA-29b mRNA levels were significantly decreased in breast cancers versus
normal breast. This increase in methylation status was accompanied by an increase
in DNMT1 and DNMT3B mRNA in advanced stage of human breast cancers and in MCF-7, 
MDA-MB-361, HCC70, Hs-578T, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to
normal breast specimens and MCF-10-2A, a non-tumorigenic breast cell line,
respectively. Our findings highlight the potential for a new epigenetic approach 
in improving breast cancer therapy by targeting DNMT3A and DNMT3B through
miRNA-29b in non-invasive epithelial breast cancer cells.

TP73 is a member of the TP53 family, whose deregulated expression has been
reported in a wide variety of cancers and linked to patients' outcome. The fact
that TP73 encodes a complex number of isoforms (TAp73 and <U+0394>TAp73) with opposing
functions and the cross-talk with other members of the family (TP53 and TP63)
make it difficult to determine its clinical relevance. Here, we review the
molecular mechanisms driving TAp73 and <U+0394>TAp73 expression and how these variants
inhibit or promote carcinogenesis. We also highlight the intricate interplay
between TP53 family members. In addition, we comment on current pharmacological
approaches targeting the TP73 pathway and those affecting the TAp73/<U+0394>TAp73 ratio.
Finally, we discuss the current data available in the literature that provide
evidence on the role of TP73 variants in predicting prognosis. To date, most of
the studies that evaluate the status levels of TP73 isoforms have been based on
limited-size series. Despite this limitation, these publications highlight the
correlation between high levels of the oncogenic forms and failure to respond to 
chemotherapy and/or shorter survival. Finally, we emphasize the need for studies 
to evaluate the significance of combining the deregulation of various members of 
the TP53 family in order to define patient outcome or their responsiveness to
specific therapies.

Dysregulated methylation at imprinted genes in prostate tumor tissue detected by 
methylation microarray.

CT, USA.

BACKGROUND: Imprinting is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression
that is often disrupted in cancer. While loss of imprinting (LOI) has been
reported for two genes in prostate cancer (IGF2 and TFPI2), disease-related
changes in methylation across all imprinted gene regions has not been
investigated.
METHODS: Using an Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay, we analyzed methylation of
396 CpG sites in the promoter regions of 56 genes in a pooled sample of 12 pairs 
of prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Selected LOI identified from the
array was validated using the Sequenom EpiTYPER assay for individual samples and 
further confirmed by expression data from publicly available datasets.
RESULTS: Methylation significantly increased in 52 sites and significantly
decreased in 17 sites across 28 unique genes (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05), and the strongest
evidence for loss of imprinting was demonstrated in tumor suppressor genes DLK1, 
PLAGL1, SLC22A18, TP73, and WT1. Differential expression of these five genes in
prostate tumor versus normal tissue using array data from a publicly available
database were consistent with the observed LOI patterns, and WT1 hypermethylation
was confirmed using quantitative DNA methylation analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest a more widespread dysregulation of 
genetic imprinting in prostate cancer than previously reported and warrant
further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as sunitinib and pazopanib
display their efficacy in a variety of solid tumours. However, their use in
therapy is limited by the lack of evidence about the ability to induce cell death
in cancer cells. Our aim was to evaluate cytotoxic effects induced by sunitinib
and pazopanib in 5637 and J82 bladder cancer cell lines.
METHODS: Cell viability was tested by MTT assay. Autophagy was evaluated by
western blot using anti-LC3 and anti-p62 antibodies, acridine orange staining and
FACS analysis. Oxygen radical generation and necrosis were determined by FACS
analysis using DCFDA and PI staining. Cathepsin B activation was evaluated by
western blot and fluorogenic Z-Arg-Arg-AMC peptide. Finally, gene expression was 
performed using RT-PCR Profiler array.
RESULTS: We found that sunitinib treatment for 24 h triggers incomplete
autophagy, impairs cathepsin B activation and stimulates a lysosomal-dependent
necrosis. By contrast, treatment for 48 h with pazopanib induces cathepsin B
activation and autophagic cell death, markedly reversed by CA074-Me and 3-MA,
cathepsin B and autophagic inhibitors, respectively. Finally, pazopanib
upregulates the a-glucosidase and downregulates the TP73 mRNA expression.
CONCLUSION: Our results showing distinct cell death mechanisms activated by
different TKIs, provide the biological basis for novel molecularly targeted
approaches.

We studied the comprehensive DNA methylation status in the naturally derived
gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SNU-719, which was infected with the
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by methylated CpG island recovery on chip assay. To
identify genes specifically methylated in EBV-associated gastric carcinomas
(EBVaGC), we focused on seven genes, TP73, BLU, FSD1, BCL7A, MARK1, SCRN1, and
NKX3.1, based on the results of methylated CpG island recovery on chip assay. We 
confirmed DNA methylation of the genes by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite 
sequencing in SNU-719. The expression of the genes, except for BCL7A, was
upregulated by a combination of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A
treatment in SNU-719. After the treatment, unmethylated DNA became detectable in 
all seven genes by methylation-specific PCR. We verified DNA methylation of the
genes in 75 primary gastric cancer tissues from 25 patients with EBVaGC and 50
EBV-negative patients who were controls. The methylation frequencies of TP73,
BLU, FSD1, BCL7A, MARK1, SCRN1, and NKX3.1 were significantly higher in EBVaGC
than in EBV-negative gastric carcinoma. We identified seven genes with promoter
regions that were specifically methylated in EBVaGC. Inactivation of these genes 
may suppress their function as tumor suppressor genes or tumor-associated
antigens and help to develop and maintain EBVaGC.

The p73 transcription factor is one of the members of the p53 family of tumor
suppressors with unique biological functions in processes like neurogenesis,
embryonic development and differentiation. For this reason, p73 activity is
tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including transcription and
post-translational modifications. Here, we identified a novel regulatory loop
between TAp73 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32).
TRIM32, a new direct p73 transcriptional target in the context of neural
progenitor cells, is differentially regulated by p73. Although TAp73 binds to the
TRIM32 promoter and activates its expression, TAp73-induced TRIM32 expression is 
efficiently repressed by DNp73. TRIM32 in turn physically interacts with TAp73
and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation, impairing p73-dependent
transcriptional activity. This mutual regulation between p73 and TRIM32
constitutes a novel feedback loop, which might have important implications in
central nervous system development as well as relevance in oncogenesis, and thus 
emerges as a possible therapeutic target.

University School of Medicine, Xi'an 710061, People's Republic of China.

Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies and remains the second
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Over 70% of new cases and deaths
occur in developing countries. In the early years of the molecular biology
revolution, cancer research mainly focuses on genetic alterations, including
gastric cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for normal development and
maintenance of tissue-specific gene expression patterns in mammals. Disruption of
epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular
transformation. Recent advancements in the rapidly evolving field of cancer
epigenetics have shown extensive reprogramming of every component of the
epigenetic machinery in cancer, including DNA methylation, histone modifications,
nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. Aberrant DNA methylation
in the promoter regions of gene, which leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor 
and other cancer-related genes in cancer cells, is the most well-defined
epigenetic hallmark in gastric cancer. The advantages of gene methylation as a
target for detection and diagnosis of cancer in biopsy specimens and non-invasive
body fluids such as serum and gastric washes have led to many studies of
application in gastric cancer. This review focuses on the most common and
important phenomenon of epigenetics, DNA methylation, in gastric cancer and
illustrates the impact epigenetics has had on this field.

Campinas, Piracicaba, SP, Brasil. mariano@fcm.unicamp.br

BACKGROUND: Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA) is a malignant salivary gland
tumor that arises rarely in the minor salivary glands. Although the etiology of
CXPA remains unclear, the role of some tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in
CXPA is documented; however, other genes still need to be studied.
STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE: An uncommon case of CXPA involving the upper lip is
presented, which was analyzed by a panel of tumor suppressor genes by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification.
RESULTS: The genes investigated in this study, a loss of copy number was detected
for CASP8, CD44, CDH1, DAPK1, ESR1, RASSF1, and TP73. Immunohistochemical
reactions for the validation of some of these results showed negativity for CD44,
RASSF1, and p73.
CONCLUSION: A loss of copy number of the genes CD44, RASSF1, and TP73 may
contribute to the carcinogenesis of CXPAs.

TAp73ß-mediated suppression of cell migration requires p57Kip2 control of actin
cytoskeleton dynamics.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Centrum Karolinska, Karolinska
Institutet, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.

The TP73 gene, a member of the p53 family, due to the use of different promoters 
and alternative splicing, is transcribed into different isoforms with contrasting
attributes and which contribute to its functional diversity. Considerable efforts
are made to identify the functional diversity of the p73 splicing variants during
tumorigenesis. TAp73a and TAp73ß isoforms have been shown to differentially
regulate cell cycle progression, differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly, a 
particular increase in expression of the TAp73 isoform, in favor of the a
splicing variant, has been reported in multiple tumour types. Here, we report a
distinctive role for TAp73ß isoform in the control of cell migration and
invasion. In fact, TAp73ß- dependent induction of p57(Kip2) expression accounted 
for inhibitory effects on the actin cytoskeleton dynamics and thereby cancer cell
motility. In contrast, TAp73a is not able to induce p57(Kip2) expression, and
exhibits a positive effect on actin cytoskeleton dynamics as well as cell
migration and invasion. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect on cell migration
and invasion of TAp73ß would qualify this distinct p73 isoform as tumor
suppressor gene. In contrast, the promoting effect of TAp73a on cell motility and
invasion strengthens the potential oncogenic activities of this p73 isoform.

Androgen receptor-induced tumor suppressor, KLLN, inhibits breast cancer growth
and transcriptionally activates p53/p73-mediated apoptosis in breast carcinomas.

Author information: 
(1)Genomic Medicine Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

Androgen receptor (AR) expression by immunohistochemistry correlates with better 
prognosis and survival among breast cancer patients. We and others have shown
that AR inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
However, the mechanism of AR's anti-tumor effect in breast cancer is still not
fully understood. Our recent study indicates that AR upregulates expression of
tumor suppressor gene PTEN by promoter activation in breast cancer. KLLN,
encoding KLLN protein, is a newly identified gene, which shares a bidirectional
promoter with PTEN and is transcribed in the opposite direction. So far, the
function of KLLN has never been studied in tumorigenesis. Here, we define KLLN as
a tumor suppressor in breast carcinomas, which inhibits tumor growth and
invasiveness. After analyzing 188 normal breast and 1247 malignant breast cancer 
tissues, we observed the loss of KLLN in multiple breast cancer subtypes and this
decreased KLLN expression associates with tumor progression and increasing
histological grade in invasive carcinomas. We characterize KLLN, for the first
time, as a transcription factor, directly promoting the expression of TP53 and
TP73, with consequent elevated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer
cells. We demonstrate, in vitro and in murine xenograph models, that both KLLN
and PTEN are AR-target genes, mediating androgen-induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our observations suggest that KLLN might be
used as a potential prognostic marker and novel therapy target for breast
carcinomas.

Medicine, 715 Albany Street, Boston, MA 02118, USA.

BACKGROUND: P73 belongs to the p53 family of cell survival regulators with the
corresponding locus Trp73 producing the N-terminally distinct isoforms, TAp73 and
DeltaNp73. Recently, two studies have implicated the murine Trp73 in the
modulation in phospho-tau accumulation in aged wild type mice and in young mice
modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggesting that Trp73, particularly the
DeltaNp73 isoform, links the accumulation of amyloid peptides to the creation of 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Here, we reevaluated tau pathologies in the same 
TgCRND8 mouse model as the previous studies.
RESULTS: Despite the use of the same animal models, our in vivo studies failed to
demonstrate biochemical or histological evidence for misprocessing of tau in
young compound Trp73+/- + TgCRND8 mice or in aged Trp73+/- mice analyzed at the
ages reported previously, or older. Secondly, we analyzed an additional mouse
model where the DeltaNp73 was specifically deleted and confirmed a lack of impact
of the DeltaNp73 allele, either in heterozygous or homozygous form, upon tau
pathology in aged mice. Lastly, we also examined human TP73 for single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or copy number variants in a meta-analysis of 10 AD
genome-wide association datasets. No SNPs reached significance after correction
for multiple testing and no duplications/deletions in TP73 were found in 549
cases of AD and 544 non-demented controls.
CONCLUSION: Our results fail to support P73 as a contributor to AD pathogenesis.

Transcription factor KLLN inhibits tumor growth by AR suppression, induces
apoptosis by TP53/TP73 stimulation in prostate carcinomas, and correlates with
cellular differentiation.

Wang Y(1), Radhakrishnan D, He X, Peehl DM, Eng C.

Author information: 
(1)Genomic Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.

CONTEXT: KLLN is a newly identified gene with unknown function and shares a
bidirectional promoter with PTEN.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between
KILLIN (KLLN) expression and prostate cancer and the potential tumor suppressive 
effect.
DESIGN: We conducted an in silico analysis to compare KLLN expression in normal
prostate and matched primary carcinoma tissues. We subsequently used
immunohistochemistry to examine KLLN expression and association with Gleason
grade and score in 109 prostatectomy samples. KLLN's tumor-suppressive effect was
studied in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cell models.
PATIENTS: Patients were diagnosed with peripheral zone prostate carcinomas
without metastasis at the time of prostatectomy. Each patient's primary tumor
comprised at least 2 tumoral regions with different Gleason grades.
RESULTS: KLLN expression decreased from normal prostate tissue to primary
carcinomas (P < .0001). The loss of epithelial and stromal KLLN expression is
associated with poor differentiation and high Gleason scores (P < .0001),
consistent with our in vitro observation that KLLN inhibits tumor cell
proliferation and invasiveness. KLLN decreases prostate-specific antigen levels
and suppresses androgen-mediated cell growth by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR)
transcription. As an androgen receptor-regulated target, KLLN also functions as a
transcriptional activator, directly promoting the expression of TP53 and TP73,
with consequent elevated apoptosis, regardless of AR status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that KLLN is a transcription factor
directly regulating AR, TP53, and TP73 expression, with a role in prostate
carcinogenesis. Loss of KLLN associates with high Gleason scores, suggesting that
KLLN might be used as a potential prognostic marker for risk management and as a 
novel therapy target for advanced prostate carcinomas.

molecular targeted agent, suppresses survivin, which is overexpressed in many
tumor types. The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of
YM155 in SK-NEP-1 cells.
METHODS: SK-NEP-1 cell growth in vitro and in vivo was assessed by MTT and nude
mice experiments. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric
analysis was used to detect apoptosis in cell culture. Then gene expression
profile of tumor cells treated with YM155 was analyzed with real-time PCR arrays.
We then analyzed the expression data with MEV (Multi Experiment View) cluster
software. Datasets representing genes with altered expression profile derived
from cluster analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool.
RESULTS: YM155 treatment resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation of
SK-NEP-1cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V assay, cell cycle, and
activation of caspase-3 demonstrates that YM155 induced apoptosis in SK-NEP-1
cells. YM155 significantly inhibited growth of SK-NEP-1 xenografts (YM155 5
mg/kg: 1.45 ± 0.77 cm3; YM155 10 mg/kg: 0.95 ± 0.55 cm3) compared to DMSO group
(DMSO: 3.70 ± 2.4 cm3) or PBS group cells (PBS: 3.78 ± 2.20 cm3, ANOVA P < 0.01).
YM155 treatment decreased weight of tumors (YM155 5 mg/kg: 1.05 ± 0.24 g; YM155
10 mg/kg: 0.72 ± 0.17 g) compared to DMSO group (DMSO: 2.06 ± 0.38 g) or PBS
group cells (PBS: 2.36 ± 0.43 g, ANOVA P < 0.01). Real-time PCR array analysis
showed between Test group and control group there are 32 genes significantly
up-regulated and 54 genes were significantly down-regulated after YM155
treatment. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed cell death was the highest
rated network with 65 focus molecules and the significance score of 44. The IPA
analysis also groups the differentially expressed genes into biological
mechanisms that are related to cell death, cellular function maintenance, cell
morphology, carbohydrate metabolism and cellular growth and proliferation. Death 
receptor signaling (3.87E-19), TNFR1 signaling, induction of apoptosis by HIV1,
apoptosis signaling and molecular mechanisms of cancer came out to be the top
four most significant pathways. IPA analysis also showed top molecules
up-regulated were BBC3, BIRC3, BIRC8, BNIP1, CASP7, CASP9, CD5, CDKN1A, CEBPG and
COL4A3, top molecules down-regulated were ZNF443, UTP11L, TP73, TNFSF10,
TNFRSF1B, TNFRSF25, TIAF1, STK17A, SST and SPP1, upstream regulator were NR3C1,
TP53, dexamethasone , TNF and Akt.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that YM155 treatment resulted in
apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells. YM155 had
significant role and little side effect in the treatment of SK-NEP-1 xenograft
tumors. Real-time PCR array analysis firstly showed expression profile of genes
dyes-regulated after YM155 treatment. IPA analysis also represents new molecule
mechanism of YM155 treatment, such as NR3C1 and dexamethasone may be new target
of YM155. And our results may provide new clues of molecular mechanism of
apoptosis induced by YM155.

Faculty;

Aberrant methylation of gene promoter regions is one of the mechanisms for
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human malignancies. In this study, the 
methylation pattern of 24 tumor suppressor genes was analyzed in 75 samples of
ovarian cancer using the methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplification (MS-MLPA) assay. Of the 24 tumor suppressor genes examined,
aberrant methylation was observed in 17. The three most frequently methylated
genes were CDKN2B, CDH13 and RASSF1, followed by ESR1 and MLH1. Methylation
frequencies ranged from 1.3% for CDKN2A, RARß, CASP8, VHL and TP73 to 24% for
CDKN2B. The corresponding normal DNA from each patient was also investigated.
Methylation was detected in tumors, although not in normal tissues, with the
exception of two samples, indicating aberrant methylation in tumors. Clear cell
carcinoma samples exhibited a higher frequency of CDKN2B promoter
hypermethylation compared to those of other histological types (P=0.05). Our data
indicate that methylation of the CDKN2B gene is a frequent event in ovarian
carcinogenesis and that analysis of only three genes is sufficient to detect the 
presence of methylation in 35% of ovarian cancer cases. However, more studies
using a much larger sample size are needed to define the potential role of DNA
methylation as a marker for ovarian cancer.

Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.

Exposure to light at night through shiftwork has been linked to alterations in
DNA methylation and increased risk of cancer development. Using an Illumina
Infinium Methylation Assay, we analyzed methylation levels of 397 CpG sites in
the promoter regions of 56 normally imprinted genes to investigate whether
shiftwork is associated with alteration of methylation patterns. Methylation was 
significantly higher at 20 CpG sites and significantly lower at 30 CpG sites (P <
0.05) in 10 female long-term shiftworkers as compared to 10 female age- and
folate intake-matched day workers. The strongest evidence for altered methylation
patterns in shiftworkers was observed for DLX5, IGF2AS, and TP73 based on the
magnitude of methylation change and consistency in the direction of change across
multiple CpG sites, and consistent results were observed using quantitative DNA
methylation analysis. We conclude that long-term shiftwork may alter methylation 
patterns at imprinted genes, which may be an important mechanism by which
shiftwork has carcinogenic potential and warrants further investigation.

The TP53 signaling network in mammals and worms.

Jolliffe AK(1), Derry WB.

Author information: 
(1)The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto, ON, Canada.

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been an invaluable model organism
for studying the molecular mechanisms that govern cell fate, from fundamental
aspects of multicellular development to programmed cell death (apoptosis). The
transparency of this organism permits visualization of cells in living animals at
high resolution. The powerful genetics and functional genomics tools available in
C. elegans allow for detailed analysis of gene function, including genes that are
frequently deregulated in human diseases such as cancer. The TP53 protein is a
critical suppressor of tumor formation in vertebrates, and the TP53 gene is
mutated in over 50% of human cancers. TP53 suppresses malignancy by integrating a
variety of cellular stresses that direct it to activate transcription of genes
that help to repair the damage or trigger apoptotic death if the damage is beyond
repair. The TP53 paralogs, TP63 and TP73, have distinct roles in development as
well as overlapping functions with TP53 in apoptosis and repair, which
complicates their analysis in vertebrates. C. elegans contains a single TP53
family member, cep-1, that shares properties of all three vertebrate genes and
thus offers a simple system in which to study the biological functions of this
important gene family. This review summarizes major advances in our understanding
of the TP53 family using C. elegans as a model organism.

ABL regulation by AXL promotes cisplatin resistance in esophageal cancer.

Hong J(1), Peng D, Chen Z, Sehdev V, Belkhiri A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN
37232, USA.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is characterized by resistance to chemotherapy
and poor outcome. Although cisplatin (CDDP) has been used as a first-line therapy
in patients with EAC, resistance remains a major clinical problem. The AXL
receptor tyrosine kinase, originally isolated as a transforming gene from
leukemia, is overexpressed in several solid tumors. Herein, we assessed AXL
protein expression in human EACs and examined its role in CDDP resistance in
human EAC cells. AXL overexpression was detected in more than 50% of tumors
examined. Elevating AXL in nonoverexpressing cells doubled the CDDP IC(50) and
increased cell survival three-fold, while attenuating AXL in overexpressing cells
reduced survival two-fold. The effects of AXL modulation on cell survival were
associated with changes in cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that AXL blocked CDDP-induced activation of
endogenous p73ß (TP73), reducing its protein half-life, and inhibited
CDDP-induced levels of p-c-ABL(Y412) and p-p73ß(Y99). These changes were
associated with a disruption of c-ABL/p73ß protein interactions due to
association with c-ABL in the cytoplasm, thereby blocking nuclear accumulation of
c-ABL and phosphorylation of p73ß in response to DNA damage. Together, our
results establish that AXL promotes CDDP resistance in esophageal adenocarcinoma 
and argue that therapeutic targeting of AXL may sensitize these cancers to
DNA-damaging drugs.

Author information:

Alegre, Brazil.

The p53 family and its regulatory pathway play an important role as regulators of
developmental processes, limiting the propagation of aneuploid cells. Its
dysfunction or imbalance can lead to pathological abnormalities in humans. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal polymorphisms TP53
c.215G>C (P72R), TP73 4 c.-30G>A and 14 c.-20C>T, MDM2 c.14+309T>G (SNP309), MDM4
c.753+572C>T and USP7 c.2719-234G>A as risk factors for Down Syndrome (DS) birth.
A case-control study was conducted with 263 mothers of DS children and 196
control mothers. The distribution of these genotypic variants was similar between
case and control mothers. However, the combined alleles TP53 C and MDM2 G, and
P53 C and USP7 A increased the risk of having offspring with DS (OR=1.84 and
1.77; 95% CI; P < 0.007 and 0.018, respectively). These results suggest that,
although the individual polymorphisms were not associated with DS birth, the
effect of the combined genotypes among TP53, MDM2 and USP7 genes indicates a
possible role of TP53 and its regulatory pathway as a risk factor for aneuploidy.

Quantitative global and gene-specific promoter methylation in relation to
biological properties of neuroblastomas.

Kiss NB(1), Kogner P, Johnsen JI, Martinsson T, Larsson C, Geli J.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Stockholm, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: In this study we aimed to quantify tumor suppressor gene (TSG)
promoter methylation densities levels in primary neuroblastoma tumors and cell
lines. A subset of these TSGs is associated with a CpG island methylator
phenotype (CIMP) in other tumor types.
METHODS: The study panel consisted of 38 primary tumors, 7 established cell lines
and 4 healthy references. Promoter methylation was determined by bisulphate
Pyrosequencing for 14 TSGs; and LINE-1 repeat element methylation was used as an 
indicator of global methylation levels.
RESULTS: Overall mean TSG Z-scores were significantly increased in cases with
adverse outcome, but were unrelated to global LINE-1 methylation. CIMP with
hypermethylation of three or more gene promoters was observed in 6/38 tumors and 
7/7 cell lines. Hypermethylation of one or more TSG (comprising TSGs BLU, CASP8, 
DCR2, CDH1, RASSF1A and RASSF2) was evident in 30/38 tumors. By contrast only
very low levels of promoter methylation were recorded for APC, DAPK1, NORE1A,
P14, P16, TP73, PTEN and RARB. Similar involvements of methylation instability
were revealed between cell line models and neuroblastoma tumors. Separate
analysis of two proposed CASP8 regulatory regions revealed frequent and
significant involvement of CpG sites between exon 4 and 5, but modest involvement
of the exon 1 region.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results highlight the involvement of TSG
methylation instability in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines using quantitative
methods, support the use of DNA methylation analyses as a prognostic tool for
this tumor type, and underscore the relevance of developing demethylating
therapies for its treatment.

To examine the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration in
hepatocarcinogenesis, a systematic comparative study of both tumor and their
corresponding non-tumor derived tissue has been conducted in a cohort of 60 HBV
associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. By using Alu-polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and ligation-mediated PCR, 233 viral-host junctions mapped across 
all human chromosomes at random, no difference between tumor and non-tumor tissue
was observed, with the exception of fragile sites (P = 0.0070). HBV insertions in
close proximity to cancer related genes such as hTERT were found in this study,
however overall they were rare events. No direct correlation between chromosome
aberrations and the number of HBV integration events was found using a sensitive 
array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) assay. However, a positive
correlation was observed between the status of several tumor suppressor genes
(TP53, RB1, CDNK2A and TP73) and the number of chromosome aberrations (r =
0.6625, P = 0.0003). Examination of the viral genome revealed that 43% of inserts
were in the preC/C region and 57% were in the HBV X gene. Strikingly,
approximately 24% of the integrations examined had a breakpoint in a short 15 nt 
viral genome region (1820-1834 nt). As a consequence, all of the confirmed X gene
insertions were C-terminal truncated, losing their growth-suppressive domain.
However, the same pattern of X gene C-terminal truncation was found in both tumor
and non-tumor derived samples. Furthermore, the integrated viral sequences in
both groups had a similar low frequency of C1653T, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A
mutations. The frequency and patterns of HBV insertions were similar between
tumor and their adjacent non-tumor samples indicating that the majority of HBV
DNA integration events are not associated with hepatocarcinogenesis.

Phospho-<U+0394>Np63a/SREBF1 protein interactions: bridging cell metabolism and
cisplatin chemoresistance.

Tumor protein (TP)-p53 family members (TP63, TP63 and TP73) are guardians of the 
genome and key players in orchestrating the cellular response to cisplatin
treatment. Cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a was shown to have a role
in regulating intracellular <U+0394>Np63a protein levels. We previously found that
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells exposed to cisplatin displayed the
ATM-dependent phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a (p-<U+0394>Np63a), which is critical for the
transcriptional regulation of specific downstream mRNAs and microRNAs and is
likely to underlie the chemoresistance of SCC cells. However, SCC cells
expressing non-p-<U+0394>Np63a became more cisplatin-resistant. We also found that
p-<U+0394>Np63a forms complexes with a number of proteins involved in cell death
response through regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, RNA
splicing and chromatin modifications. Here, we showed that p-<U+0394>Np63a induced ARG1,
GAPDH, and CPT2 gene transcription in cisplatin-sensitive SCC cells, while
non-p-<U+0394>Np63a increased a transcription of CAD, G6PD and FASN genes in
cisplatin-resistant SCC cells. We report that the p-<U+0394>Np63a-dependent regulatory
mechanisms implicated in the modulation of plethora of pathways, including amino 
acid, carbohydrate, lipid and nucleotide metabolisms, thereby affect tumor cell
response to cisplatin-induced cell death, suggesting that the ATM-dependent
<U+0394>Np63a pathway plays a role in the resistance of tumor cells to platinum therapy.

Breast carcinogenesis is a multistep process that involves both genetic and
epigenetic alterations. Identification of aberrantly methylated genes in breast
tumors and their relation to clinical parameters can contribute to improved
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision making. Our objective in the
present study was to identify the methylation status of 34 cancer-involved genes 
in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). Each of the 70 IDC cases analyzed had a
unique methylation profile. The highest methylation frequency was detected in the
WT1 (95.7%) and RASSF1 (71.4%) genes. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed
three clusters with different distribution of the prognostic factors tumor grade,
lymph node metastasis, and proliferation rate. Methylation of TP73 was associated
with high histological grade and high proliferation rate; methylation of RARB was
associated with lymph node metastasis. Concurrent methylation of TP73 and RARB
was associated with high histological grade, high proliferation rate, increased
tumor size, and lymph node metastasis. Patients with more than six methylated
genes had higher rates of relapse events and cancer deaths. In multivariate
analysis, TP73 methylation and the methylation index were associated with disease
outcome. Our results indicate that methylation index and methylation of TP73
and/or RARB are related to unfavorable prognostic factors in patients with IDC.
These epigenetic markers should be validated in further studies to improve breast
cancer management.

Genetic alterations of WWOX in Wilms' tumor are involved in its carcinogenesis.

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 16q appears in ~20-30% cases of Wilms' tumor.
Within this region, known as common fragile site FRA16D, the WWOX tumor
suppressor gene is located. Abnormalities of WWOX gene expression levels were
observed in many tumor types and were associated with worse prognosis. The
purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the WWOX tumor suppressor
gene in Wilms' tumor samples. We evaluated the correlation between expression of 
WWOX and genes involved in proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (BCL2, BAX), signal
transduction (ERBB4, ERBB2, EGFR), cell cycle (CCNE1, CCND1), cell adhesion
(CDH1) and transcription (TP73) using real-time RT-PCR in 23 tumor samples. We
also analyzed the potential causes of WWOX gene expression reduction i.e.,
promoter methylation status (MethylScreen method) and loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) status. We revealed a positive correlation between WWOX expression and
BCL2, BCL2/BAX ratio, EGFR, ERBB4 isoform JM-a, TP73 and negative correlation
with both cyclins. Loss of heterozygosity of the WWOX gene was observed only at
intron 8, however, it had no influence on the reduction of its expression levels.
Contrary to LOH, methylation of the region covering the 3' end of the promoter
and part of exon 1 was associated with statistically significant reduction of
WWOX gene expression levels. In the present study we reveal that in Wilms' tumors
the WWOX expression levels are positively associated with the process of
apoptosis, signal transduction through the ErbB4 pathway and EGFR and negatively 
with the regulation of the cell cycle (by cyclin E1 and D1). Moreover, our
analysis indicates that in this type of tumor the expression of the WWOX gene can
be regulated by an epigenetic mechanism--its promoter methylation.

Early apoptosis signals induced by a low dose of epigallocatechin 3-gallate
interfere with apoptotic and cell death pathways.

Research for natural compounds with novel advantageous biological activities or
antineoplastic potential is an important issue in drug discovery. An example of
this type of compound is epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), which is the major
polyphenol in green tea. EGCG has therapeutic effects and modulates multiple
metabolic pathways, including apoptosis. The present study evaluates the effect
of 10 microM EGCG on the expression of genes that are involved in apoptosis and
cell death using PCR-array technology and HeLa cells as an in vitro model. The
specific modulatory effects of EGCG were demonstrated by significant alterations 
in the expression levels of the following genes that control the apoptosis
pathway: the TNF receptor and its ligand family, the death effector domain
family, the Bcl-2 family or TP73. The structure of EGCG suggests that it has the 
potential to be an anticancer agent and that EGCG serves as a promising starting 
point for the derivation of novel anticancer drugs. EGCC metabolite products,
such as pyrogallol, gallic acid or quinones, may also play important roles in
inducing apoptosis. Therefore, quantification of mRNA using PCR-array technology 
is a valuable tool for screening these anticarcinogenic compounds. By evaluating 
the action of EGCG on genes that regulate apoptosis, our results suggest that
EGCG is as an activator of gene expression with direct implications in cancer
therapy. In addition, the limited success in activation of the antiapoptotic gene
Bcl-2 may be associated with resistance to cancer treatment.

Molecular characteristics and chromatin texture features in acute promyelocytic
leukemia.

FF, Metze K, Lorand-Metze I.

Author information: 
(1)State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a cytogenetically well defined
entity. Nevertheless, some features observed at diagnosis are related to a worse 
outcome of the patients.
METHODS: In a prospective study, we analyzed peripheral (PB) leukocyte count,
immunophenotype, methylation status of CDKN2B, CDKN2A and TP73; FLT3 and NPM1
mutations besides nuclear chromatin texture characteristics of the leukemic
cells. We also examined the relation of these features with patient's outcome.
RESULTS: Among 19 cases, 4 had a microgranular morphology, 7 presented PB
leukocytes >10x109/l, 2 had FLT3-ITD and 3 had FLT3-TKD (all three presenting a
methylated CDKN2B). NPM1 mutation was not observed. PB leukocyte count showed an 
inverse relation with standard deviation of gray levels, contrast, cluster
prominence, and chromatin fractal dimension (FD). Cases with FLT3-ITD presented a
microgranular morphology, PB leukocytosis and expression of HLA-DR, CD34 and
CD11b. Concerning nuclear chromatin texture variables, these cases had a lower
entropy, contrast, cluster prominence and FD, but higher local homogeneity, and
R245, in keeping with more homogeneously distributed chromatin. In the univariate
Cox analysis, a higher leukocyte count, FLT3-ITD mutation, microgranular
morphology, methylation of CDKN2B, besides a higher local homogeneity of nuclear 
chromatin, a lower chromatin entropy and FD were associated to a worse outcome.
All these features lost significance when the cases were stratified for FLT3-ITD 
mutation. Methylation status of CDNK2A and TP73 showed no relation to patient's
survival.
CONCLUSION: in APL, patients with FLT3-ITD mutation show different clinical
characteristics and have blasts with a more homogeneous chromatin texture.
Texture analysis demonstrated that FLTD-ITD was accompanied not only by different
cytoplasmic features, but also by a change in chromatin structure in routine
cytologic preparations. Yet we were not able to detect chromatin changes by
nuclear texture analysis of patients with the FTLD-TKD or methylation of specific
genes.

Hearing loss is the most common symptom in patients with vestibular schwannoma
(VS). In the past, compressive mechanisms caused by the tumoral mass and its
growth have been regarded as the most likely causes of the hearing loss
associated with VS. Interestingly, new evidence proposes molecular mechanisms as 
an explanation for such hearing loss. Among the molecular mechanisms proposed are
methylation of TP73, negative expression of cyclin D1, expression of B7-H1,
increased expression of the platelet-derived growth factor A, underexpression of 
PEX5L, RAD54B, and PSMAL, and overexpression of CEA. Many molecular mechanisms
are involved in vestibular schwannoma development; we review some of these
mechanisms with special emphasis on hearing loss associated with vestibular
schwannoma.

For an identification of novel candidate genes in thyroid tumourigenesis, we have
investigated gene copy number changes in a Trk-T1 transgenic mouse model of
thyroid neoplasia. For this aim, 30 thyroid tumours from Trk-T1 transgenics were 
investigated by comparative genomic hybridisation. Recurrent gene copy number
alterations were identified and genes located in the altered chromosomal regions 
were analysed by Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis in order to reveal gene
functions potentially associated with thyroid tumourigenesis. In thyroid
neoplasms from Trk-T1 mice, a recurrent gain on chromosomal bands 1C4-E2.3 (10.0%
of cases), and losses on 3H1-H3 (13.3%), 4D2.3-E2 (43.3%) and 14E4-E5 (6.7%) were
identified. The genes Twist2, Ptma, Pde6d, Bmpr1b, Pdlim5, Unc5c, Srm, Trp73,
Ythdf2, Taf12 and Slitrk5 are located in these chromosomal bands. Copy number
changes of these genes were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridisation on 30
human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples and altered gene expression was
studied by qRT-PCR analyses in 67 human PTC. Copy number gains were detected in
83% of cases for TWIST2 and in 100% of cases for PTMA and PDE6D. DNA losses of
SLITRK1 and SLITRK5 were observed in 21% of cases and of SLITRK6 in 16% of cases.
Gene expression was significantly up-regulated for UNC5C and TP73 and
significantly down-regulated for SLITRK5 in tumours compared with normal tissue. 
In conclusion, a global genomic copy number analysis of thyroid tumours from
Trk-T1 transgenic mice revealed a number of novel gene alterations in thyroid
tumourigenesis that are also prevalent in human PTCs.

Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. Two
step inactivation of RB1 (M1-M2) represents the key event in the pathogenesis of 
retinoblastoma but additional genetic and epigenetic events (M3-Mn) are required 
for tumor development. In the present study, we employed Methylation Specific
Multiplex Ligation Probe Assay to investigate methylation status and copy number 
changes of 25 and 39 oncosuppressor genes, respectively. This technique was
applied to analyse 12 retinoblastomas (5 bilateral and 7 unilateral) and results 
were compared to corresponding normal retina. We identified hypermethylation in
seven new genes: MSH6 (50%), CD44 (42%), PAX5 (42%), GATA5 (25%), TP53 (8%), VHL 
(8%) and GSTP1 (8%) and we confirmed the previously reported hypermethylation of 
MGMT (58%), RB1 (17%) and CDKN2 (8%). These genes belong to key pathways
including DNA repair, pRB and p53 signalling, transcriptional regulation, protein
degradation, cell-cell interaction, cellular adhesion and migration. In the same 
group of retinoblastomas, a total of 29 copy number changes (19 duplications and 
10 deletions) have been identified. Interestingly, we found deletions of the
following oncosuppressor genes that might contribute to drive retinoblastoma
tumorigenesis: TP53, CDH13, GATA5, CHFR, TP73 and IGSF4. The present data
highlight the importance of epigenetic changes in retinoblastoma and indicate
seven hypermethylated oncosuppressors never associated before to retinoblastoma
pathogenesis. This study also confirms the presence of copy number variations in 
retinoblastoma, expecially in unilateral cases (mean 3 ± 1.3) where these changes
were found more frequently respect to bilateral cases (mean 1.4 ± 1.1).

The present experiments were aimed to characterize in immortalized human HaCat
keratinocytes the gene expression induced by paraquat and capsaicin, two agents
known to induce cell death or to affect inflammatory and pain pathways,
respectively. In particular, the following set of genes were analysed by
qRealtime PCR: CXCL10,CXCL11, IL-10 (inflammatory and immune responses), TP73,
BCL2, (apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes), MMP9 (proteolysis), SOD-1, BAK-1 and 
CAT (peroxysomal and microsomal oxidation pathways). In this way, we were able to
differentiate the two toxins since they had a different profile of gene
expression. In fact, paraquata was found to activate set of genes involved in
inflammatory (CXL10,CXL11 and IL-10), and cell death (BCL2, BAK-1, MMP9)
pathways. Another specific site of action of paraquat was represented by an
activation of the gene involved in SOD-1 transcription. On the contrary,
capsaicin was found to produce only an up-regulation of BCL2, an anti-apoptotic
gene and MMP9, whereas no significant changes were reported in genes involved in 
inflammatory and immune responses. Finally, in comparison to previous experiments
carried out with TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, we have shown that paraquat produced a
similar pattern of activation of set of genes involved both in inflammation and
apoptosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to characterize 81 cases of
myeloid and lymphoid malignancies with cytogenetic 1p36 alterations not affecting
the PRDM16 locus. In total, three subgroups were identified: balanced
translocations (N<U+200A>=<U+200A>27) and telomeric rearrangements (N<U+200A>=<U+200A>15), both mainly
observed in myeloid disorders; and unbalanced non-telomeric rearrangements
(N<U+200A>=<U+200A>39), mainly observed in lymphoid proliferations and frequently associated
with a highly complex karyotype. The 1p36 rearrangement was isolated in 12 cases,
mainly myeloid disorders. The breakpoints on 1p36 were more widely distributed
than previously reported, but with identifiable rare breakpoint cluster regions, 
such as the TP73 locus. We also found novel partner loci on 1p36 for the known
multi-partner genes HMGA2 and RUNX1. We precised the common terminal 1p36
deletion, which has been suggested to have an adverse prognosis, in B-cell
lymphomas [follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with
t(14;18)(q32;q21) as well as follicular lymphomas without t(14;18)].
Intrachromosomal telomeric repetitive sequences were detected in at least half
the cases of telomeric rearrangements. It is unclear how the latter
rearrangements occurred and whether they represent oncogenic events or result
from chromosomal instability during oncogenesis.

Center, 1255 Light Hall, 2215 Garland Avenue, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.

TP53, TP63, and TP73 genes comprise the p53 family. Each gene produces protein
isoforms through multiple mechanisms including extensive alternative mRNA
splicing. Accumulating evidence shows that these isoforms play a critical role in
the regulation of many biological processes in normal cells. Their abnormal
expression contributes to tumorigenesis and has a profound effect on tumor
response to curative therapy. This paper is an overview of isoform diversity in
the p53 family and its role in cancer.

Cell cycle progression contributes to the cellular response to DNA-damaging
factors, such as chemotherapy and radiation. We hypothesized that the genetic
variations in cell cycle pathway genes may modulate treatment responses and
affect survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We 
genotyped 374 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 49 cell cycle-related
genes in 598 patients with stages III-IV NSCLC treated with first-line
platinum-based chemotherapy with/without radiation. We analyzed the individual
and combined associations of these SNPs with survival and evaluated their
gene-gene interactions using survival tree analysis. In the analysis of survival 
in all the patients, 39 SNPs reached nominal significance (P < 0.05) and 4 SNPs
were significant at P <0.01. However, none of these SNPs remained significant
after correction for multiple comparisons at a false discovery rate of 10%. In
stratified analysis by treatment modality, after adjusting for multiple
comparisons, nine SNPs in chemotherapy alone and one SNP in chemoradiation
remained significant. The most significant SNP in chemotherapy group was
CCNB2:rs1486878 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.25-2.30, P = 0.001]. TP73: rs3765701 was the only significant SNP in
chemoradiation group (HR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.35-2.59, P = 1.8 × 10(-4)). In
cumulative analysis, we found a significant gene-dosage effect in patients
receiving chemotherapy alone. Survival tree analysis demonstrated potential
higher order gene-gene and gene-treatment interactions, which could be used to
predict survival status based on distinct genetic signatures. These results
suggest that genetic variations in cell cycle pathway genes may affect the
survival of patients with stages III-IV NSCLC individually and jointly.

The TP53 tumour-suppressor gene is expressed as several protein isoforms
generated by different mechanisms, including use of alternative promoters,
splicing sites and translational initiation sites, that are conserved through
evolution and within the TP53 homologues, TP63 and TP73. Although first described
in the eighties, the importance of p53 isoforms in regulating the suppressive
functions of p53 has only become evident in the last 10 years, by analogy with
observations that p63 and p73 isoforms appeared indispensable to fully understand
the biological functions of TP63 and TP73. This review summarizes recent advances
in the field of 'p53 isoforms', including new data on p63 and p73 isoforms.
Details of the alternative mechanisms that produce p53 isoforms and cis- and
trans-regulators identified are provided. The main focus is on their biological
functions (apoptosis, cell cycle, aging and so on) in cellular and animal models,
including mouse, zebrafish and Drosophila. Finally, the deregulation of p53
isoform expression in human cancers is reviewed. Based on these latest results,
several developments are expected in the future: the identification of drugs
modulating p53 isoform expression; the generation of animal models and the
evaluation of the use of p53 isoform as biomarkers in human cancers.

Targeting p73 in cancer.

p73 is a member of the p53 family of tumor suppressors. Transactivating isoforms 
of p73 (TAp73) have p53-like, anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities
that are crucial for an efficient chemotherapy response. In line with this,
genetic studies in mice have confirmed that TAp73 acts as a tumor suppressor.
However, in contrast to p53, which is commonly inactivated in human cancer by
point mutations, the TP73 gene is almost never mutated. Instead, the tumor
suppressor activity of TAp73 is inhibited through a variety of mechanisms
including epigenetic silencing and complex formation with inhibitory proteins.
All these mechanisms have in common that they are in principle reversible and
therefore amenable to therapeutic intervention. Here, we will review how tumor
cells control the tumor suppressor activity of TAp73 and discuss possible
strategies targeting p73 for reactivation.

Skövde, Skövde, Sweden.

p73 can activate transcription of p53-responsive genes, thereby inhibiting cell
growth. An alternative promoter in the TP73 gene gives rise to an N-terminally
truncated isoform of p73, <U+0394>Np73, which lacks the transactivation domain of the
full length TAp73 protein. TAp73 is considered pro-apoptotic, and <U+0394>Np73
anti-apoptotic. In this study, we overexpressed <U+0394>Np73ß in p53 wild type and p53
mutant colon cancer cell lines and further exposed the cells to cancer
therapeutic drug cisplatin. The results showed that cisplatin decreased the
protein expression levels of <U+0394>Np73ß in a dose-dependent manner, and both TAp73
and p53 were upregulated after cisplatin treatment. Further, clonogenic potential
and cell viability were decreased, and apoptotic cells increased, in p53 mutant
and in p53 wild type cells. Cellular viability was significantly higher in
<U+0394>Np73ß-cells than mock-transfected cells. However, <U+0394>Np73ß overexpression did not 
affect the cellular susceptibility to cisplatin. In conclusion, the
overexpression of <U+0394>Np73ß increases viability in p53 wild type and p53 mutant
colon cancer cells, and cisplatin induces the degradation of <U+0394>Np73ß in a
dose-dependent manner.

PURPOSE: Cumulative data support the role of <U+0394>TAp73 variants in tumorigenic
processes such as drug resistance. We evaluate the impact of TP73 isoforms and
their putative target genes ABCB1, HMGB1, and CASP1 on the survival of colon
cancer patients and the correlation between their expressions.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined in 77 colon cancer patients the expression of 
<U+0394>Ex2p73, <U+0394>Ex2/3p73, <U+0394>Np73, TAp73, ABCB1, HMGB1, and CASP1 by quantitative
real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Tumor characteristics, disease-free
survival, and overall survival (OS) were examined in each patient. Functional
experiments were carried out to check whether ectopic expression of <U+0394>Np73
modifies the proliferation, drug resistance, migration, and invasion properties
of colon tumor cells and the expression of ABCB1, HMGB1, and CASP1.
RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed between the expression levels of
<U+0394>TAp73 variants and HMGB1. Furthermore, a trend was observed for ABCB1.
Overexpression of <U+0394>Ex2/3p73 and <U+0394>Np73 isoforms was significantly associated with 
advanced stages (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively) and predicted shortened OS 
(P = 0.04 and P = 0.05, respectively). High levels of ABCB1 and HMGB1 were
associated with shorter OS (P = 0.04 and P = 0.05, respectively). Multivariate
analysis showed that, in addition to the tumor stage, ABCB1 and HMGB1 had
independent relationships with OS (P = 0.008). Ectopic expression of <U+0394>Np73 was
associated with an increase in proliferation and drug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: The positive correlation between <U+0394>TAp73 variants and HMGB1 and ABCB1
expression supports them as TP73 targets. The fact that upregulation of <U+0394>TAp73
isoforms was associated with shortened OS, increase in proliferation, and drug
resistance confirms their oncogenic role and plausible value as prognostic
markers. ABCB1 and HMGB1, putative <U+0394>TAp73 target genes, strongly predict OS in an
independent manner, making clear the importance of studying downstream TP73
targets that could predict the outcome of colon cancer patients better than
<U+0394>TAp73 variants themselves do.

Aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands is a hallmark of human cancers and
is an early event in carcinogenesis. We examined whether promoter
hypermethylation contributes to the pathogenesis of benign breast lesions along a
progression continuum to invasive breast cancer. The exploratory study cohort
comprised 17 breast cancer patients with multiple benign and/or in situ lesions
concurrently present with invasive carcinoma within a tumor biopsy. DNA from
tumor tissue, normal breast epithelium when present, benign lesions
(fibroadenoma, hyperplasia, papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, 
atypical lobular hyperplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia), and in situ lesions
of lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma were interrogated for promoter
methylation status in 22 tumor suppressor genes using the multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). Methylation specific PCR 
was performed to confirm hypermethylation detected by MS-MLPA. Promoter
methylation was detected in 11/22 tumor suppressor genes in 16/17 cases.
Hypermethylation of RASSF1 was most frequent, present in 14/17 cases, followed by
APC in 12/17, and GSTP1 in 9/17 cases with establishment of an epigenetic
monocloncal progression continuum to invasive breast cancer. Hypermethylated
promoter regions in normal breast epithelium, benign, and premalignant lesions
within the same tumor biopsy implicate RASSF1, APC, GSTP1, TIMP3, CDKN2B, CDKN2A,
ESR1, CDH13, RARB, CASP8, and TP73 as early events. DNA hypermethylation
underlies thepathogenesis of step-wise transformation along a monoclonal
continuum from normal to preneoplasia to invasive breast cancer.

DNA repair plays a critical role in human cancers. We hypothesized that DNA
mismatch repair gene variants are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. We
retrospectively genotyped 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 13
mismatch repair related genes in 706 patients with pancreatic cancer and 706
cancer-free controls using the mass spectroscopy-based MassArray method.
Association of genotype with pancreatic cancer risk was tested by multivariate
logistic regression models. A significance level of P = 0.0015 was set at the
false discovery rate (FDR) <1% using the Beta-Uniform Mixture method. We found 28
SNPs related to altered pancreatic cancer risk (P < 0.05). Adjusting for multiple
comparisons, MGMT I143V AG/GG, PMS2 IVS1-1121C > T TC/TT, and PMS2L3 Ex1<U+2009>+<U+2009>118C >
T CT/TT genotypes showed significant main effects on pancreatic cancer risk at
FDR <1% with OR (95% CI) of 0.60 (0.46-0.80), 1.44 (1.14-1.81), and 5.54
(2.10-14.61), respectively (P = 0.0015). To demonstrate genotype-phenotype
association, we measured O(6)-ethylguanosine (O(6)-EtGua) adduct levels in vitro 
by immunoslot blot assay in lymphocytes treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) 
in 297 case/control subjects. MGMT I143V GG, MGMT K178R GG, MSH6 G39E AG/AA,
PMS2L3 IVS3<U+2009>+<U+2009>9A > G GA and TP73 IVS1-7449G > C CG/CC genotypes correlated with a
higher level of ENU-induced DNA adducts. Haplotypes of MGMT, MSH6, PMS2, PMS2L3, 
and TP73 were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk (P = 0.0015). 
Our findings suggest that mismatch repair gene variants may affect susceptibility
to pancreatic cancer.

Relationship between TP73 polymorphism (G4C14-A4T14) and cancer risk: a
meta-analysis based on literatures.

The tumor protein p73 (TP73) gene belongs to the TP53 gene family and functions
in the induction of apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest. The TP73 polymorphism
(G4C14-A4T14) has been reported and many studies have focused on the role of this
polymorphism in various cancers. However, the data reported for most individual
cancer types were limited and not able to support a convincible conclusion.
Hence, in this study, we explored the relationship between TP73 polymorphism
(G4C14-A4T14) and cancer risk by carrying out a comprehensive meta-analysis.
Performing both the overall and subgroup meta-analyses with a total of 23
eligible studies (6635 cases and 7378 controls in all), we detected significant
cancer risk variations in the overall analysis, as well as the subgroup analysis 
based on ethnicity for both Asians and Caucasians. In the subgroup analysis based
on source of controls, significant associations were also observed in the
hospital-based controls' subgroup yet not in the population-based controls'
subgroup. Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis based on cancer types,
significant associations were found in colorectal cancer's subgroup but not in
other cancer types' subgroups. In summary, according to the results of our
meta-analysis, the TP73 polymorphism (G4C14-A4T14) probably associates with
cancer risk.

[Methylation profiling of the cell cycle regulating genes in placenta of human
embryos with chromosomal mosaicism].

[Article in Russian]

Kashevarova AA, Tolmacheva EN, Sazhenova EA, Sikhanova NN, Lebedev IN.

To date the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms of cell cycle regulation,
ensuring genomic stability maintaining and accurate transfer of hereditary
information to daughter cells, is of a considerable interest. Development of the 
up-to-date molecular technologies allows determining methylation pattern of the
whole genome at a single round of analysis. In this work for the first time the
epigenetic status of placental tissues of human embryos with mosaic karyotype was
studied using the genome-wide Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Array
(Illumina, USA). The groups of genes, related to the cell cycle and its
regulation and containing differentially methylated CpG-sites in their promoter
regions, are determined. The methylation level of oncogenes (ARHGEF1, RGF5),
tumor-suppressors (APC2, BRACA2, DCC, GRLF1, RB1, TP73, TSPYL2, VHL) as well as
genes, participating in chromosome segregation regulation (CNTROB, GMNN, PROCR,

University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.

AIM: To investigate the epigenetic states and expression of imprinted genes in
five human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines derived in Taiwan.
METHODS: The heterozygous alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at
imprinted genes were analyzed by sequencing genomic DNAs of hESC lines and the
monoallelic expression of the imprinted genes were confirmed by sequencing the
cDNAs. The expression profiles of 32 known imprinted genes of five hESC lines
were determined using Affymetrix human genome U133 plus 2.0 DNA microarray.
RESULTS: The heterozygous alleles of SNPs at seven imprinted genes, IPW, PEG10,
NESP55, KCNQ1, ATP10A, TCEB3C and IGF2, were identified and the monoallelic
expression of these imprinted genes except IGF2 were confirmed. The IGF2 gene was
found to be imprinted in hESC line T2 but partially imprinted in line T3 and not 
imprinted in line T4 embryoid bodies. Ten imprinted genes, namely GRB10, PEG10,
SGCE, MEST, SDHD, SNRPN, SNURF, NDN, IPW and NESP55, were found to be highly
expressed in the undifferentiated hESC lines and down-regulated in differentiated
derivatives. The UBE3A gene abundantly expressed in undifferentiated hESC lines
and further up-regulated in differentiated tissues. The expression levels of
other 21 imprinted genes were relatively low in undifferentiated hESC lines and
five of these genes (TP73, COPG2, OSBPL5, IGF2 and ATP10A) were found to be
up-regulated in differentiated tissues.
CONCLUSION: The epigenetic states and expression of imprinted genes in hESC lines
should be thoroughly studied after extended culture and upon differentiation in
order to understand epigenetic stability in hESC lines before their clinical
applications.

bacillus Calmette-Guérin response in patients with T1G3 high-risk bladder
tumours.

    Nat Rev Urol. 2011 Jul;8(7):355.

BACKGROUND: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a standard treatment for reducing
tumour recurrence and delaying progression of high-risk non-muscle-invasive
bladder tumours. However, it is not clear yet which patients are more likely to
respond to BCG.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of the methylation of 25 tumour suppressor genes 
(TSG) as clinical outcome predictive biomarkers in T1G3 bladder tumours treated
with BCG.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective design included 91
paraffin-embedded tumours of patients with T1G3 primary non-muscle-invasive
disease undergoing nonmaintenance BCG treatment.
MEASUREMENTS: The methylation status of 25 TSGs was measured using a
methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA)
assay. Recurrence, progression into muscle-invasive tumours, and disease-specific
survival (DSS) rates were analysed using univariate and multivariate tests.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The genes most frequently methylated included STK11
(94.5%), MSH6 (81.3%), BRCA1 (72.5%), PAX5A (68.1%), MGMT (67.0%), CDH13 (62.6%),
and IGSF4 (61.5%). Methylation was newly identified in T1G3 tumours for TP73,
MSH6, ESR1, PAX5A, WT1, CD44, ATM, IGSF4, CHFR, BRCA2, THBS1, PYCARD, STK11, and 
GATA5. Methylation for several TSGs was significantly associated with
multifocality and tumour size. Patients with different methylation statuses of
TSGs showed differential recurrence rates (PAX6: p = 0.025), progression rates
(MSH6: p = 0.040; RB1: p = 0.042; THBS1: p = 0.041; PYCARD: p = 0.048; TP73: p = 
0.048; ESR1: p = 0.036; and GATA5: p = 0.019), and DSS rates (GATA5: p = 0.037). 
Several combinations improved prediction for progression. Multivariate analyses
indicated that among the combinations remaining as independent predictors, two
genes-MSH6 and THBS1-already provided the most significant predictive assessment 
for progression (p = 0.004). The major limitation of this study is related to its
retrospective design.
CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of TSGs was associated with the clinical
outcome of patients with T1G3 tumours undergoing BCG treatment under three
clinical end points: recurrence, progression, and DSS. The methylation status of 
TSGs distinguished patients responding to BCG from those who may require a more
aggressive therapeutic intervention.

[The coordinated interaction of multifunctional members of p53 family determines 
many key processes in multicellular organisms].

[Article in Russian]

Vilgelm AE, Zaika AI, Prasolov VS.

First time p53 was found in the complex with viral large T-antigene in the cells 
transformed by small DNA virus SV40. The cloning of p53 cDNA was done in the
beginning of eighties and soon after that the whole p53 gene was cloned. The p53 
family is comprised of three genes: TP53,TP63 and TP73, each of which is
expressed as a set of structurally and functionally different isoforms. All of
them intensively interact with each other forming a united functional network of 
proteins. In this review we discuss evolution of the p53 family and significance 
of all its members in embryonic development, reproduction, regeneration,
regulation of aging and life span, as well as in the body's defense against
cancer. With special attention we review the role of less studied members of the 
p53 family: p63 and p73, in oncogenesis and tumor progression and show that
different isoforms of these proteins might exert a contrary effect on these
processes.

About half of all human tumors contain an inactivating mutation of p53, while in 
the remaining tumors, the p53 pathway is frequently abrogated by alterations of
other components of its signaling pathway. In humans, the p53 tumor suppressor is
part of a small gene family that includes two other members, p73 and p63,
structurally and functionally related to p53. Accumulating evidences indicate
that all p53-family proteins function as molecular hubs of a highly
interconnected signaling network that coordinates cell proliferation,
differentiation and death in response to physiological inputs and oncogenic
stress. Therefore, not only the p53-pathway but the entire "p53-family pathway"
is a primary target for cancer drug development. In particular, the p53-related
protein p73 has a crucial role in determining cellular responses to chemotherapy,
and can vicariate p53 functions in triggering cell death after DNA damage in
multiple experimental models. The biology and regulation of p73 is complex, since
the TP73 gene incorporates both tumor-suppressive and proto-oncogenic functions. 
However, the p73 gene is rarely mutated in tumors, so appropriate pharmacological
manipulation of the p73 pathway is a very promising approach for cancer therapy. 
Here we provide an overview of the principal mechanism of p73 regulation, and
describe several examples of pharmacological tools that can induce p73
accumulation and function by acting on upstream p73 modulators or displacing
inhibitory p73 interactors. A better understanding of how the p73 pathway works
is mandatory to discover additional players intervening in this pathway and has
important implications for the improvement of cancer treatment with the
development of new molecules or with the reposition of currently available drugs.

Radiotherapy is increasingly used in adjuvant approaches for colorectal cancer
(CRC) to reduce local recurrence and improve survival. However, the principal
limitation is the large variability in response among different individuals due
to tumor heterogeneity. In the present study, we compared gene expression
profiles between radiosensitive and radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines
to identify radiation-related molecules that can be used to evaluate the effects 
of radiation. The CRC cell line SW620 was irradiated with a high-energy photo
beam. Following radiation treatment, RNA was extracted from non-irradiated and
irradiated cells, respectively, and gene expression analysis was performed by
oligonucleotide microarray and the DAVID bioinformatics method. To further
confirm the results, an additional 4 CRC cell lines, COLO205, T84, HCT116, SW480 
and SW403 were purchased from ATCC. The radiosensitivities of each were
determined by the survival fraction at 2 Gray (SF2) of the surviving cells using 
the ATPLite assay, and the gene expression profiles after irradiation among the
radiosensitive and radioresistant cell lines were analyzed by membrane arrays.
The relationships between gene expression and patient clinicopathological
features were also analyzed using membrane arrays and RT-PCR. The results from
oligonucleotide microarray analysis show that 1601 genes were up-regulated (gene 
expression ratio of post- to pre-radiation treatment>2). By bioinformatic
database analysis, 30 up-regulated genes were identified as involved in DNA
damage response pathways, immune response pathways and the complement and
coagulation cascades pathway. Fifteen genes showed differential gene expression
profiles between radiosensitive (HCT116 and SW620) and radioresistant CRC cell
lines (SW403 and SW480). In 110 CRC tissues, we detected five genes CDC25A, VAV1,
TP73, BRCA1 and ZAP70 from 15 overexpressed genes that significantly related to
prognostic factors (tumor size, advanced stage, invasive depth, lymph node
metastasis and differentiation). These findings suggest that CDC25A, VAV1, TP73, 
BRCA1 and ZAP70 may be novel markers for predicting the effectiveness of
radiotherapy in CRC patients.

p63 and p73 isoform expression in non-small cell lung cancer and corresponding
morphological normal lung tissue.

BACKGROUND: The TP73 and TP63 genes are members of the p53 tumor suppressor
family and are expressed in different N-terminal isoforms either with
proapoptotic (transactivation domain, TA) and antiapoptotic (N-terminally
truncated, <U+0394>N) function. Unlike p53, the role of p73 and p63 in tumor is
controversial. It has been recently hypothesized that altered <U+0394>N:TA expression
ratio, rather than single isoform overexpression, plays a role in the
pathogenesis of many diseases, including lung cancer.
METHODS: Isoform-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction and
immunohistochemistry analysis on matched cancer and corresponding normal tissues 
from surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have been performed
aiming to explore the expression levels of each p63 and p73 N-terminal isoforms
and their <U+0394>N:TA expression ratio.
RESULTS: For both p63 and p73, a N-terminal isoform-specific modulation that
alter <U+0394>N:TA isoform balance was identified. In particular, <U+0394>Np63 isoform was
significantly up-modulated, whereas TAp63 was slightly down-modulated in NSCLC
specimens. Likewise, <U+0394>2p73 and <U+0394>2/3p73 were up-modulated, whereas <U+0394>Np73 and
<U+0394>N'p73 isoforms were down-modulated. Moreover, a higher TAp63 and <U+0394>N'p73
transcripts expression, detected in the normal tissue surrounding the tumors,
correlates with poor patient outcome, representing independent prognostic factors
for overall survival (<U+0394>N'p73: p = 0.049, hazard ratio = 3.091, 95% confidence
interval = 1.005-9.524 and TAp63: p = 0.001, hazard ratio = 8.091, 95% confidence
interval = 2.254-29.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that p63 and p73 altered <U+0394>N:TA expression ratio 
occurs in NSCLC likely contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of this tumor.

Phospho-<U+0394>Np63a is a key regulator of the cisplatin-induced microRNAome in cancer 
cells.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells exposed to cisplatin (CIS)
displayed a dramatic ATM-dependent phosphorylation of <U+0394>Np63a that leads to the
transcriptional regulation of downstream mRNAs. Here, we report that phospho
(p)-<U+0394>Np63a transcriptionally deregulates miRNA expression after CIS treatment.
Several p-<U+0394>Np63a-dependent microRNA species (miRNAs) were deregulated in HNSCC
cells upon CIS exposure, including miR-181a, miR-519a, and miR-374a
(downregulated) and miR-630 (upregulated). Deregulation of miRNA expression led
to subsequent modulation of mRNA expression of several targets (TP53-S46, HIPK2, 
ATM, CDKN1A and 1B, CASP3, PARP1 and 2, DDIT1 and 4, BCL2 and BCL2L2, TP73, YES1,
and YAP1) that are involved in the apoptotic process. Our data support the notion
that miRNAs are critical downstream targets of p-<U+0394>Np63a and mediate key pathways 
implicated in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, Unit 426, The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1550 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas
77030-4009, USA.

PURPOSE: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genomic stability and mediates
cellular response to DNA damage. We aim to demonstrate whether MMR genetic
variants affect overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Sequenom method in genomic DNA, we
retrospectively genotyped 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 13 MMR
genes from 706 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma seen at The University of 
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Association between genotype and OS was
evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models.
RESULTS: At a false discovery rate of 1% (p = .0015), 15 SNPs of EXO1, MLH1,
MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2, PMS2L3, TP73, and TREX1 in patients with localized
disease (n = 333) and 6 SNPs of MSH3, MSH6, and TP73 in patients with locally
advanced or metastatic disease (n = 373) were significantly associated with OS.
In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models, SNPs of EXO1, MSH2,
MSH3, PMS2L3, and TP73 in patients with localized disease, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and 
TP73 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and EXO1, MGMT,
MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2L3, and TP73 in all patients remained significant
predictors for OS (p = .0015) after adjusting for all clinical predictors and all
SNPs with p = .0015 in single-locus analysis. Sixteen haplotypes of EXO1, MLH1,
MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2, PMS2L3, RECQL, TP73, and TREX1 significantly correlated
with OS in all patients (p = .001).
CONCLUSION: MMR gene variants may have potential value as prognostic markers for 
OS in pancreatic cancer patients.

<U+0394>Np73 is an anti-apoptotic product of the TP73 gene whose function in the immune 
system has not been extensively studied. We analyzed human tonsil B cell
subpopulations physically subdivided into resting or activated fractions and
found <U+0394>Np73 gene expression essentially in cells bearing features of activation. 
Moreover, and accordingly, both these fractions proved to be sensitive to
treatment in culture with the polyclonal activator TPA that caused substantial
increase in <U+0394>Np73 mRNA and protein expression. We also analyzed the TP73
oncogenic-relevant internal promoter 2 (P2) and identified epigenetics as its
major regulatory factor since active DNA and histone configurations strictly
correlated with <U+0394>Np73 expression upon activation by agents capable of loosening
chromatin compaction. Finally, in line with the known TPA pathway, we found that 
nuclear proteins could bind a sequence corresponding to a unique AP1 site on
promoter 2 selectively in the activated cell fraction. Our results suggest a
<U+0394>Np73 function in B cell immunity, indicate epigenetics as master TP73 P2
regulator, and point to AP1 site occupancy as playing an putative mechanistic
role in this process.

Unraveling the genetics of otitis media: from mouse to human and back again.

Otitis media (OM) is among the most common illnesses of early childhood,
characterised by the presence of inflammation in the middle ear cavity. Acute OM 
and chronic OM with effusion (COME) affect the majority of children by school age
and have heritability estimates of 40-70%. However, the majority of genes
underlying this susceptibility are, as yet, unidentified. One method of
identifying genes and pathways that may contribute to OM susceptibility is to
look at mouse mutants displaying a comparable phenotype. Single-gene mouse
mutants with OM have identified a number of genes, namely, Eya4, Tlr4, p73,
MyD88, Fas, E2f4, Plg, Fbxo11, and Evi1, as potential and biologically relevant
candidates for human disease. Recent studies suggest that this "mouse-to-human"
approach is likely to yield relevant data, with significant associations reported
between polymorphisms at the FBXO11, TLR4, and PAI1 genes and disease in humans. 
An association between TP73 and chronic rhinosinusitis has also been reported. In
addition, the biobanks of available mouse mutants provide a powerful resource for
functional studies of loci identified by future genome-wide association studies
of OM in humans. Mouse models of OM therefore are an important component of
current approaches attempting to understand the complex genetic susceptibility to
OM in humans, and which aim to facilitate the development of preventative and
therapeutic interventions for this important and common disease.

Using EpiLymph case-control data, we found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia
patients were more likely to have abnormal reactive serological patterns to
Epstein Barr virus than controls. Here, we aimed to assess whether this
association is modified by genetic variants. We examined 1,305 Single Nucleotide 
Polymorphisms from 300 selected genes related to various pathways in 240 cases
and 513 controls from five European centers. In a recessive model, patients
positive to aberrant antibody pattern and homozygous for rare genotypes in
rs8113877T>G or rs17576A>G of the MMP9 gene were at highest risk of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. In a dominant model, TP73 showed the highest risk in
patients positive to aberrant antibody pattern and homozygous for the wild-type
genotype in rs1885859G>C or rs3765701A>T. All interactions were additive and no
main effect was observed. The strong interactions observed may be indicative of a
specific pathway in cancer genesis. Confirmation of these results is warranted.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether clinical outcome after
surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different
proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA
(rs2273535), ERBB2 (rs1136201), MDM2 (rs2279744), CDH1 (rs5030625), CDKN2A
(rs11515), and TP73 (rs2273953) genes were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of
346 esophageal cancer patients, who had underwent surgical resection with
curative intent. Associations with disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed with
Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the
tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients with EAC or ESCC. However, in a
multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2
(rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients
carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 0.63; 95%
confidence interval (CI) [0.45-0.88]). Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous
CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared 
with patients carrying the wild-type genotype AHR 4.0, 95% CI [1.4-11].
CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients, the MDM2 T/G and
CDH1 GA/GA genotype confer risk of death in patients with EAC. These data suggest
that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in
patients with EAC.

We evaluate whether 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) downregulates TP73 variants in colon and
breast carcinomas, the role of survivin in this context, and the significance of 
this network in the clinic. Tumor cells were treated/untreated with
1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and transiently transfected with survivin. Levels of survivin and
TP73 variants were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. In 75
colon and 60 breast cancer patients, the expressions of survivin and TP73
isoforms were determined. Tumor characteristics were examined in each patient.
Survivin protein levels were also evaluated in a subgroup of patients and cell
lines. Decrease in survivin and TAp73 transcripts and protein and <U+0394>Np73 mRNA was 
detected after 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. Ectopic survivin expression led to an
increase in the TAp73, <U+0394>Np73, <U+0394>Ex2p73, and <U+0394>Ex2-3p73 transcripts. In cancer
patients, direct correlations were observed between TP73 variants and survivin
levels. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) negatively regulate survivin and TP73 variants in colon
and breast cancer cells. Positive regulation of TP73 isoforms by survivin may
exist, which reinforces the possibility that the downregulation of TP73 forms by 
1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is survivin-dependent.

New and effective treatment strategies are desperately needed for malignant
mesothelioma (MM), an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. We have shown
previously that acid-prepared mesoporous microspheres (APMS) are nontoxic after
intrapleural or intraperitoneal (IP) administration to rodents. The purpose here 
was to evaluate the utility of APMS in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to human
MM cells in vitro and in two mouse xenograft models of MM. Uptake and release of 
doxorubicin (DOX) alone or loaded in APMS (APMS-DOX) were evaluated in MM cells. 
MM cell death and gene expression linked to DNA damage/repair were also measured 
in vitro. In two severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft models, mice
received saline, APMS, DOX or APMS-DOX injected directly into subcutaneous (SC)
MM tumors or injected IP after development of human MMs peritoneally. Other mice 
received DOX intravenously (IV) via tail vein injections. In comparison to DOX
alone, APMS-DOX enhanced intracellular uptake of DOX, MM death and expression of 
GADD34 and TP73. In the SC MM model, 3× weekly SC injections of APMS-DOX or DOX
alone significantly inhibited tumor volumes, and systemic DOX administration was 
lethal. In mice developing IP MMs, significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of
mesenteric tumor numbers, weight and volume was achieved using IP administration 
of APMS-DOX at one-third the DOX concentration required after IP injections of
DOX alone. These results suggest APMS are efficacious for the localized delivery 
of lower effective DOX concentrations in MM and represent a novel means of
treating intracavitary tumors.

PURPOSE: To advance the characterization of tumor-associated cell-free DNA in
blood and bone marrow (BM), a rapid profiling method using methylation-specific
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) was established.
MS-MLPA detects genetic and epigenetic aberrations of 37 tumor suppressor genes
(TSG) in a single reaction and might, therefore, avoid the cumbersome single gene
analyses.
METHODS: The validity of MS-MLPA for using cell-free plasma DNA was assessed by
analyzing blood and BM samples of 91 patients with prostate cancer. As reference 
analyses, the methylation patterns of 4 genes (CD44, E-cadherin, CDKN2A and PTEN)
chosen from the TSG set of the MS-MLPA kit were investigated in single reactions 
by sodium bisulfite DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Copy number changes and aberrant DNA methylation of 37 circulating TSG
could be analyzed in BM and blood of 30 and 13 of the 91 patients, respectively, 
whereas the DNA content in the remaining samples was too low (<50 ng/µl of eluted
DNA). The copy number of 28 of the 37 TSG was altered, and most changes were
found for APC, CHFR, TP73 and GSTP1 genes in BM plasma. Statistical evaluations
showed an association between copy number changes of TP73 and a positive
resection margin of the prostate (p = 0.05). Both MS-MLPA and sodium bisulfite
sequencing techniques showed that all genes were unmethylated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the potential and limitation of MS-MLPA for 
multiplex characterization of TSG in cell-free plasma DNA as a new non-invasive
approach to obtain information on the molecular tumor biology of individual
cancer patients.

Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, 3002, Australia.

Phyllodes tumours and cellular fibroadenomas are both fibroepithelial tumours of 
the breast. Phyllodes tumours, unlike fibroadenomas, have the ability to recur
and metastasise. Although these lesions can be distinguished by their stromal
cellularity, mitotic index, presence or absence of stromal overgrowth and
cellular atypia, there is overlap and not infrequently a definitive diagnosis
cannot be made, particularly on biopsy. We sought to evaluate whether DNA
promoter methylation profiling using selected genes known to be methylated in
cancer would allow us to learn more about the biology of these tumours, and
whether it could identify methylation markers that could differentiate phyllodes 
tumours from fibroadenomas and/or distinguish phyllodes tumours of different
grades. Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) was used to screen
promoter DNA methylation changes in 86 phyllodes tumours (15 benign, 28
borderline, 43 malignant) and 26 fibroadenomas. A panel of 11 genes (RASSF1A,
TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, RARß, CDKN2A, CDH1, TP73 and MLH1) was tested.
Methylation status was correlated with histology and with clinicopathological
parameters. Five of the gene promoters showed some methylation in a proportion of
phyllodes tumours; RASSF1A, 45.3%; TWIST1, 10.7%; APC, 4.1%; WIF1, 2.9% and MGMT,
1.3%. Only two genes showed any methylation in fibroadenomas usually at
background levels; RASSF1A, 53.8% and MGMT, 8.3%. No CDKN2A methylation was
observed in either tumour type, contrary to previous reports. Overall, the
methylation patterns differed little from that which might be seen in normal
cells. However, significant levels of methylation of RASSF1A (24.4%) and TWIST1
(7.1%) was observed in some phyllodes tumours. Elevated RASSF1A and/or TWIST1
methylation was significantly associated with phyllodes tumours compared with
fibroadenomas (P = 0.02), TWIST1 methylation correlated with increasing
malignancy in phyllodes tumours (P < 0.001). In conclusion, assessment of
methylation of RASSF1A and TWIST1 may aid in the diagnosis of phyllodes tumours. 
The absence of frequent methylation in fibroadenomas supports a non-neoplastic
origin.

Promoter methylation is a gene- and cancer type-specific epigenetic event that
plays an important role in tumour development. As endometrioid (endometrioid
endometrial carcinoma, EEC) and serous endometrial cancers (uterine papillary
serous carcinoma, UPSC) exhibit different clinical, histological and molecular
genetic characteristics, we hypothesized that these differences may be reflected 
in epigenetic phenomena as well. Identification of a panel of methylation
biomarkers could be helpful in a correct histological classification of these two
subtypes, which solely on the basis of morphology is not always easy.
Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to
assess the extent of promoter methylation of different tumour suppressor genes in
EEC and UPSC. Methylation results were correlated with histology and survival.
The median cumulative methylation index of all genes was significantly higher in 
EEC (124) than in UPSC (93) (P<0.001). Promoter methylation of CDH13 and MLH1 was
more frequently present in EEC, while CDKN2B and TP73 were more frequently
methylated in UPSC. Almost 90% of EEC and 70% of UPSC could be predicted by CDH13
and TP73. In EEC, methylation of MLH1 was associated with a shorter disease-free 
survival (DFS; P<0.0001) and overall survival (OS; P=0.005). In a multivariate
model, MLH1 methylation emerged as an additional prognostic factor to stage for
DFS (P=0.002). In conclusion, promoter methylation is more common in EEC than
UPSC. A panel of methylation biomarkers could be useful to distinguish between
the two histological subtypes of endometrial cancer. Furthermore, methylation of 
MLH1 may have prognostic value in EEC.

Regulating the genome surveillance system: miRNAs and the p53 super family.

Bailey SG(1), Sanchez-Elsner T, Stephanou A, Cragg MS, Townsend PA.

Author information:

The p53 gene super family consists of three members; TP53, TP63 and TP73,
encoding proteins p53, p63 and p73. Whilst p63 appears to have an essential role 
in embryonic development with a less clear role in carcinogenesis, irregularities
in p53 and p73 signalling are implicated in tumour formation. As such, p53 is a
tumour suppressor which is mutated in over 50% cancers and p73 was recently
formally classified as a tumour suppressor based on data showing p73 deficient
mice generate spontaneous tumours similar to those observed in p53 null mice.
Dysregulation of both p53 and p73 has been correlated with cancer progression in 
many cell types and although mutation of these genes is often observed, some form
of p53/p73 deregulation likely occurs in all tumour cells. The discovery that
complementary micro RNAs (miRNAs) are able to target both of these genes provides
a potential new means of perturbing p53/p73 signalling networks in cancer cells. 
Here we summarise the current literature regarding the involvement of miRNAs in
the modulation of p53 family proteins and cancer development and detail the use
of in silico methods to reveal key miRNA targets.

The question of how neural progenitor cells maintain its self-renewal throughout 
life is a fundamental problem in cell biology with implications in cancer, aging 
and neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we have analyzed the p73 function
in embryonic neural progenitor cell biology using the neurosphere (NS)-assay and 
showed that p73-loss has a significant role in the maintenance of
neurosphere-forming cells in the embryonic brain. A comparative study of NS from 
Trp73-/-, p53KO, p53KO;Trp73-/- and their wild-type counterparts demonstrated
that p73 deficiency results in two independent, but related, phenotypes: a
smaller NS size (related to the proliferation and survival of the
neural-progenitors) and a decreased capacity to form NS (self-renewal). The
former seems to be the result of p53 compensatory activity, whereas the latter is
p53 independent. We also demonstrate that p73 deficiency increases the population
of neuronal progenitors ready to differentiate into neurons at the expense of
depleting the pool of undifferentiated neurosphere-forming cells. Analysis of the
neurogenic niches demonstrated that p73-loss depletes the number of
neural-progenitor cells, rendering deficient niches in the adult mice.
Altogether, our study identifies TP73 as a positive regulator of self-renewal
with a role in the maintenance of the neurogenic capacity. Thus, proposing p73 as
an important player in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and a
potential therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION: The protein p73 is the first identified homolog of the tumor
suppressor gene p53, but its function in tumor development has not been
established. Indeed, the results regarding the p73 implication in colorectal
cancers is still controversial.
AIM: We investigated whether the p73 is implicated in colorectal cancer, whether 
the p73 expression is related to prognosis and whether the p73 expression is
correlated with p21-ras or p53.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comparative immunohistochemical analysis of
p73, p53, and p21ras proteins in primary colorectal tumor with matched normal
mucosa and metastasis from 204 patients with colorectal cancer. We correlated
these expressions with clinicopathologic variables and we compared the different 
profiles between nonmucinous carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma.
RESULTS: In this study, we did not find any correlation between p73 expression,
sex, age, site, differentiation and stage. Overexpression of p73 was
significantly correlated with infiltrating growth pattern (P<0.0001) and
nonmucinous carcinoma (P<0.0001). Furthermore, frequency and intensity of p73
expression were marquedly increased from normal mucosa (26%), to primary tumors
(75%) and to metastasis (97%). Furthermore, expression of p73 was also correlated
with shorter survival period. The prognostic significance of p73 expression
remained, even after adjustment for the clinical and pathologic variables. The
p73 expression was positively correlated only with p21ras expression (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: All these findings prove that p73 expression should be considered as
a valuable poor prognostic marker. Our data also suggest that TP73 gene may play 
a role in colorectal carcinoma development.

Disruption or loss of tumor suppressor gene TP53 is implicated in the development
or progression of almost all different types of human malignancies. Other members
of the p53 family have been identified. One member, p73, not only shares a high
degree of similarity with p53 in its primary sequence, but also has similar
functions. Like p53, p73 can bind to DNA and activate transcription. Using
PCR-SSCP and gene sequencing, we analyzed the TP53 and TP73 genes in a case of a 
grade III anaplastic astrocytoma that progressed to glioblastoma. We found a
deletion of AAG at position 595-597 of TP53 (exon 6), resulting in the deletion
of Glu 199 in the protein and a genomic polymorphism of TP73, identified as an
A-to-G change, at position E8/+15 at intron 8 (IVS8-15A>G). The mutation found at
exon 6 of the gene TP53 could be associated with the rapid tumoral progression
found in this case, since the mutated p53 may inactivate the wild-type p53 and
the p73alpha protein, which was conserved here, leading to an increase in
cellular instability.

undetermined significance.

Aberrant DNA methylation is considered an important epigenetic mechanism for gene
inactivation. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is
believed to be a precursor of multiple myeloma (MM). We have analyzed methylation
status of p15 INK4B , p16 INK4A , ARF, SOCS-1, p27 KIP1 , RASSF1A, and TP73 genes
in bone marrow DNA samples from 21 MGUS and 44 MM patients, in order to determine
the role of aberrant promoter methylation as one of the steps involved in the
progression of MGUS to MM. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay
followed by DNA sequencing of the resulting product was performed. SOCS-1 gene
methylation was significantly more frequent in MM (52%) than in MGUS (14%;
p=0,006). Methylation frequencies of TP73, ARF, p15 INK4B , p16 INK4A , and
RASSF1A were comparable in MGUS: 33%, 29%, 29%, 5%, and 0%, to that observed in
MM: 45%, 29%, 32%, 7%, and 2%. All patients lacked methylation at p27 KIP1 gene. 
In both entities, a concurrent methylation of p15 INK4B and TP73 was observed.
The mean methylation index of MGUS was lower (0.16) than that of MM (0.24;
p<0.05). Correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics showed a higher mean
age in MGUS patients with SOCS-1 methylated (p<0.001); meanwhile in MM,
methylation of p15 INK4B was more frequent in males (p=0.009) and IgG isotype
(p=0.038). Our findings suggest methylation of TP73, ARF, p15 INK4B , and p16
INK4A as early events in the pathogenesis and development of plasma cell
disorders; meanwhile, SOCS-1 methylation would be an important step in the clonal
evolution from MGUS to MM.

PURPOSE: Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant syndrome of familial
malignancies resulting from germ line mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR)
genes. Our goal was to take a pathway-based approach to investigate the influence
of polymorphisms in cell cycle-related genes on age of onset for Lynch syndrome
using a tree model.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated polymorphisms in a panel of cell cycle-related 
genes (AURKA, CDKN2A, TP53, E2F2, CCND1, TP73, MDM2, IGF1, and CDKN2B) in 220 MMR
gene mutation carriers from 129 families. We applied a novel statistical
approach, tree modeling (Classification and Regression Tree), to the analysis of 
data on patients with Lynch syndrome to identify individuals with a higher
probability of developing colorectal cancer at an early age and explore the
gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in cell cycle genes.
RESULTS: We found that the subgroup with CDKN2A C580T wild-type genotype, IGF1
CA-repeats >or=19, E2F2 variant genotype, AURKA wild-type genotype, and CCND1
variant genotype had the youngest age of onset, with a 45-year median onset age, 
while the subgroup with CDKN2A C580T wild-type genotype, IGF1 CA-repeats >or=19, 
E2F2 wild-type genotype, and AURKA variant genotype had the latest median age of 
onset, which was 70 years. Furthermore, we found evidence of a possible gene-gene
interaction between E2F2 and AURKA genes related to CRC age of onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in these cell cycle-related genes work together to
modify the age at the onset of CRC in patients with Lynch syndrome. These studies
provide an important part of the foundation for development of a model for
stratifying age of onset risk among those with Lynch syndrome.

and inhibit tumor growth in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Differential mRNA splicing and alternative promoter usage of the TP73
gene results in the expression of multiple NH2-truncated isoforms that act as
oncogenes. Abundant levels of these p73 variants in a variety of human cancers
correlated with adverse clinical prognosis and response failure to conventional
therapies, underscoring their relevance as marker for disease severity and target
for cancer intervention. With respect to an equally important role for
amino-truncated p73 splice forms (DeltaTAp73) and DeltaNp73 (summarized as DNp73)
in the tumorigenic process, we designed locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmers against individual species that were complementary 
to DeltaEx2 and DeltaEx2/3 splice junctions and a region in exon 3B unique for
DeltaN' and DeltaN.
RESULTS: Treatment of cancer cells with these ASOs resulted in a strong and
specific reduction of tumorigenic p73 transcripts and proteins, importantly,
without abolishing the wild-type p73 tumor suppressor form as observed with
p73-shRNA. The specific antisense oligonucleotides rescued cells from apoptosis
inhibition due to overexpression of their corresponding amino-truncated p73
isoform and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, ASO-116 against
DeltaEx2/3 coupled to magnetic nanobead polyethyleneimine (MNB/PEI) carriers
significantly inhibited malignant melanoma growth, which correlated with a shift 
in the balance between endogenous TAp73 and DeltaEx2/3 towards apoptotic
full-length p73.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the successful development of LNA-ASOs that
selectively differentiate between the closely related p73 oncoproteins, and
provide new tools to further delineate their biological properties in different
human malignancies and for therapeutic cancer targeting.

Amphiregulin induces the alternative splicing of p73 into its oncogenic isoform
DeltaEx2p73 in human hepatocellular tumors.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inactivation of the product of the tumor suppressor gene TP73 
does not usually occur by mutation but rather through expression of truncated
isoforms that have dominant-negative effects on p73 and p53. The truncated
oncogenic isoform DeltaEx2p73 is expressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and
is produced through the alternative splicing of p73 pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA);
however, the underlying mechanisms regulating this process are unknown.
METHODS: We used human normal and diseased liver tissue samples, as well as human
HCC cell lines, to examine the association between activation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) by its ligand amphiregulin (AR) and the alternative
splicing of p73 pre-mRNA into the tumorigenic isoform DeltaEx2p73, via c-Jun
N-terminal-kinase-1-mediated signaling.
RESULTS: DeltaEx2p73 was expressed in a subset of premalignant cirrhotic livers
and in otherwise healthy livers that harbored a primary tumor, as well as in HCC 
tissues. DeltaEx2p73 expression was correlated with that of the EGFR ligand AR,
which was previously shown to have a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Autocrine
activation of the EGFR by AR triggered c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 activity and
inhibited the expression of the splicing regulator Slu7, leading to the
accumulation of DeltaEx2p73 transcripts in HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a mechanism for the generation of protumorigenic
DeltaEx2p73 during liver tumorigenesis, via activation of EGFR signaling by AR
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 activity, leading to inhibition of the splicing
regulator Slu7.

BACKGROUND: THP-1 is a human monocytic leukemia cell line derived from a patient 
with acute monocytic leukemia. The cell line differentiates into macrophage-like 
cells by stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Although it has been
used frequently as a model for macrophage differentiation in research including
the FANTOM4/Genome Network Project, there are few reports on its genomic
constitution. Therefore, we attempted to reveal the genomic aberrations in these 
cells with the microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
technique.
FINDINGS: We report large aberrations, including deletions 6p, 12p, 17p, and
trisomy 8, and revealed breakpoints in the MLL and MLLT3 genes. Moreover, we
found novel genomic aberrations such as a hemizygous narrow deletion partially
containing the TP73 gene and homozygous deletions, including the CDKN2A, CDKN2B
and PTEN genes.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 119 aberrant regions in autosomal
chromosomes, and at least 16 of these aberrations were less than 100 kb, most of 
which were undetectable in the previous works. We also revealed a total of 4.6 Mb
of homozygous deleted regions. Our results will provide a base to precisely
understand studies involving the THP-1 cell line, especially the huge amount of
data generated from the FANTOM4/Genome Network Project.

The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well
as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. Although TAp73alpha and -beta 
proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and
differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative
repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid 
differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration.
However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are
expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the
capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this
study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha.
Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid 
differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73
and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells,
K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid
genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed 
in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis.

Genomic imprinting refers to silencing of one parental allele in the zygotes of
gametes depending upon the parent of origin. Loss of imprinting (LOI) is the gain
of function from the silent allele that can have a maximum effect of doubling the
gene dosage. LOI may play a significant role in the etiology of intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR). Using placental tissue from ten normal and seven IUGR 
pregnancies, we conducted a systematic survey of the expression of a panel of 74 
"putatively" imprinted genes using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that 52/74 (
approximately 70%) of the genes were expressed in human placentas. Nine of the 52
(17%) expressed genes were significantly differentially expressed between normal 
and IUGR placentas; five were upregulated (PHLDA2, ILK2, NNAT, CCDC86, PEG10) and
four downregulated (PLAGL1, DHCR24, ZNF331, CDKAL1). We also assessed LOI profile
of 14 imprinted genes in 14 normal and 24 IUGR placentas using a functional and
sensitive assay developed in our laboratory. Little LOI was observed in any
placentas for five of the genes (PEG10, PHLDA2, MEG3, EPS15, CD44). With the 149 
heterozygosities examined, 40 (26.8%) exhibited LOI >3%. Some genes exhibited
frequent LOI in placentas regardless of the disease status (IGF2, TP73, MEST,
SLC22A18, PEG3), while others exhibited LOI only in IUGR placentas (PLAGL1, DLK1,
H19, SNRPN). Importantly, there was no correlation between gene expression and
LOI profile. Our study suggests that genomic imprinting may play a role in IUGR
pathogenesis, but mechanisms other than LOI may contribute to dysregulation of
imprinted genes.

Few studies exist regarding the methylation status of the TP73 CpG island in
plasma cell dyscrasias. We have tested whether CpG methylation of both CDKN2A and
TP73 occurs in 45 individuals with multiple myeloma (24 male and 21 female, mean 
age 66.4 years) and in 4 patients (2 male and 2 female, mean age 61.7 years) with
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. No patient was found to be methylated for the
promoter of TP73 while CDKN2A promoter was found to be methylated in 12/45 MM
patients (26.6%) at diagnosis and in 1/4 WM patients. To verify the absence of
detectable methylation observed using MSP, we performed bisulphite sequence
analysis on a subset of the cases and confirmed the absence of methylation.
Interesting trends were identified where patients with methylated CDKN2A had an
increased risk of death (HR = 1.9, p = 0.32), advanced stage disease (DS > or =
II) (OR = 1.9, p = 0.3) and anemia (OR = 1.4, p = 0.6). TP73 CpG methylation is
an infrequent event in patients with MM and WM. Further evaluation in a larger
sample of patients is needed in order to enhance our statistical power and to
test our hypothesis that CDKN2A methylation status can become a useful prognostic
biomarker.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is one of the most aggressive cancers of the skin. It
has recently been reported that integration of a Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)
in receptor tyrosine phosphates type G (PTPRG) gene occurs in MCC, and that viral
infections are associated with epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes
(TSG) in cancer. To examine whether a correlation between TSG inactivation and
viral infection can be found in MCC, we investigated the promoter
hypermethylation of RASSF1A, TP73, PTPRG, FHIT, and CDKN2A and the presence of
MCPyV and SV40 in 98 MCC by PCR. Hypermethylation of RASSF1A was frequently found
in 42 of 83 (51%) of MCC. Methylation of CDKN2A was present in 9 of 41 (22%) of
MCC. Hypermethylation of TP73 (0%), PTPRG (4%), and FHIT (0%) was infrequent in
MCC. Interestingly, MCPyV was found in 90 of 98 (92%) MCC, however, no SV40
signal was detected. No correlation between TSG hypermethylation and viral
infection was found. Our results show frequent hypermethylation of RASSF1A and
the presence of MCPyV in primary MCC, and that these events may contribute to the
pathogenesis of MCC.

outcome of pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is critical in maintaining genomic stability
and may modulate the cellular response to gemcitabine. We hypothesized that
genetic variations in MMR may affect the clinical outcome of patients with
pancreatic cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
eight MMR genes in 154 patients with potentially resectable pancreatic
adenocarcinoma who were enrolled onto phase II clinical trials for preoperative
gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy from 1999 to 2006. Associations of genotypes 
with tumor response to therapy (change of tumor size by radiologic evaluation at 
restaging), margin-negative tumor resection, and overall survival were evaluated 
using logistic regression and Cox proportional regression models.
RESULTS: Five, six, and 10 genotypes were significantly associated with tumor
response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy, tumor resectability, and overall
survival, respectively, in univariable analysis. TREX1 EX14-460C>T and TP73
Ex2+4G>A genotypes remained as significant predictors for tumor response, MLH1
IVS12-169C>T and TP73 remained as significant predictors for tumor resectability,
and EXO1 R354H, TREX1, and TP73 remained as significant predictors for overall
survival in multivariable models that included all clinical factors and genotypes
examined. A strong combined genotype effect on each clinical end point was
observed. For example, 20 of the 25 patients with zero to one adverse genotypes
were alive, those with two, three, four, five, and six to seven adverse genotypes
had median survival times of 36.2, 23.9, 16.3, 13.0, and 8.3 months, respectively
(P < .001).
CONCLUSION: SNPs of MMR genes have a potential value as predictors for clinical
response to chemoradiotherapy and as prognostic markers for tumor resectability
and overall survival of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.

Gene silencing through promoter hypermethylation is a growing concept in the
development of human cancers. In this study, we examined the contribution of
aberrant methylation of promoter regions in methylation-prone tumor suppressors
to the pathogenesis of vulvar cancer. Thirteen cell lines from 12 patients with
squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were evaluated for aberrant methylation
status and gene copy number alterations, concomitantly, using the
methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. Of
the 22 tumor suppressor genes examined, aberrant methylation was observed for 9
genes: tumor protein p73 (TP73), fragile histidine triad (FHIT), von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL), adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), estrogen receptor 1
(ESR1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B), death-associated protein
kinase 1 (DAPK1), glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1), and immunoglobin
superfamily, member 4 (IGSF4). The most frequently methylated genes included TP73
in 9 of 13 cell lines, and IGSF4, DAPK1, and FHIT in 3 of 13 cell lines.
Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed for TP73 and FHIT to
confirm aberrant methylation by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification. In the context of gene copy number and methylation status,
both copies of the TP73 gene were hypermethylated. Loss or decreased mRNA
expression of TP73 and IGSF4 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
confirmed aberrant methylation. Frequent genetic alterations of loss and gain of 
gene copy number included gain of GSTP1 and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
(MEN1), and loss of malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFHAS1) 
and IGSF4 in over 50% of the squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva cell lines.
These findings underscore the contribution of both genetic and epigenetic events 
to the underlying pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.

High-risk types of HPV express the oncoproteins, E6 and E7, that can inactivate
TP53 and RB1, respectively, and thus take control of both cell cycle and
apoptosis. Herein, the mRNA expression profiles of 24 G1/S checkpoint genes were 
analysed in cancer and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) of the uterine
cervix. In total 35 squamous cervical carcinomas, 26 high-grade SIL (HSIL), 33
low-grade SIL (LSIL) tissues, and 28 normal uterine cervix specimens as controls 
were assessed by RT-PCR. Five genes were found to be upregulated only in tumours,
RBL2, E2F2, CDK6, CCNE1 and MYC; eight in tumours and HSILs, E2F1, E2F3, E2F5,
CCND1, CDK2, CDKN1B, PCNA and POLA, and five in tumours, HSILs and LSILs, TP53,
E2F4, CDKN1A, CDKN2A and DHFR. MDM2 was found to be upregulated in SIL, while
RBL1 was found to be downregulated in all three groups of cases. TP73 exhibited
lower levels in carcinomas; however, its exon 13-containing isoforms were
increased and exon 2-containing isoforms were reduced in both cancer and HSIL.
Three genes, RB1, CDK4 and CDKN2D, did not exhibit any significant alteration in 
gene expression. Hierarchical clustering revealed that this set of G1/S
checkpoint genes was able to discriminate the total 122 samples into groups of
disease and non-disease with only 8 exceptions (6.6%). Our data suggest that
deregulation of G1/S phase transition in cervical carcinogenesis is a progressive
process. Certain clusters of genes are activated very early in pre-cancerous SILs
while others are activated later, during malignant transformation. The ability of
this array of markers to identify disease status suggests that it could be used
for diagnostic purposes.

BACKGROUND: Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the drug of choice for the
palliative treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), resistance to the drug is a
therapeutic obstacle. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms
underlying 5-FU resistance of CCA using cell lines derived from CCA associated
with liver fluke infection.
METHODS: A stepwise exposure was used for inducing 5-FU-resistant CCA cell lines,
and the expression of nine genes associated with 5-FU resistance was analyzed
using real-time (RT)-PCR.
RESULTS: Altered expression of several genes involved in 5-FU resistance in CCA
cell lines was observed. The expression levels of almost all target genes
investigated including TP, DPD, ENT1, UNG1, TOP2A, BIRC5, TP73 and DeltaNp73
appeared to be significantly altered in these resistant strains. The expression
of the TS gene tended to be increased but the fold change was not significantly
different from their parental cell lines. UNG1 (a DNA repairing enzyme) and BIRC5
(an apoptotic inhibitor) expressions were increased whereas TP73 (a proapoptotic 
factor) expression levels decreased concomitantly.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that increases in UNG1 and BIRC5 expression and
concomitant decreases in TP73 expression may be associated with development of
acquired 5-FU resistance in CCA lines and their phenotypes.

MYCN activation, mainly by gene amplification, is one of the most frequent
molecular events in neuroblastoma (NB) oncogenesis, and is associated with
increased malignancy and decreased neuronal differentiation propensity. The
frequency of concomitant loss of heterozygosity at the 1p36.3 locus, which
harbours the p53 anti-oncogene homologue TP73, indicates that MYCN and p73
alterations may cooperate in the pathogenesis of NB. We have previously shown
that p73 isoforms are deregulated in NB tumours and that TAp73 co-operates
synergistically with p53 for apoptosis of NB cells, whereas DeltaNp73 activates
the expression of neuronal differentiation genes such as BTG2. Herein, using both
ectopic expression and RNA interference-mediated silencing of p73 in MYCN
amplified NB cells, we show that p73alpha isoforms inhibit MYCN expression at
both transcript and protein levels, in spite of transactivator effects on MYCN
promoter. To explain this paradox, we found that TAp73alpha exerts negative
post-transcriptional effects leading to reduced MYCN mRNA stability. RNA
immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that this dominant inhibitory
post-transcriptional effect could be due to an interaction between the p73
protein and MYCN mRNA, a hypothesis also raised for the regulation of certain
genes by the p53 protein.

PURPOSE: This study aims to quantitatively assess promoter and global methylation
changes in pheochromocytomas and abdominal paragangliomas and its relation to
tumor phenotypes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A panel of 53 primary tumors (42 benign, 11 malignant) was
analyzed by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. Based on methylation levels in
the tumor suppressor genes, p16(INK4A), CDH1, DCR2, RARB, RASSF1A, NORE1A, TP73, 
APC, DAPK1, p14(ARF), and PTEN, a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was
defined as concerted hypermethylation in three or more genes. Mean Z scores for
the hypermethylated promoters were calculated to characterize overall promoter
methylation. Global DNA methylation was quantified for LINE-1 promoter sequences 
and by using luminescent methylation analysis.
RESULTS: Five primary tumors (9.4%) exhibited a CIMP phenotype, four of which
were malignant paragangliomas. CIMP was significantly associated with malignant
behavior (P = 0.005) and younger age at presentation (P < 0.007) but did not
result from BRAF V600E mutation. Global hypomethylation of LINE-1 elements was
observed in tumors compared with normal adrenal samples (P < 0.02).
CONCLUSION: We here describe the identification of CIMP in abdominal
paragangliomas and a strong association of this phenotype with malignant
behavior, as well as young age at presentation. The findings raise a prospective 
for potential benefits of epigenetically acting drugs for a subgroup of young
abdominal paraganglioma patients with adverse prognosis.

TP73 encodes for two proteins: full-length TAp73 and DeltaNp73, which have little
transcriptional activity and exert dominant-negative function towards TP53 and
TAp73. We compared TATP73 and DeltaNTP73 expression in acute myeloid leukaemia
(AML) samples and normal CD34(+) progenitors. Both forms were more highly
expressed in leukaemic cells. Amongst AML blasts, TATP73 was more expressed in
AML harbouring the recurrent genetic abnormalities (RGA): PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1
and CBFB-MYH11, whereas higher DeltaNTP73 expression was detected in non-RGA
cases. TP53 expression did not vary according to DeltaNTP73/TATP73 expression
ratio. Leukaemic cells with higher DeltaNTP73/TATP73 ratios were significantly
more resistant to cytarabine-induced apoptosis.

p73, a member of the p53 family, exhibits activities similar to those of p53,
including the ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. p73 influences
chemotherapeutic responses in human cancer patients, in association with p53.
Alternative splicing of the TP73 gene produces many p73 C- and N-terminal
isoforms, which vary in their transcriptional activity towards p53-responsive
promoters. In this paper, we show that the C-terminal spliced isoforms of the p73
protein differ in their DNA-binding capacity, but this is not an accurate
predictor of transcriptional activity. In different p53-null cell lines, p73beta 
induces either mitochondrial-associated or death receptor-mediated apoptosis, and
these differences are reflected in different gene expression profiles. In
addition, p73 induces cell cycle arrest and p21(WAF1) expression in H1299 cells, 
but not in Saos-2. This data shows that TAp73 isoforms act differently depending 
on the tumour cell background, and have important implications for p73-mediated
therapeutic responses in individual human cancer patients.

Contribution of p53, p63, and p73 to the developmental diseases and cancer.

Tumor suppressor TP53 gene is one of the most mutated genes in human genome.
Inactivating somatic mutations and disruption of p53 protein have been described 
in almost all human malignancies. Its inactivation by germline mutation leads to 
the rare but severe familial precancerosis termed Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This
syndrome is characterized by the early onset of different types of cancers
including soft-tissue sarcomas, breast and brain cancers, leukemias, lung,
laryngeal cancers, and adrenocortical carcinomas. The key role of p53 in tumor
suppression has been confirmed in animal models as well. The p53 -knock-out and
knock-in animals were born alive but were tumor prone. In the late nineties, two 
genes with high homology with TP53 were discovered, TP73 and TP63, respectively. 
Animal models showed that p73 is an important player in neurogenesis, sensory
pathways and homeostatic control. The p63 is critical for the development of
stratified epithelial tissues such as epidermis, breast, and prostate. Despite
the structural similarities with p53, the function of these proteins in
tumorigenesis is controversial. On one hand, there are evidences that both, p63
and p73-deficient animals are not tumor prone; on the other hand, there is
evidence that such animals develop tumors later during their life. Unlike in TP53
gene, mutations in TP63 and TP73 genes are rare, however, germline mutations in
TP63 are linked to the human developmental diseases. In this minireview, we
describe the contribution of the p53, p63, and p73 to human pathology with
emphasis on their different roles in development and tumorigenesis.

DNp73 a matter of cancer: mechanisms and clinical implications.

Center, University of Rostock Medical School, Schillingallee 69, 18055 Rostock,
Germany.

The p53 family proteins carry on a wide spectrum of biological functions from
differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity of tumors.
NH2-terminally truncated p73 (referred to as DNp73) acts as a potent inhibitor of
all these tumor suppressor properties, implying that it has oncogenic functions
in human tumorigenesis. This was favored by the observation that high DNp73
expression levels in a variety of cancers are associated with adverse
clinico-pathological characteristics and the response failure to chemotherapy.
The actual challenge is the deciphering of the molecular mechanisms by which
DNp73 promotes malignancy and to unravel the regulatory pathways for controlling 
TP73 isoform expression. This review is focused on recent findings leaving no
doubt that N-terminally truncated p73 proteins are operative during oncogenesis, 
thus underscoring its significance as a marker for disease severity in patients
and as target for cancer therapy.

PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition that
predisposes to benign and malignant tumors. The lifetime risk of a malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in NF1 is approximately 10%. These tumors
have a poor survival rate and their molecular basis remains unclear. We report
the first comprehensive investigation of DNA copy number across multitude of
genes in NF1 tumors using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH), with the aim to identify molecular signatures that delineate malignant
from benign NF1 tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We constructed an exon-level resolution microarray
encompassing 57 selected genes and profiled DNA from 35 MPNSTs, 16 plexiform, and
8 dermal neurofibromas. Bioinformatic analysis was done on array CGH data to
identify concurrent aberrations in malignant tumors.
RESULTS: The array CGH profiles of MPNSTs and neurofibromas were markedly
different. A number of MPNST-specific alterations were identified, including
amplifications of ITGB4, PDGFRA, MET, TP73, and HGF plus deletions in NF1,
HMMR/RHAMM, MMP13, L1CAM2, p16INK4A/CDKN2A, and TP53. Copy number changes of
HMMR/RHAMM, MMP13, p16INK4A/CDKN2A, and ITGB4 were observed in 46%, 43%, 39%, and
32%, respectively of the malignant tumors, implicating these genes in MPNST
pathogenesis. Concomitant amplifications of HGF, MET, and PDGFRA genes were also 
revealed in MPNSTs, suggesting the putative role of p70S6K pathway in NF1 tumor
progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of array CGH in identifying
novel diagnostic markers for MPNSTs.

Disregulation of imprinted genes can be associated with tumorigenesis and altered
cell differentiation capacity and so could provide adverse outcomes for stem cell
applications. Although the maintenance of mouse and primate embryonic stem cells 
in a pluripotent state has been reported to disrupt the monoallelic expression of
several imprinted genes, available data have suggested relatively higher imprint 
stability in the human equivalents. Identification of 202 heterozygous loci
allowed us to examine the allelic expression of 22 imprinted genes in 22 human
embryonic stem cell lines. Half of the genes examined (IPW, H19, MEG3, MEST
isoforms 1 and 2, PEG10, MESTIT1, NESP55, ATP10A, PHLDA2, IGF2) showed variable
allelic expression between lines, indicating vulnerability to disrupted
imprinting. However, seven genes showed consistent monoallelic expression (NDN,
MAGEL2, SNRPN, PEG3, KCNQ1, KCNQ1OT1, CDKN1C). Furthermore, four genes known to
be monoallelic or to exhibit polymorphic imprinting in later-developing human
tissues (TP73, IGF2R, WT1, SLC22A18) were always biallelic in hESCs. MEST isoform
1, PEG10, and NESP55 showed an association between the variability observed in
interline allelic expression status and the DNA methylation of previously
identified regulatory regions. Our results demonstrate gene-specific differences 
in the stability of imprinted loci in human embryonic stem cells and identify
disrupted DNA methylation as one potential mechanism. We conclude the prudence of
including comprehensive imprinting analysis in the continued characterization of 
human embryonic stem cell lines.

Previously, we have developed a unique in vitro LNCaP cell model, which includes 
androgen-dependent (LNCaP-C33), androgen-independent (LNCaP-C81) and an
intermediate phenotype (LNCaP-C51) cell lines resembling the stages of prostate
cancer progression to hormone independence. This model is advantageous in
overcoming the heterogeneity associated with the prostate cancer up to a certain 
extent. We characterized and compared the gene expression profiles in LNCaP-C33
(androgen-dependent) and LNCaP-C81 (androgen-independent) cells using Affymetrix 
GeneChip array analyses. Multiple genes were identified exhibiting differential
expression during androgen-independent progression. Among the important genes
upregulated in androgen-independent cells were PCDH7, TPTE, TSPY, EPHA3, HGF,
MET, EGF, TEM8, etc., whereas many candidate tumor suppressor genes (HTATIP2,
CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN1C, TP53, TP73, ICAM1, SOCS1/2, SPRY2, PPP2CA, PPP3CA, etc.) 
were decreased. Pathway prediction analysis identified important gene networks
associated with growth-promoting and apoptotic signaling that were perturbed
during androgen-independent progression. Further investigation of one of the
genes, PPP2CA, which encodes the catalytic subunit of a serine phosphatase PP2A, 
a potent tumor suppressor, revealed that its expression was decreased in prostate
cancer compared to adjacent normal/benign tissue. Furthermore, the downregulated 
expression of PPP2CA was significantly correlated with tumor stage and Gleason
grade. Future studies on the identified differentially expressed genes and
signaling pathways may be helpful in understanding the biology of prostate cancer
progression and prove useful in developing novel prognostic biomarkers and
therapy for androgen-refractory prostate cancer.

We aimed to link DNA methylation events occurring in cervical carcinomas to
distinct stages of HPV-induced transformation. Methylation specific-multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) analysis of cervical carcinomas 
revealed promoter methylation of 12 out of 29 tumour suppressor genes analysed,
with MGMT being most frequently methylated (92%). Subsequently, consecutive
stages of HPV16/18-transfected keratinocytes (n=11), ranging from pre-immortal to
anchorage-independent phenotypes, were analysed by MS-MLPA. Whereas no
methylation was evident in pre-immortal cells, progression to anchorage
independence was associated with an accumulation of frequent methylation events
involving five genes, all of which were also methylated in cervical carcinomas.
TP73 and ESR1 methylation became manifest in early immortal cells followed by
RARbeta and DAPK1 methylation in late immortal passages. Complementary
methylation of MGMT was related to anchorage independence. Analysis of nine
cervical cancer cell lines, representing the tumorigenic phenotype, revealed in
addition to these five genes frequent methylation of CADM1, CDH13 and CHFR. In
conclusion, eight recurrent methylation events in cervical carcinomas could be
assigned to different stages of HPV-induced transformation. Hence, our in vitro
model system provides a valuable tool to further functionally address the
epigenetic alterations that are common in cervical carcinomas.

The human p73 protein is essential for normal morphogenesis and maintenance of
neural tissue. Recently, several TP73 transcripts have been revealed in
medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Here, we
performed immunohistochemical analysis on 29 MB specimens using anti-p73alpha and
anti-DeltaNp73 antibodies. Real-time PCR quantification was performed to assess
TAp73 and DeltaNp73 transcripts in a subset of 13 MB samples. Normal cerebellar
tissues and RNA were used for comparison. Pilot clinical-pathological
correlations were also provided. We report significant differences for TAp73 and 
DeltaNp73 mRNA expression between tumor tissues and reference (P = 0.013, P =
0.028). Immunohistochemically, 52 and 29% MB samples were positive for p73alpha
and DeltaNp73, respectively. p73alpha expression was found to be in both the
nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas DeltaNp73 was localized predominantly in the
cytoplasm. In normal cerebellum, positive staining for p73alpha and DeltaNp73 was
observed in the Purkinje cells of newborns, not adult samples, which supports the
developmental role of TP73 during organogenesis of the human cerebellum. Survival
analysis has shown negative relationship of DeltaNp73-immunoreactivity with
overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) (P = 0.026 and P = 0.127,
respectively). For p73alpha-positive cases, the negative trend in OS (P = 0.149) 
and EFS (P = 0.216) was also apparent. Our results indicate the involvement of
p73 protein in MB tumorigenesis and define TP73 as a potential prognostic and
therapeutic target for medulloblastoma.

BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of
childhood. Children who relapse usually die of their disease, which reflects
resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in outcome require a
better understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma growth and
treatment response. TP73 is a member of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene family
that has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors and mediates
apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. In this study, we assessed expression of
TP73 RNA species in patient tumor specimens and in medulloblastoma cell lines,
and manipulated expression of full-length TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated
DeltaNp73 to assess their effects on growth.
METHODS: We analyzed medulloblastoma samples from thirty-four pediatric patients 
and the established medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy and D283MED, for expression 
of TP73 RNA including the full-length transcript and the 5'-terminal variants
that encode the DeltaNp73 isoform, as well as TP53 RNA using quantitative real
time-RTPCR. Protein expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 was quantitated with
immunoblotting methods. Clinical outcome was analyzed based on TP73 RNA and p53
protein expression. To determine effects of overexpression or knock-down of TAp73
and DeltaNp73 on cell cycle and apoptosis, we analyzed transiently transfected
medulloblastoma cell lines with flow cytometric and TUNEL methods.
RESULTS: Patient medulloblastoma samples and cell lines expressed full-length and
5'-terminal variant TP73 RNA species in 100-fold excess compared to
non-neoplastic brain controls. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed their
elevated levels of TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 proteins.
Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed trends toward favorable overall and
progression-free survival of patients whose tumors display TAp73 RNA
overexpression. Overexpression of TAp73 or DeltaNp73 induced apoptosis under
basal growth conditions in vitro and sensitized them to cell death in response to
chemotherapeutic agents.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that primary medulloblastomas express
significant levels of TP73 isoforms, and suggest that they can modulate the
survival and genotoxic responsiveness of medulloblastomas cells.

Korea, Seoul, Korea.

Our aim was to identify novel genomic regions of interest and provide highly
dynamic range information on correlation between squamous cell cervical carcinoma
and its related gene expression patterns by a genome-wide array-based comparative
genomic hybridization (array-CGH). We analyzed 15 cases of cervical cancer from
KangNam St Mary's Hospital of the Catholic University of Korea. Microdissection
assay was performed to obtain DNA samples from paraffin-embedded cervical tissues
of cancer as well as of the adjacent normal tissues. The bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) array used in this study consisted of 1440 human BACs and the
space among the clones was 2.08 Mb. All the 15 cases of cervical cancer showed
the differential changes of the cervical cancer-associated genetic alterations.
The analysis limit of average gains and losses was 53%. A significant positive
correlation was found in 8q24.3, 1p36.32, 3q27.1, 7p21.1, 11q13.1, and 3p14.2
changes through the cervical carcinogenesis. The regions of high level of gain
were 1p36.33-1p36.32, 8q24.3, 16p13.3, 1p36.33, 3q27.1, and 7p21.1. And the
regions of homozygous loss were 2q12.1, 22q11.21, 3p14.2, 6q24.3, 7p15.2, and
11q25. In the high level of gain regions, GSDMDC1, RECQL4, TP73, ABCF3, ALG3,
HDAC9, ESRRA, and RPS6KA4 were significantly correlated with cervical cancer. The
genes encoded by frequently lost clones were PTPRG, GRM7, ZDHHC3, EXOSC7, LRP1B, 
and NR3C2. Therefore, array-CGH analyses showed that specific genomic alterations
were maintained in cervical cancer that were critical to the malignant phenotype 
and may give a chance to find out possible target genes present in the gained or 
lost clones.

p73 belongs to a family of transcription factors, including p53 and p63, that
mediate response to DNA damage and cellular stress by inducing DNA repair, cell
cycle arrest, and apoptosis. TP73 gene contains two promotors and several splice 
variants resulting in up to 24 possible permutations of p73 proteins which
underlies the complexity of the family and its regulatory mechanisms. p73
variants lacking the N-terminal, denoted as DeltaTAp73, are not transcriptionally
competent and they act in a dominant negative fashion over TAp73. DeltaTAp73
isoforms can be generated by alternative promotor usage, giving rise to
DeltaNp73, or alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 or 2, and 3 together. Such
transcript isoforms potentially produce oncogenic proteins and they were shown to
be present in primary tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. We investigated the
possibility of additional mechanisms by which p73 protein could be regulated and 
discovered a putative internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in exon 2. Translation 
initiation of TAp73 mRNA results in a DeltaNp73-like peptide, thus demonstrating 
an additional mechanism whereby a DeltaTA p73 protein is produced from a
transcript originally generated from the P1 promotor of the p73 gene.

CONTEXT: Previous chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies of 
papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have demonstrated a low prevalence of
aberrations, with the majority of tumors showing no evidence of chromosomal
instability. The technique of CGH can be optimized, however, using array CGH and 
laser capture microdissection to ensure pure cell populations for analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess PTC using array CGH applied to laser capture microdissected 
tumor cells and pure cell cultures.
DESIGN: Well-characterized PTC (known ret/PTC and BRAF mutation status),
including samples from 5 tumors with classic morphology, 3 follicular variant
tumors, and 3 clonal PTC cell lines, were analyzed.
RESULTS: Copy gain and loss occurred in all of the tumor cases and cell lines
examined. The most common recurrent aberrations involved gains on chromosomes 1, 
5, 7, 11, 15, 17, and 22, with recurrent deletions occurring on chromosomes 4,
18, and 19. Analysis of the data from the 8 tumor samples showed that
amplifications of TP73 (1p36.33), SNRPN (15q12), and PDGFB (22q13.1) occurred
exclusively in tumors with a wild type BRAF.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a higher prevalence of aberrations detected using
array CGH allied to laser capture microdissection than previously described in
the literature, and it appears that the combination of laser capture
microdissection and arrayed clones optimizes studies utilizing CGH. Copy gain of 
PDGFB occurs in a subset of tumors showing no evidence of mutated BRAF or
rearranged ret, suggesting that copy gain of PDGFB may underlie the increased
expression of platelet-derived growth factor described recently in the
literature.

Glial tumours are a devastating, poorly understood condition carrying a gloomy
prognosis for which clinicians sorely lack reliable predictive parameters
facilitating a sound treatment strategy. Tp73, a p53 family member, expresses two
main classes of isoforms--transactivatory activity (TA)p73 and
DeltaTAp73--exhibiting tumour suppressor gene and oncogene properties,
respectively. The authors examined their expression status in high- and low-grade
adult gliomas. Isoform-specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction was used for the analysis of Tp73 isoform transcript expression in a
series of 51 adult patients harbouring glial tumours, in order to compare tumour 
grades with each other, and with non-tumoural samples obtained from epileptic
patients as well. Our data demonstrate increase of TAp73 and DeltaTAp73
transcript levels at onset and early stage of the disease. We also show that
DeltaEx2-3 isoform expression in low-grade tumours anticipates clinical and
imaging progression to higher grades, and correlates to the patients' survival.
Expression levels of P1 promoter generated Tp73 isoforms--and particularly
DeltaEx2-3--indeed allow for prediction of the clinical progression of low-grade 
gliomas in adults. Our data are the first such molecular biology report regarding
low-grade tumours and as such should be of help for sound decision-making.

Regulating p73 isoforms in human tumours.

Medical School, Dundee, UK. p.j.coates@dundee.ac.uk

Although mutations in the TP73 gene are extremely rare in human tumours, altered 
expression is common. In some tumours, most notably leukaemias and lymphomas,
expression of TP73 is reduced, suggesting a tumour suppressor role. In contrast, 
TP73 is over-expressed in many other tumour types, implying that it has oncogenic
functions in human tumourigenesis. These conflicting scenarios can be reconciled 
by the observations that the TP73 gene produces p53-like isoforms (TAp73) and
anti-p53 isoforms (DeltaTAp73). Thus, loss of TAp73 or over-expression of
DeltaTAp73 should each promote oncogenic transformation, and the balance of
expression of the opposing isoforms is the crucial factor. The mechanisms that
regulate expression of TP73 isoforms are therefore of great interest. Recent data
provide evidence for interacting roles of ZEB1, p300, and a polymorphic 73 bp
deletion in intron 1 of the human TP73 gene in this process. Importantly,
alterations to the proposed regulatory pathway for controlling TP73 isoform
expression in colorectal cancer are associated with adverse clinico-pathological 
characteristics. Because p73 is also associated with tumour chemosensitivity,
these new findings should provide prognostic information and have the potential
to guide future therapeutic decisions.

Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of death among Mexican women >35 years 
of age. At the molecular level, changes in many genetic pathways have been
reported to be associated with this neoplasm. To analyze these changes, we
determined gene expression profiles and chromosomal structural alterations in
tumors from Mexican women. We obtained mRNA to identify expression profiles with 
microarray technology, and DNA to determine amplifications and deletions, in 10
fresh sporadic breast tumor biopsies without treatment, as well as in 10
nonaffected breast tissues. Expression profiles were compared with genetic
changes observed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). We compared the
expression profiles against the structural alterations from the studied genes by 
means of microarrays; at least 17 of these genes correlated with DNA copy number 
alterations. We found that the following genes were overexpressed: LAMC1, PCTK3, 
CCNC, CCND1, FGF3, PCTK2, L1CAM, BGN, and PLXNB3 (alias PLEXR). Underexpressed
genes included CASP9, FGR, TP73, HSPG2, and ERCC1; genes turned off included
FRAP1, EPHA2 (previously ECK), IL12A, E2F5, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF10A, EFNB3, and
BCL2. The results will allow us, in the near future, to outline genes that could 
serve as diagnostic, prognostic, or target therapy markers for the Mexican
population.

p73, a transcription factor rarely mutated in cancer, regulates a subset of p53
target genes that cause cells to respond to genotoxic stress by growth arrest and
apoptosis. p73 is produced in two main forms; only TAp73 reiterates the roles of 
p53, while DeltaNp73 can be oncogenic in character. We show that the TAp73 form
produced by TP73 P1 promoter has five distinct Egr1-binding sites, each
contributing to the transcriptional upregulation of TAp73 by Egr1 in several cell
types. In contrast, TP73 P2 promoter transcribes DeltaNp73, is not induced by
Egr1, but is induced by TAp73 and p53. Induction of TAp73 by genotoxic stress
requires Egr1 in mouse in vivo. Newly discovered non-consensus p53-binding sites 
in p73, p53 and Egr1 promoters reveal inter-regulating networks and sustained
expression by feedback loops in response to stress, resulting in prolonged
expression of the p53 family of genes and efficient apoptosis.

HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to examine the DNA methylation profile 
of several genes in a series of vestibular schwannomas, and to analyze its
relationship with clinical and radiological features.
BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of promoter regions is a major mechanism for
silencing of tumor suppressor genes in several tumors. There is limited
information about methylation status in vestibular schwannoma, with no clinical
or radiological implications described to date.
METHODS: The methylation status of 16 tumor-related genes including RASSF1A,
RAR-B, VHL, PTEN, HMLH1, RB1, TP16, CASP8, ER, TIMP3, MGMT, DAPK, TP73, GSTP1,
TP14, and THBS1 was examined in a series of 22 vestibular schwannomas.The
bisulfite modification of genomic DNA was performed. Clinical and radiological
features were compared with the methylation results.
RESULTS: Methylation values from 9% to 27% were found in 12 of 16 genes tested,
including RASSF1A, VHL, PTEN, TP16, CASP8, TIMP3, MGMT, DAPK, THBS1, HMLH1, TP73,
and GSTP1. A significant association was found between CASP8 and RASSF1A
methylation. Methylation of CASP8 was associated with the patient's age and the
tumor size. Methylation of TP73 was associated with hearing loss. RASSF1A
methylation was inversely correlated with the clinical growth index.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant methylation of tumor-related genes may play a role in the
development of vestibular schwannomas. Our results may provide useful clues to
the development of prognostic assays for these tumors.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the promoter methylation status of the 22 cancer genes and 
their contribution to disease progression in 6 head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines.
DESIGN: A panel of 41 gene probes, designed to interrogate 35 unique genes with
known associations to cancer including HNSCC, was interrogated for alterations in
gene copy number and aberrant methylation status (22 genes) using the
methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay.
SUBJECTS: Primary (A) and recurrent or metastatic (B) HNSCC cell lines
UMSCC-11A/11B, UMSCC-17A/17B, and UMSCC-81A/81B are described.
RESULTS: Nine genes, TIMP3, APC, KLK10, TP73, CDH13, IGSF4, FHIT, ESR1, and
DAPK1, were aberrantly methylated. The most frequently hypermethylated genes were
APC and IGSF4, observed in 3 of 6 cell lines, and TP73 and DAPK1, observed in 2
of 6. For KLK10 and IGSF4, TIMP3 and FHIT, and TP73, in UMSCC-11B, UMSCC-17B, and
UMSCC-81B, respectively, promoter hypermethylation was a disease progression
event, indicating complete abrogation of tumor suppressor function for KLK10,
IGSF4, and TIMP3 and gene silencing of 1 of 2 copies of TP73. Hypermethylation of
IGSF4, TP73, CDH13, ESR1, DAPK1, and APC were primary events in UMSCC-17A.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene silencing through promoter hypermethylation was observed in 5
of 6 cell lines and contributed to primary and progressive events in HNSCC. In
addition to genetic alterations of gains and losses, epigenetic events appear to 
further undermine a destabilized genomic repertoire in HNSCC.

PURPOSE: Although full-length TAp73 variants largely mimic p53 suppressor
activities, the transactivation-deficient transcripts DeltaTAp73 exert an
oncogenic effect by inactivating p53 and TAp73 suppressor properties.
Additionally, DeltaTAp73 may cooperate with oncogenic RAS to induce cell
transformation, confer drug resistance, and induce the phosphorylation of
phosphorylated Rb. Here, we study the expression of TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 variants
and assess possible associations with E2F-1, p53 and K-ras status. We address the
possible clinical relevance of alterations in these genes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determine in 113 colon and 60 breast cancer patients (a)
the expression levels of TAp73, DeltaTAp73 (DeltaEx2p73, DeltaEx2/3p73, and
DeltaNp73), and E2F-1 transcripts by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (b) mutations in the first exon of K-ras by
PCR-single-stranded confirmational polymorphism; and (c) p53 status by
immunohistochemistry. Tumor characteristics were examined in each patient.
RESULTS: Both suppressor and oncogenic isoforms of TP73 were significantly
coupregulated in tumor tissues. Associations were observed between (a) p53 wild
type status and upregulation of some TP73 variants; (b) overexpression of E2F-1
and some TP73 forms; and (c) upregulation of DeltaTAp73 variants and advanced
pathologic stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, presence of polyps,
and tumor localization.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of TP73 variants in tumor tissues indicates that they 
may be involved in colon and breast carcinogenesis. The association between
upregulation of DeltaTAp73 isoforms and poor prognosis features, specifically
advanced tumor stage, suggests that they may be of practical clinical prognostic 
value. Interestingly, the in vivo associations identified here may indicate a
functional network involving p73 variants, p53, and E2F-1.

Milétrie, Avenue du Recteur Pineau, 86021 Poitiers Cedex, France.

AIM: This study was aimed to determine p73 status in thyroid tumours.
METHODS: Differential expression of the TAp73, DeltaTAp73 transcripts was
measured in a panel of 60 thyroid malignancies by quantitative RT-PCR.
RESULTS: By comparison to normal thyroid tissue surrounding the tumours, we
observed significant downregulation of TP73 transcripts in adenomas and in
differentiated carcinomas. Correlations were found in normal tissue specimens
between the expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 transcripts and that of p53, p14ARF
p16INK4a, but these correlations were lost in carcinomas (PTC or FTC).
CONCLUSIONS: We have found significant variations of TAp73, DeltaNp73, p53,
p14ARF p16INK4a, expressions and correlations between the expressions of those
different genes in thyroid cancer.

DF, Clark DP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.

PURPOSE: Anal intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with human papillomavirus
infection and may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is
increasing in immunocompromised patients. We hypothesize that anal
intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with abnormal DNA methylation and that
detection of these events may be used to improve screening programs.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventy-six patients were identified who underwent anal
cytology screening and subsequent biopsy at our institution between 1999 and
2004. The specimens from these patients included 184 anal biopsies [normal, n =
57; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), n = 74; high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), n = 41; and invasive SCC, n = 12] and 37 residual 
liquid-based anal cytology specimens (normal, n = 11; LSIL, n = 12; HSIL, n =
14). The methylation status of the following genes was determined for each biopsy
and cytology sample using real-time methylation-specific PCR: HIC1, RASSF1, RARB,
CDKN2A, p14, TP73, APC, MLH1, MGMT, DAPK1, and IGSF4.
RESULTS: Methylation-specific PCR analysis of biopsy samples revealed that DNA
methylation was more common in SCC and HSIL than LSIL and normal mucosa.
Specifically, methylation of IGSF4 and DAPK1 was prevalent in SCC (75% and 75% of
cases, respectively) and HSIL (59% and 71%, respectively) but was absent in LSIL 
and normal biopsy samples. Methylation profiles of cytologic samples were similar
to those found in the biopsy samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent event in anal HSIL and SCC.
Methylation of IGSF4 and DAPK1 is specific for HSIL and SCC, and may serve as a
useful molecular biomarker.

School, University of Newcastle, Framlington Place, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4HH,

To investigate the role of aberrant epigenetic events in ependymoma and identify 
critical genes in its pathogenesis, the methylation status of nine tumour
suppressor genes (TSGs: p14(ARF), p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), CASP8, MGMT, TIMP3,
TP73, RB1 and RASSF1A) was assessed. Extensive hypermethylation across the
RASSF1A CpG island was detected frequently in ependymomas of all clinical and
pathological disease subtypes (86% of cases, n=35), but not in non-neoplastic
brain tissues (n=6). Less frequent methylation was observed for CASP8, MGMT and
TP73 (5-20%). The remaining TSGs showed no evidence of methylation. RASSF1A
hypermethylation represents the most common gene-specific defect identified in
ependymoma highlighting the importance of its further investigation in this
disease.

Ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743; Yondelis, Trabectedin) is a marine anticancer agent
that induces long-lasting objective remissions and tumor control in a subset of
patients with pretreated/resistant soft-tissue sarcoma. Drug-induced tumor
control is achievable in 22% of such patients, but there is no clear indication
of the molecular features correlated with clinical sensitivity/resistance to
ET-743. Nine low-passage, soft-tissue sarcoma cell lines, explanted from
chemo-naive patients with different patterns of sensitivity, have been profiled
with a cDNA microarray containing 6,700 cancer-related genes. The molecular
signature of these cell lines was analyzed at baseline and at four different
times after ET-743 exposure. The association of levels of TP53 mutation and TP73 
expression with ET-743 sensitivity and cell cycle kinetics after treatment was
also analyzed. Gene expression profile analysis revealed up-regulation of 86
genes and down-regulation of 244 genes in response to ET-743. The ET-743 gene
expression signature identified a group of genes related with cell cycle control,
stress, and DNA-damage response (JUNB, ATF3, CS-1, SAT, GADD45B, and ID2) that
were up-regulated in all the cell lines studied. The transcriptional signature 72
hours after ET-743 administration, associated with ET-743 sensitivity, showed a
more efficient induction of genes involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis, 
such as RAD17, BRCA1, PAR4, CDKN1A, and P53DINP1, in the sensitive cell line
group. The transcriptional signature described here may lead to the
identification of ET-743 downstream mediators and transcription regulators and
the proposal of strategies by which ET-743-sensitive tumors may be identified.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic
variation. Their abundance and the ease with which they can be assayed have lead 
to their use in applications beyond simple genotyping. One such application is
the quantitative determination of transcript levels associated with distinct
alleles or haplotypes found in promoters and coding regions of genes. These
changes in expression due to allelic variation are often associated with
additional genomic or transcript modifications such as DNA methylation or RNA
editing. Here, we describe the use of an integrated genetic analysis platform,
based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
to first, discover coding SNPs (cSNPs); second, use these cSNPs to identify and
analyze allele-specific expression; and third, from this knowledge to further
analyze methylation patterns as a putative cause for the allele-specific
expression. An established model involving allele-specific expression profiles of
the human tumor protein 73 (TP73) gene is presented as an example to outline and 
validate data obtained from the MassARRAY platform. The availability of a single 
integrated platform to assay stable and dynamic variation at the genomic and
transcript level greatly simplifies complex functional genomic studies.

Mechanism of induction of apoptosis by p73 and its relevance to neuroblastoma
biology.

Rossi M(1), Sayan AE, Terrinoni A, Melino G, Knight RA.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Leicester, United Kingdom.

TP73, as a TP53 homologue, drew the attention of tumor biologists because it is
rarely mutated in human cancers and can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by
activating genes also regulated by p53. However, TP73 harbors an additional
promoter that produces a dominant negative p73 protein (deltaNp73) having the
opposite effect of the TAp73 protein. Thus, the regulation of p53 responsive
genes in the absence of p53 relies on a critical balance between different p73
gene-derived proteins. Recent reports have described additional complexity in the
mechanism of action of transcriptionally active p73 (TAp73) in the induction of
cell death. The molecular mechanism through which p73 induces apoptosis involves 
(i) expression and changes in subcellular localization of scotin, producing an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; and (ii) transactivation of PUMA and Bax, thus
determining cell fate. On the contrary, deltaNp73 inhibits apoptosis, thus
contributing to the oncogenic potential of neuroblastoma cells.

microsatellite analysis.

Recurrent chromosomal gain at 1q is one of the most common features of human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but how the gain at 1q contributes to
hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. To identify the target genes, precise
determination of the shortest region of overlap (SRO) and of breakpoints is
necessary. Similarly, the role of loss at 1p, which is also a major cytogenetic
aberration in HCC, needs to be determined. Fifty HCCs were examined with the aid 
of 59 microsatellite markers distributed throughout both arms of chromosome 1. To
detect allelic gain effectively, the cutoff value of the allelic imbalance index 
was set at 0.70. Alleles showing imbalance were subjected to multiplex PCR, using
a retained allele as an internal control, to determine whether the imbalance was 
the result of chromosomal gain or loss. The SRO of the gains was defined as
D1S2878-D1S2619 (1q23.-q25.3, 16.9 Mb), which involved 36 cases (72%). Gains in
the number of copies of certain oncogenes within this region seemed to be
critical for the pathogenesis of HCC. In contrast, the centromeric breakpoints of
these gains varied, but they tended to occur mainly in the pericentromeric region
(26 of 50 cases, 52%). Rearrangement of specific genes associated with the gains 
is unlikely. On the other hand, the SRO of deletion was defined as D1S2893-D1S450
(1p36.32-p36.22, 5.1 Mb). Four known putative tumor-suppressor genes (TP73, RIZ1,
NBL1/DAN, and CDKN2C) were outside the SRO, suggesting the presence of other
candidate genes with critical roles in hepatocarcinogenesis.

Systematic multiplex polymerase chain reaction and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of changes in copy number and
expression of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in cancer tissues and
cell lines.

Systematic multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (SM RT-PCR) 
is distinguishable from other multiplex RT-PCR methods by (i) utilization of
primers that amplify sequences that fall within a single exon of the genes, (ii) 
utilization of genomic DNA as a calibration standard, and (iii) optimized PCR
conditions that allow amplification of bands of similar intensity using genomic
DNA template. We previously developed the human experimental systems of 68
glycosyltransferase genes, 39 Hox genes, and 26 integrin subunit genes, and
analyzed the expression of those genes in human adult tissues. Here we report the
establishment of an SM RT-PCR system of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes and the analysis of gene expression in human cancer tissues and cell lines.
We also demonstrate that the SM RT-PCR system, which was developed for cDNA
expression analysis, could also be used successfully for more exquisite analysis 
of copy number changes in genomic DNA. We observed a decrease in band intensity
of HRAS, TP73, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B genes in most of the breast and prostate cancer
cell lines examined. The decrease in copy number of HRAS proto-oncogene leads us 
to suspect the presence of tumor suppressor genes in the vicinity of this gene on
chromosome 11p15.5.

Loss of the short arm of chromosome 1 is a hallmark of oligodendroglial tumours
(OTs). Deletion mapping studies in OTs have revealed multiple commonly deleted
regions on chromosome 1p, suggesting that there are more than one tumour
suppressor gene. To map critical deletion regions on 1p, a series of 25 OTs were 
examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 19 polymorphic markers across the 1p
arm using microsatellite analysis. Our study revealed that 60% of tumours had LOH
of all informative markers on 1p and identified one tumour showing LOH at
telomeric markers only. Since this deletion region lies in one of the critical
deletion intervals defined previously, we then screened another series of 27 OTs 
specifically at 1p36.3 for LOH using nine polymorphic markers. A total of 12%
(six out of 52) of tumours were found to carry interstitial deletions. The
allelic status and the deletion breakpoints in these tumours with interstitial
deletion were further verified by fluorescent in situ hybridisation. The small
overlapping intervals facilitated the delineation of two contiguous minimally
deleted regions of 0.76 Mb, defined by D1S468 and D1S2845, and of 0.41 Mb, bound 
by D1S2893 and D1S1608, on 1p36.31-36.32. Based on current reference human genome
sequence these deletion regions have been sequenced almost to entirety and
contain eight annotated genes. TP73, DFFB and SHREW1 are the only known genes
located in these deletion regions, while the others are uncharacterised novel
genes. In conclusion, our study has narrowed down the critical tumour suppressor 
loci on 1p36.3, in which two minimally deleted regions are mapped, and markedly
reduced the number of candidate genes to be screened for their involvement in OT 
development.

p73 expression for human buccal epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma:
does it correlate with nodal status of carcinoma and is there a relationship with
malignant change of epithelial dysplasia?

Chen YK(1), Hsue SS, Lin LM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Kaohsiung Medical
University, 100 Shih-Chuan 1st Road, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: TP73, a p53 homologue gene, shares similar structural sequences with 
p53. The aim of this study was to investigate the p73 expression for human buccal
epithelial dysplasia (ED) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
METHODS: Seventy-five samples of human buccal ED, including mild, moderate, and
severe ED (25 samples in each category), were analyzed for p73 protein expression
by means of immunohistochemistry. Twenty-five samples of human buccal SCCs were
analyzed for p73 mRNA expression with reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and were also analyzed for protein expression with
immunohistochemical analysis.
RESULTS: By use of immunohistochemical analysis, nuclear staining of p73 protein 
was detected in a subset of normal mucosa, buccal ED, and SCC specimens. p73
nuclear staining was noted for the basal cells of normal buccal mucosa. For
buccal lesions deriving from mild, moderate, and severe ED, p73 protein was
observed in basal and parabasal layers and in more superficial cell layers
corresponding to the spinous layer. For well-differentiated carcinomas, p73
immunoreactivity was chiefly observed among the less-differentiated cells in the 
periphery of carcinomatous clusters, whereas moderately differentiated carcinomas
revealed homogeneous staining, involving nearly all of the tumor cells. On
RT-PCR, the expression of p73 mRNA from buccal SCC was noted to be compatible
with the findings of immunohistochemical analysis. An electrophoretic band with a
180-bp PCR product corresponding to p73 mRNA has been observed. The expression of
p73 seemed to be significantly elevated for specimens of buccal ED (protein
level) and SCC (protein and mRNA levels) compared with the analogous expression
for normal control tissue (Fisher's exact test, p <.001). Also, p73 expression
(protein and mRNA levels) correlated significantly with cervical lymph node
metastasis for cases of buccal SCC (Fisher's exact test, p <.001). Eight cases of
ED (protein level) showing p73 positivity have undergone malignant transformation
to develop SCCs in 2 years follow-up, but no statistical significance was
established (Fisher's exact test, p >.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that p73 expression may be (1) associated with the 
differentiation of oral stratified squamous epithelium, (2) an early event in
human oral carcinogenesis, and (3) associated with the nodal status of patients
with oral carcinoma and a possible indicator for malignant change of oral ED.

Allelic imbalance at 1p36 may predict prognosis of chemoradiation therapy for
bladder preservation in patients with invasive bladder cancer.

Invasive bladder cancers have been treated by irradiation combined with
cis-platinum (CDDP) as a bladder preservative option. The aim of this study was
to find a marker for predicting patient outcome as well as clinical response
after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) by investigating allelic loss of
apoptosis-related genes. A total of 67 transitional cell carcinomas of the
bladder treated by CRT (median dose: 32.4 Gy of radiation and 232 mg of CDDP)
were studied. We investigated allelic imbalances at 14 loci on chromosomes 17p13 
and 1p36 including the p53 and p73 gene regions by fluorescent multiplex PCR
based on DNA from paraffin-embedded tumour specimens and peripheral blood. The
response to CRT was clinical response (CR) in 21 patients (31%), partial response
(PR) in 31 (46%), and no change(NC) in 15 (22%). There was no statistical
correlation between treatment response and clinical parameters, such as tumour
grade, stage, radiation dose, or CDDP dose. The frequencies of allelic imbalance 
for TP53 and TP73 were 21 and 56%, respectively; neither was correlated with
clinical treatment response and tumour stage or grade. There was no statistical
correlation between treatment response and allelic imbalance at the other 12
loci. We found a significant correlation between cancer-specific survival and an 
imbalance of D1S243 (P=0.0482) or TP73 (P=0.0013) using a Log-rank test, although
other loci including TP53 did not correlate with survival (P=0.4529 Multivariate 
analysis showed performance status (P=0.0047), recurrence (P=0.0017), and
radiation doses (P=0.0468) were independent predictive factors for
cancer-specific survival. However, an allelic imbalance of TP73 was the most
remarkable independent predictive factor of poor patient survival (P=0.0002, risk
ratio: 3382). Our results suggest that the allelic loss of the p73 gene predicts 
a clinical outcome of locally advanced bladder cancer when treated by CRT.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with
a complex range of clinical symptoms. The hallmark of NF1 is the onset of
heterogeneous (dermal or plexiform) benign neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas
can give rise to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and the
underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.
RESULTS: To obtain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, we 
used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA expression of 489
selected genes in MPNSTs, in comparison with plexiform neurofibromas. The
expression of 28 (5.7%) of the 489 genes was significantly different between
MPNSTs and plexiform neurofibromas; 16 genes were upregulated and 12 were
downregulated in MPNSTs. The altered genes were mainly involved in cell
proliferation (MKI67, TOP2A, CCNE2), senescence (TERT, TERC), apoptosis
(BIRC5/Survivin, TP73) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP13, MMP9, TIMP4,
ITGB4). More interestingly, other genes were involved in the Ras signaling
pathway (RASSF2, HMMR/RHAMM) and the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway (DHH, PTCH2).
Several of the down-regulated genes were Schwann cell-specific (L1CAM, MPZ,
S100B, SOX10, ERBB3) or mast cell-specific (CMA1, TPSB), pointing to a depletion 
and/or dedifferentiation of Schwann cells and mast cells during malignant
transformation of plexiform neurofibromas.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a limited number of signaling pathways, and
particularly the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway, may be involved in malignant
transformation of plexiform neurofibromas. Some of the relevant genes or their
products warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in NF1.

p73 and p63: why do we still need them?

Blandino G(1), Dobbelstein M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Experimental Oncology, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome,
Italy.

When p73 and p63 were initially described as homologues of the tumor suppressor
p53, the three family members seemed almost exchangeable, raising the question
why all three were retained during evolution. It later turned out that the
corresponding genes, TP63 and TP73, appear phylogenetically older than TP53, and 
that their targeted deletion causes severe developmental defects, in contrast to 
a deletion of TP53. Hence, p63 and p73 are responsible for biological effects
that cannot be elicited by p53 alone. Here, we provide an overview of properties 
ascribed to p63 and p73 that distinguish them from p53. Differences occur at the 
following levels: (i) protein structure, especially with regard to the
aminoterminal transactivation domains and the carboxyterminal portions unique to 
p63 and p73; (ii) regulation, affecting mRNA levels, posttranslational
modifications and interaction with other cellular proteins; (iii) activities,
resulting in the regulation of gene expression, the programming of development,
and the emergence of tumors. We speculate that, during the course of evolution,
p63 and p73 have first pursued a broader range of activities, whereas p53 later
specialized on genome maintenance.

This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of TP53 
alterations stratified for the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism (c.215G>C, p.Arg72Pro) 
in a cohort of 109 patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas. TP53 sequence
variants were observed in 80 of the 109 (73.4%) tumors and were significantly
associated with grade of differentiation (P=0.001). A tendency towards higher
frequency of sequence variants in tumors with higher FIGO stages was seen
(P=0.05). The type of TP53 sequence variant (transition A:T>G:C vs. G:C>A:T at
CpG dinucleotides, and transversion G:C>T:A) had significant correlation with
patients' age (P=0.04) with more A:T>G:C in patients over 60 years old. No
significant associations were found between frequency of sequence variants and
age at diagnosis, histological type, size of residual tumor after primary
surgery, or long-term survival. Analyses of the codon 72 polymorphism in tumor
DNA gave a higher frequency of homozygosity/hemizygosity than expected from the
population frequency, particularly for the Pro allele. Tumors homozygous or
hemizygous for the Pro allele had significantly higher frequency of TP53 sequence
variants, particularly of the nonmissense type (P=0.002), and patients with these
types of alterations had significantly shorter survival (P=0.04). TP53 protein
accumulation, determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), was found in 67.9% (74
out of 109) of the tumors, was significantly more common among serous than
nonserous ovarian carcinomas (P=0.008), and had a significant effect on
progression-free survival (P=0.03). p63 (TP73L; formerly TP63) and p73 (TP73)
protein accumulation detected by IHC was seen in 67.9 and 0% of the tumors,
respectively. A significantly higher frequency of p63-positive cases was seen
among serous tumors (P=0.008) and tended to increase with increasing FIGO stages 
(P=0.05), but had no significant effect on survival. No association between p63
protein accumulation and TP53 protein accumulation was seen.

TP73 allelic expression in human brain and allele frequencies in Alzheimer's
disease.

BACKGROUND: The p73 protein, a paralogue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is
essential for normal development and survival of neurons. TP73 is therefore of
interest as a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility. TP73
mRNA is transcribed from three promoters, termed P1-P3, and there is evidence for
an additional complexity in its regulation, namely, a variable allelic expression
bias in some human tissues.
METHODS: We utilized RT-PCR/RFLP and direct cDNA sequencing to measure
allele-specific expression of TP73 mRNA, SNP genotyping to assess genetic
associations with AD, and promoter-reporter assays to assess allele-specific TP73
promoter activity.
RESULTS: Using a coding-neutral BanI polymorphism in TP73 exon 5 as an allelic
marker, we found a pronounced allelic expression bias in one adult brain
hippocampus, while 3 other brains (two adult; one fetal) showed approximately
equal expression from both alleles. In a tri-ethnic elderly population of
African-Americans, Caribbean Hispanics and Caucasians, a G/A single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) at -386 in the TP73 P3 promoter was weakly but significantly
associated with AD (crude O.R. for AD given any -386G allele 1.7; C.I. 1.2-2.5;
after adjusting for age and education O.R. 1.5; C.I. 1.1-2.3, N= 1191). The
frequency of the -386G allele varied by ethnicity and was highest in
African-Americans and lowest in Caucasians. No significant differences in basal
P3 promoter activity were detected comparing -386G vs. -386A promoter-luciferase 
constructs in human SK-NSH-N neuroblastoma cells.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a reproducible allelic expression bias in mRNA expression
from the TP73 gene in some, though not all, adult human brains, and
inter-individual variation in regulatory sequences of the TP73 locus may affect
susceptibility to AD. However, additional studies will be necessary to exclude
genetic admixture as an alternative explanation for the observed associations.

Aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands in human genes represents an
alternative mechanism for genetic inactivation, and contributes to the
development of human tumors. Nevertheless, thus far, few reports have analyzed
methylation in ependymomas. We determined the frequency of aberrant CpG island
methylation of several tumor-associated genes: p16(INK4a), RB1, MGMT, DAPK,
TIMP3, THBS1, TP73, NF2 and Caspase 8 in a group of 27 ependymomas, consisting of
22 WHO grade II samples and five anaplastic WHO grade III tumors. The respective 
methylation indices (number of genes methylated/total genes analyzed) for both
tumor groups was 0.195 and 0.198. Overall methylation rates greater than 20% were
detected in MGMT, TIMP3, THBS1 and TP73. NF2 and Caspase 8 each presented
hypermethylation in less than 10% of cases, and the cell-cycle regulators
RB1/p16(INK4a) were hypermethylated in 4% and 18% of the samples, respectively,
mostly affecting the low-grade forms. Our findings suggest that methylation
commonly contributes to the inactivation of cancer-related genes in ependymomas.

Infection with human papillomaviruses (HPV) is essential in the carcinogenesis of
the uterine cervix. However, a complex interrelation between viral and cellular
genes is necessary for cell-cycle control deregulation and development and
progression of cervical cancer induction. The TP73 gene is localized in 1p36.3
band, which is often deleted by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human cancers. We
analyzed the p73 cytosine thymine polymorphism and LOH in this locus by
polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism in 134 DNA
samples from biopsies of 67 primary untreated invasive cervix tumors and the
corresponding peripheral blood. Genotype frequencies of 56.7% for homozygous
genotype GC/GC and 43.3% for heterozygous genotype GC/AT were found. The presence
of the GC/AT genotype in tumors was associated with lower age at menarche
(P=0.039) and high parity (P=0.015). In 20.0% of DNA tumor samples, the AT allele
was lost compared with their DNA normal blood pairs. The AT allele was conserved 
in women with high parity. This was not the case in the group with low parity,
with 33.3% of patients showing loss of the AT allele in tumor DNA (P=0.041).
These results suggest that TP73 genetic alterations may contribute to the genesis
and/or progression of cervical carcinoma in an HPV-infected transformation zone
under prolonged exposure to events related to pregnancy.

Despite strong homology, the roles of TP53 and TP73 in tumorigenesis seem to be
fundamentally different. In contrast to TP53, tumor-associated overexpression of 
TP73 in many different cancers, combined with virtual absence of inactivating
mutations and lack of a cancer phenotype in the TP73 null mouse are inconsistent 
with a suppressor function but instead support an oncogenic function. The
discovery of NH(2)-terminally truncated p73 isoforms, collectively called
DeltaTAp73, is now the focus of intense interest because they act as potent
transdominant inihibitors of wild-type p53 and transactivation-competent TAp73.
Therefore, establishing deregulated DeltaTAp73 expression in tumors could be the 
crucial link to decipher which of the two opposing roles of this bipolar gene is 
the biologically relevant one. This study is the largest to date and encompasses 
100 ovarian carcinomas with complete expression profile of all NH(2)-terminal
isoforms, discriminating between TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 (DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73,
Ex2p73, and Ex2/3p73) by isoform-specific real-time reverse transcription-PCR. We
find that the set of NH(2)-terminal p73 isoforms distinguishes ovarian cancer
patients from healthy controls and thus is a molecular marker for this diagnosis.
Ovarian cancers strongly and almost universally overexpress DeltaN'p73 compared
with normal tissues (95% of cancers). About one-third of tumors also exhibit
concomitant up-regulation of the antagonistic TAp73, whereas only a small
subgroup of tumors overexpress DeltaNp73. Thus, deregulation of the
E2F1-responsive P1 promoter, rather than the alternate P2 promoter, is mainly
responsible for the production of transdominant p53/TAp73 antagonists in ovarian 
cancer. Tumor stage, grade, presence of metastases, p53 status, and residual
disease after resection are significant prognostic markers for overall and
recurrence-free survival. A trend is found for better overall survival in
patients with low expression of DeltaN'p73/DeltaNp73, compared with patients with
high expression. A strong correlation between deregulated DeltaTAp73 and p53
status exists. p53 wild-type cancers exhibit significantly higher deregulation of
DeltaN'p73, DeltaNp73, and Ex2/3p73 than p53 mutant cancers. This data strongly
supports the hypothesis that overexpression of transdominant p73 isoforms can
function as epigenetic inhibitors of p53 in vivo, thereby alleviating selection
pressure for p53 mutations in tumors.

PURPOSE: The p53 family member p73 displays significant homology to p53, but data
from primary tumors demonstrating increased expression levels of p73 in the
absence of any gene mutations argue against a classical tumor suppressor
function. A detailed analysis of the p73 protein in tumor tissues has revealed
expression of two classes of p73 isoforms. Whereas the proapoptotic, full-length,
transactivation-competent p73 protein (TA-p73) has a putative tumor suppressor
activity similar to p53, the antiapoptotic, NH(2)-terminally truncated,
transactivation-deficient p73 protein (DeltaTA-p73) has been shown to possess
oncogenic activity. The oncogenic proteins can be generated by the following two 
different mechanisms: (a) aberrant splicing (p73Deltaex2, p73Deltaex2/3,
DeltaN'-p73) and (b) alternative promoter usage of a second intronic promoter
(DeltaN-p73). The purpose of our study was to elucidate the origin of DeltaTA-p73
isoforms in hepatocellular carcinomas.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the underlying mechanisms of p73 overexpression 
in cancer cells by quantification of p73 transcripts from 10 hepatocellular
carcinoma patients using isoform-specific real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that only aberrantly spliced DeltaTA-p73
transcripts from the TA promoter show significantly increased expression levels
in the tumor whereas the DeltaN-p73 transcript generated from the second promoter
is not significantly up-regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we only analyzed 10 patient samples the results strongly
suggest that the elevated activity of the first promoter (TA promoter) accounts
for high-level expression of both full-length TA-p73 and aberrantly spliced
DeltaTA-p73 isoforms in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues.

Deletions at 1p are frequent in meningioma and represent a genetic marker
associated with the genesis of atypical WHO grade II forms. Previous mutational
analysis of TP73, a structurally and functionally TP53 homologous gene located at
1p36.33, failed to demonstrate a significant rate of sequence variations linked
to gene inactivation in meningiomas with 1p loss. As an alternative, TP73 may be 
inactivated through aberrant 5' CpG island methylation, a primary mechanism
participating in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes during tumorigenesis.
We determined the methylation status of the TP73 gene in a series of 60
meningiomas (33 grade I, 24 grade II, and 3 grade III samples), including tumors 
with deletion at 1p (n=30) and with intact 1p (n=30). Aberrant methylation was
detected in 10 cases (33%) with 1p deletion and in 3 tumors (10%) with retention 
of alleles at this chromosome arm. The distribution of the 13 cases of
methylation according to malignancy grade was 7 grade I, 5 grade II, and 1 grade 
III tumor. Accordingly, although TP73 aberrant methylation was more frequent in
meningiomas with 1p deletion (P<0.05), no association with the grade of
malignancy could be established. These findings, together with the previously
reported increased TP73 expression in malignant meningiomas suggest that opposing
functions of this gene may characterize distinct subsets of tumors: suppressed or
reduced expression as a result of CpG methylation in some grade I-grade II
tumors, and enhanced expression in some more malignant forms.

The TP73 gene encodes a nuclear protein that has high homology with TP53. TP73 is
rarely mutated in human cancer. The presence of a 1-kb regulatory fragment within
the first intron of TP73 was recently reported. This fragment exerts silencer
activity on TP73 mediated by ZEB. We searched for possible mutations in this
negative regulatory region in 45 colorectal and 43 breast cancer patients and in 
34 healthy donors. The study was carried out using the SSCP method, and the
allelic variants detected were sequenced. The expression of TP73 was analyzed by 
quantitative RT-PCR, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was assessed by
microsatellite study. In several samples, we identified an allele variant that
corresponds to a deletion of 73 bp in tumor tissues and normal counterparts,
localized between -489 and -417 from the ATG start site of exon 2. Among the 88
tumor samples, 35 (40%) showed at least 1 allele with the cited deletion, versus 
7 of the 34 (21%) healthy donors (P = 0.045). When we classified the patients
according to the number of variations into homozygous or heterozygous groups, the
significance was clearer (P = 0.03). No LOH was detected in the heterozygous
cases. There was a positive quantitative correlation between the expression of
TP73 and the presence of the allelic variant (P = 0.029). These data suggest that
this allelic variant is common in breast and colorectal cancers and that it could
alter the expression of the TP73 gene with an additive effect.

p73: in silico evidence for a putative third promoter region.

Sayan AE(1), Rossi M, Melino G, Knight RA.

(1)Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, Lancaster Road,
Leicester LE1 9HN, UK.

The TP73 gene, first identified in 1997, encodes the p73 protein, a p53 tumour
suppressor homologue. The lack of mutations in the TP73 gene in cancers and the
developmentally abnormal phenotype of the TP73 knockout mouse suggest a different
function for TP73 gene derived proteins. An alternative promoter in the third
intron of the TP73 gene, which produces a transcription deficient and dominant
negative protein (DeltaNp73), produces increased complexity in the function of
p73 proteins. Functional studies of transcriptionally active (TAp73; regulated by
the first promoter) and DeltaNp73 (regulated by the second promoter) show that
the TP73 gene encodes both a candidate tumour suppressor (TAp73) and an oncogene 
(DeltaNp73), with pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic properties, respectively. This
"two in one" gene architecture leads us to make an in silico search for other
probable promoter regions and transcription start sites in different introns of
the TP73 gene. To identify such regulatory regions, we have analysed the genomic 
structure of human and mouse TP73 genes. We have found introns 1 and 4 to be
extremely large and relatively conserved in size in mouse and human, in addition 
to intron 3, which includes the DeltaNp73 promoter. We have further characterized
these introns by transcription factor binding motifs, transcription initiation
sites, open reading frames, and splicing using six programs that can successfully
identify the already characterized promoters. Our results suggest the presence of
a candidate 2 kbp genomic DNA in the first intron of human TP73 gene, harbouring 
2 putative promoter regions, together with a similar region within intron 1 of
the mouse gene.

Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain
tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To
assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify
critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status of
11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a),
CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell
lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG methylation
was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the cerebellum. Extensive 
hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not
in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella). In 
contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours
(17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation
in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore indicate that extensive
methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in
medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell
lines was associated with their epigenetic transcriptional silencing and
methylation-dependent re-expression following treatment with the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied 
showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of
cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1), or
comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum (EDNRB), suggesting
that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in medulloblastoma. Our
data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation affects only a subset of
genes, and does not support the existence of a concordant methylation phenotype
in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant
feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially
critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the
normal cerebellum emphasises the requirement for appropriate control tissues when
assessing the tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.

Differential expression of p73alpha in normal ectocervical epithelium, cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Nenutil R(1), Ceskova P, Coates PJ, Nylander K, Vojtesek B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Faculty Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.

The TP73 gene is a member of the p53 family and through differential promoter
usage and alternative splicing can encode a number of different isoforms that
have distinct properties. p73 proteins are widely expressed in neural,
epithelial, and hemopoietic cells and are proposed to have roles in the
development and differentiation of various cell types and in tumorigenesis. The
authors have developed a novel monoclonal antibody that is specific for p73alpha 
to study the expression of this individual isoform in normal and neoplastic
cervical epithelium. In normal epithelium, p73alpha is restricted to
nonproliferating cells at the base of the epithelium, whereas other p73 isoforms 
are found in the proliferative zones higher up in the epithelium. In cervical
cancers, p73alpha expression is commonly lost, although other p73 isoforms are
present at high levels. In particular, the authors found that invasive islands
lose p73alpha expression when compared with the overlying intraepithelial lesion.
These results show a tight regulation of p73 isoform expression in cervical
epithelium and imply that different isoforms of p73 enhance or suppress
neoplastic cell growth. These data raise the possibility that reactivation of
p73alpha might be beneficial in cervical carcinoma. In addition, the absence of
p73alpha in cervical cancer represents a potentially useful tool for the
diagnosis of this disease.

deltaNp73 facilitates cell immortalization and cooperates with oncogenic Ras in
cellular transformation in vivo.

Petrenko O(1), Zaika A, Moll UM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, 
USA.

TP73, despite significant homology to TP53, is not a classic tumor suppressor
gene, since it exhibits upregulation of nonmutated products in human tumors and
lacks a tumor phenotype in p73-deficient mice. We recently reported that an
N-terminally truncated isoform, DeltaNp73, is upregulated in breast and
gynecological cancers. We further showed that DeltaNp73 is a potent transdominant
inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultured human tumor cells by efficiently
counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth
suppression functions (A. I. Zaika et al., J. Exp. Med. 6:765-780, 2002).
Although these data strongly suggest oncogenic properties of DeltaNp73, this can 
only be directly shown in primary cells. We report here that DeltaNp73 confers
resistance to spontaneous replicative senescence of primary mouse embryo
fibroblasts (MEFs) and immortalizes MEFs at a 1,000-fold-higher frequency than
occurs spontaneously. DeltaNp73 cooperates with cMyc and E1A in promoting primary
cell proliferation and colony formation and compromises p53-dependent MEF
apoptosis. Importantly, DeltaNp73 rescues Ras-induced senescence. Moreover,
DeltaNp73 cooperates with oncogenic Ras in transforming primary fibroblasts in
vitro and in inducing MEF-derived fibrosarcomas in vivo in nude mice. Wild-type
p53 is likely a major target of DeltaNp73 inhibition in primary fibroblasts since
deletion of p53 or its requisite upstream activator ARF abrogates the
growth-promoting effect of DeltaNp73. Taken together, DeltaNp73 behaves as an
oncogene that targets p53 that might explain why DeltaNp73 upregulation may be
selected for during tumorigenesis of human cancers.

BACKGROUND: The association between TP53/TP73 gene polymorphisms and tobacco
smoking was evaluated with regard to risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: A case-control study with 192 histologically confirmed NSCLC cases and
241 non-cancer controls was conducted. Subjects were genotyped for TP53 Arg72Pro 
and TP73 G4C14 to A4T14 polymorphisms by PCR-based methods. Risk and interactions
were assessed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: The analyses according to TP53 genotypes for the risk of tobacco smoking
illustrated that risk with heavy smoking was much higher for subjects with the
TP53 ProPro genotype (OR: 16.4, 95% CI 1.77-151.7) as compared with those with
TP53 ArgArg/ArgPro (3.36, 1.69-6.68). Similar analyses for TP73 genotypes did not
show any differences for NSCLC risk.
CONCLUSION: A risk relation of heavy smoking for the NSCLC is suggested with the 
TP53 but not the TP73 polymorphism.

Promoter hypermethylation represents a primary mechanism in the inactivation of
tumor suppressor genes during tumorigenesis. To determine the frequency and
timing of hypermethylation during carcinogenesis of nonastrocytic tumors, we
analyzed promoter methylation status of 10 tumor-associated genes in a series of 
41 oligodendrogliomas (22 World Health Organization [WHO] grade II; 13 WHO grade 
III; 6 WHO grade II-III oligoastrocytomas) and 7 WHO grade II-III ependymomas, as
well as 2 nonneoplastic brain samples, by a methylation-specific polymerase chain
reaction. Aberrant CpG island methylation was detected in 9 of 10 genes analyzed,
and all but one sample displayed anomalies in at least one gene. The frequencies 
of hypermethylation for the 10 genes were as follows, in oligodendrogliomas and
ependymomas, respectively: 80% and 28% for MGMT; 70% and 28% for GSTP1; 66% and
57% for DAPK; 44% and 28% for TP14(ARF); 39% and 0% for THBS1; 24% and 28% for
TIMP3; 24% and 14% for TP73; 22% and 0% for TP16(INK4A); 3% and 14% for RB1; and 
0% in both neoplasms for TP53. No methylation of these genes was detected in
normal brain tissue samples. We conclude that a high frequency of aberrant
methylation of the 5' CpG island of the MGMT, GSTP1, TP14(ARF), THBS1, TIMP3, and
TP73 genes is observed in nonastrocytic neoplasms. This aberration seems to occur
early in the carcinogenesis process (it is already present in the low-grade
forms), although in some instances (DAPK, THBS1, and TP73) it appears also
associated with the genesis of anaplastic forms.

Homozygous deletions scanning in tumor cell lines detects previously unsuspected

High rates of loss of heterozygosity commonly affect multiple chromosomes in
individual tumor types, yet the number of known tumor suppressor genes (TSGs)
systematically mutated in the corresponding tumors is usually low. The search for
homozygously deleted genome segments in tumor samples or cell lines has become a 
method of choice to identify major TSGs or to reveal their influence on the
development of a given tumor type. Here, we report a detailed homozygous deletion
(HD) profiling for 246 critical loci on a panel of 89 tumor cell lines containing
significant subsets of lung, ovarian and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. 
We found a total of 53 HDs affecting 17 loci. The major target for HDs was
p16-INK4A/p14-ARF (23/89, 26% of cases). Among the remaining alterations, HDs
affecting TP73 or telomeric markers have never been previously described, whereas
other HDs represent the first examples associating lesions of certain TSGs with a
given tumor type (NF2 in lung and ovarian cells, STK11 in HELA cells). Overall,
tumor cell lines established from ovarian or lung carcinomas displayed a
surprising diversity of loci targeted by HDs with 7 and 6 loci involved,
respectively. Our data suggest that, beside allelotyping or
transcriptome/proteome studies, extensive HD profiling represents a promising
approach for the detection of hitherto not implicated signalling pathways of
tumorigenesis.

The p73alpha protein is a functional homolog of the p53 tumor suppressor.
Although the TP53 gene is frequently mutated in human cancers, the TP73 gene is
rarely inactivated. We have found that p73alpha is highly expressed in a
significant fraction of anaplastic thyroid cancer, whereas it is not detectable
in normal thyroid epithelial cells or in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer 
cells. Interestingly, the tumor suppression function of p73alpha is actively
restrained in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. We have also found that c-Abl
tyrosine kinase, an activator of p73, is excluded from the nucleus of
p73alpha-positive thyroid cancer cells; whereas c-Abl undergoes
nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling in normal thyroid and p73-negative thyroid cancer
cells. We constructed an AblNuk-FK506-binding protein (FKBP) fusion protein to
enforce the nuclear accumulation of an inducible Abl kinase. Activation of this
nuclear AblNuk-FKBP by dimerization with AP20187 in anaplastic thyroid cancer
cells increased the levels of p73alpha and p21Cip1 and caused p73-dependent
apoptosis. These results suggest subcellular segregation of c-Abl from p73 to be 
a strategy for disrupting the tumor suppression function of p73alpha.

Differential gene methylation is observed in a variety of human malignancies. The
study of the pattern of methylated genes helps to understand carcinogenesis and
to identify potential marker tumor genes for clinical use. The differential
methylated genes in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) of Chinese
were studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Methylation
status of 11 tumor-associated genes (ARF, caspase-8, CDH1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MGMT, 
MLH1, RASSF1A, THBS1, TP73 and VHL) was studied in 30 primary undifferentiated
NPC and paired peripheral blood of 12 patients. The methylation profile of NPC in
order of frequency was CDH1 (50%), CDKN2B (50%), THBS1 (50%), RASSF1A (46%), MLH1
(40%), MGMT (28%), CDKN2A (23%), TP73 (20%), caspase-8 (7%), ARF (3%) and VHL
(0%). Methylation of at least 1 gene was observed in 93% of primary NPC. Of the
12 patients with at least 1 methylated gene in the primary tumor, all 12 (100%)
patients had at least 1 of the methylated gene promoter detectable in their
peripheral blood. The results show high frequency of methylation in NPC and the
potential of using methylation as peripheral blood tumor marker in screening NPC.

Aberrations of chromosomal bands 1p36 and 1q11-q23 are among the most common
chromosomal alterations in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In this study, 16 cases of
NHL showing recurrent unbalanced translocation t(1;1)(p36;q11-23) by G-band
analysis were selected for further analysis. To delineate the exact breakpoints, 
multicolor band analysis for chromosome 1 (M-BAND1), and locus-specific
fluorescence in situ hybridization (LS-FISH) using human genome designated BAC
clones were performed. In all but one dicentric case, the breakpoint was
determined to involve chromosomal bands 1p36.3 and 1q21.1-2. LS-FISH analysis for
the TP73, MEL1, SKI, and CASP9 loci at 1p36, and the loci IRTA1, IRTA2, BCL9,
AF1Q, JTB, and MUC1 at 1q21, verified the MBAND1 results and further delineated
the breakpoints. In band 1p36, two hybridization patterns were observed, one
involving deletions of MEL1, TP73, and SKI, but not CASP9, and the second
involving a breakpoint telomeric to TP73. In region 1q21, four hybridization
patterns were observed, the first involving duplication/translocation of all five
genes; the second involving duplication/translocation of BCL9, AF1Q, JTB, and
MUC1; the third involving duplication/translocation of AF1Q, JTB, and MUC1; and
the fourth with a breakpoint telomeric to MUC1. Using an alpha-satellite probe
for chromosome 1 (D1Z5), centromeric involvement in the unbalanced translocation 
t(1;1)(p36.3;q21.1-2) was excluded in all but the one dicentric case, that is,
dic(1;1)(p36.3;q10). In conclusion, deletion of 1p36 and duplication of 1q21
through formation of an unbalanced translocation t(1;1)(p36.3;q21.1-2) is a
non-random event in NHL, suggesting a deletion-duplication mechanism involved in 
lymphoma progression and justifying further systematic research.

TP53 family members and human cancers.

Based on gene sequence homologies, a p53 (TP53) gene family become apparent with 
the addition of the most recently identified p63 (TP73L; formerly TP63) and p73
(TP73) genes to the already known p53. The p53 gene encodes for a unique protein 
eliciting well-known tumor suppressor gene (TSG) properties that mediate cellular
response to DNA damage, e.g., cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In contrast, both
homologues specify an array of isoforms different in their N- and C-terminal
domains. Transactivating isoforms, such as TAp63/p73, show TSG properties similar
to p53, while isoforms lacking N-terminal transactivating domain such as
DeltaNp63/p73, induce a functional block against p53 as well as TAp63/p73
activities. Both p63/p73 types of isoforms are involved in development: p63 is
critical for epithelial stem cell renewal and epithelial homeostasis, and p73 is 
involved in neurogenesis and natural immune response. These facts support
interdependent functions for the p53 family members, which appear linked together
in a complex and tight regulation network to fulfill cellular functions related
to DNA damage and tissue homeostasis maintenance. The lack of p63/p73 mutations
in human cancers rule out a typical TSG role for either of the p53 homologues.
Nonetheless, p63 and p73 genes seem strongly involved in malignancy acquisition
and maintenance process because of: 1) their tissue identities, and 2) their
close interplay activities within the p53 family members, and primarily through
the negative regulatory role played by DeltaNp63/p73 isoforms for cell death
control and differentiation.

DeltaNp73, a dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73, is
up-regulated in human tumors.

p73 has significant homology to p53. However, tumor-associated up-regulation of
p73 and genetic data from human tumors and p73-deficient mice exclude a classical
Knudson-type tumor suppressor role. We report that the human TP73 gene generates 
an NH(2) terminally truncated isoform. DeltaNp73 derives from an alternative
promoter in intron 3 and lacks the transactivation domain of full-length TAp73.
DeltaNp73 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, but not in
normal tissues. DeltaNp73 acts as a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type
p53 and transactivation-competent TAp73. DeltaNp73 efficiently counteracts
transactivation function, apoptosis, and growth suppression mediated by wild-type
p53 and TAp73, and confers drug resistance to wild-type p53 harboring tumor
cells. Conversely, down-regulation of endogenous DeltaNp73 levels by antisense
methods alleviates its suppressive action and enhances p53- and TAp73-mediated
apoptosis. DeltaNp73 is complexed with wild-type p53, as demonstrated by
coimmunoprecipitation from cultured cells and primary tumors. Thus, DeltaNp73
mediates a novel inactivation mechanism of p53 and TAp73 via a dominant-negative 
family network. Deregulated expression of DeltaNp73 can bestow oncogenic activity
upon the TP73 gene by functionally inactivating the suppressor action of p53 and 
TAp73. This trait might be selected for in human cancers.

The recently discovered p53-family member p73 displays significant homology to
p53, but data from primary tumors and knockout mice argue against p73 being a
classical tumor suppressor. We report on the overexpression of NH(2)-terminally
truncated, transactivation-deficient p73 proteins (DeltaTA-p73) in human cancer
cells. Moreover, we show that DeltaTA-p73 overexpression results in malignant
transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and tumor growth in nude mice, thereby
providing the experimental evidence for an oncogenic function of DeltaTA-p73.
Apparently, increased expression of NH(2)-terminally truncated p73 isoforms
conveys the TP73 gene with oncogenic activity that appears to be actively
selected for during tumor development.

Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

The TP73 gene, located on chromosome 1p36.3, encodes a product that shares
significant structural homology with the tumor suppressor TP53. The aim of this
study was to investigate whether TP73 is involved in the development of
oligodendroglial tumors, which frequently carry deletions involving 1p36.3.
Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to
determine TP73 transcript levels. Ten of 24 (42%) tumors showed negligible to
more than 5-fold reduction in TP73 expression when compared to normal brain
level. To identify potential mechanisms that may modulate TP73 transcription in
oligodendroglial tumors, we performed mutation analysis on the TP73 gene. No
somatic mutations were however detected in the gene sequence. We then evaluated
the possible involvement of epigenetic change in TP73 expression. Bisulfite
genomic sequencing detected aberrant hypermethylation at the 5' region upstream
and including the first exon of the TP73 gene in 17 of 44 (39%) oligodendroglial 
tumors, whereas normal brain tissues showed no methylation in the same region
examined. Moreover, 6 of 10 (60%) tumors with negligible or decreased levels of
TP73 transcripts were methylation-positive. In conclusion, our results showed
that inactivation of TP73 occurs at the transcriptional level and is associated
with promotor hypermethylation. Loss of or reduced TP73 transcript expression may
contribute to the tumorigenesis of oligodendroglial tumors.

Role of p73 in malignancy: tumor suppressor or oncogene?

University of Essen, Medical School, Hufelandstr. 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.

The recently identified p53 family member, p73, shows substantial structural and 
functional homology with p53. However, despite the established role of p53 as a
proto-type tumor suppressor, a similar function of p73 in malignancy is
questionable. Overexpression of p73 can activate typical p53-responsive genes,
and activation of p73 has been implicated in apoptotic cell death induced by
aberrant cell proliferation and some forms of DNA-damage. These data together
with the localization of TP73 on chromosome 1p36, a region frequently deleted in 
a variety of human tumors, led to the hypothesis that p73 has tumor suppressor
activity just like p53. However, unlike p53-/- mice, p73 knockout mice do not
develop tumors. Extensive studies on primary tumor tissues have revealed
overexpression of wild-type p73 in the absence of p73 mutations instead,
suggesting that p73 may augment, rather than inhibit tumor development. In
contrast to p53, differential splicing of the TP73 gene locus gives rise to a
complex pattern of interacting p73 isoforms with antagonistic functions. In fact,
induction of apoptosis by increased levels of p73 can be blocked by both p53
mutants and the N-terminally truncated p73 isoforms, which were recently shown to
possess oncogenic potential. In the light of these new findings the contradictory
role of p73 in malignancy will be discussed.

p73 in apoptosis.

University of Essen, Medical School, Hufelandstr. 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.

The TP53 tumour-suppressor gene belongs to a family that includes the two
recently identified homologues TP63 and TP73. Overexpression of p73 can activate 
typical p53-responsive genes and induce apoptosis like p53. In addition,
activation of p73 has been implicated in apoptotic cell death induced by aberrant
cell proliferation and some forms of DNA-damage. These data together with the
localization of TP73 on chromosome 1p36, a region frequently deleted in a variety
of human cancers, led to the hypothesis that p73 has tumour suppressor activity
just like p53. However, despite its proapoptotic activity in vitro, the lack of
tumour-formation in p73 knock-out mice and primary human tumour data
demonstrating overexpression of wild-type p73 currently argue against p73 being a
classical tumour suppressor. Interestingly, in contrast to TP53, TP73 gives rise 
to a complex pattern of pro- and antiapoptotic p73 isoforms generated by
differential splicing and alternative promoter usage. Therefore further insight
into the function and regulation of these structurally and functionally diverse
p73 proteins is needed to elucidate the role of TP73 for apoptosis and human
tumorigenesis.

Therapeutic efficacy of E2F1 in pancreatic cancer correlates with TP73 induction.

Author information: 
(1)Centre for Cancer Research and Cancer Therapy, Institute of Molecular Biology,
University of Essen, Medical School, D-45122 Essen, Germany.

Pancreatic cancer is particularly resistant to apoptosis by antineoplastic
agents, which is partly attributable to the lack of functional p53. Here we show 
that E2F1 in combination with the most clinically efficient drug, gemcitabine,
resulted in a strong induction of apoptosis independent of functional p53,
whereas the effect of either therapy alone varied between different cell lines.
Intratumoral injection of a helper-dependent adenovirus vector expressing E2F1
plus drug treatment resulted in a significant reduction of tumor volume. The
therapeutic effect is directly correlated with the induction of the p53 homologue
p73, suggesting that the recently discovered E2F1/p73 pathway plays a critical
role in cancer therapy.

Gene alterations accumulate during the progression of acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML) to a malignant clone. Here, a new myeloid cell line, designated YSK-21,
with the balanced t(8;21)(q22;q22) and the unbalanced der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q21), was
established. YSK-21 grows well in a medium containing recombinant human
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). Molecular
analysis using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that t(8;21)(q22;q22) resulted
in an AML1-MTG8 fusion transcript. FISH and spectral karyotyping (SKY) in
conjunction with G-banding analysis revealed a der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q21) chromosomal
translocation, which appeared in the clone developed from the original leukemic
cells. Molecular analysis of the TP73 gene on 1p36 and the TP53 gene revealed a
deletion of one-allele in TP73 with partial demethylation of another allele in
the initial clone of YSK, and a point mutation consisting of an A-->T
substitution in codon 288 of the TP53 gene in the developed clone of YSK-21.
YSK-21 cells, expressing aberrant AML1-MTG8, TP53, and TP73 protein molecules,
may be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of these aberrant proteins and 
for studying the der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q21) chromosomal translocation.

Smallest region of overlapping deletion in 1p36 in human neuroblastoma: a 1 Mbp
cosmid and PAC contig.

Author information:

In human neuroblastomas, the distal portion of 1p is frequently deleted, as if
one or more tumor suppressor genes from this region were involved in
neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. Earlier studies had identified a smallest region of 
overlapping deletion (SRO) spanning approximately 23 cM between the most distally
retained D1S80 and by the proximally retained D1S244. In pursuit of generating a 
refined delineation of the minimally deleted region, we have analyzed 49
neuroblastomas of different stages for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from 1pter to
1p35 by employing 26 simple sequence length polymorphisms. Fifteen of the 49
tumors (31%) had LOH; homozygous deletion was not detected. Seven tumors had LOH 
at all informative loci analyzed, and eight tumors showed a terminal or an
interstitial allelic loss of 1p. One small terminal and one interstitial deletion
defined a new 1.7 cM SRO, approximately 1 Mbp in physical length, deleted in all 
tumors between the retained D1S2731 (distal) and D1S2666 (proximal). To determine
the genomic complexity of the deleted region shared among tumors, we assembled a 
physical map of the I Mbp SRO consisting predominantly of bacteriophage
P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones. A total of 55 sequence-tagged site
(STS) markers (23 published STSs and short tandem repeats and 32 newly identified
STSs from the insert ends of PACs and cosmids) were assembled in a contig,
resulting in a sequence-ready physical map with approximately one STS per 20 Kbp.
Twelve genes (41BB, CD30, DFFA, DJ1, DR3, FRAP, HKR3, MASP2, MTHFR, RIZ, TNR2,
TP73) previously mapped to 1p36 are localized outside this SRO. On the basis of
this study, they would be excluded as candidate genes for neuroblastoma
tumorigenesis. Ten expressed sequence tags were integrated in the contig, of
which five are located outside the SRO. The other five from within the SRO may
provide an entrance point for the cloning of candidate genes for neuroblastoma.

Different expression of P14ARF defines two groups of breast carcinomas in terms
of TP73 expression and TP53 mutational status.

In 95 breast carcinomas, we investigated P14ARF and TP73 mRNA expression and
their relationship to TP53 mutations, determined by an immunohistochemical
method, studying several clinicopathologic features of the tumors. P14ARF and
TP73 mRNA levels were determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using beta-actin as a control. P14ARF was
overexpressed in 19% of the cases and underexpressed in 24%. TP73 was
overexpressed in 22% of the tumors, and normal levels were found in the remaining
78%. The analysis of TP53 showed positive immunostaining in 38% of cases. The
association of P14ARF and TP73 overexpression was statistically significant, as
was the association between positive TP53 staining and TP73 overexpression.
P14ARF was related to TP53 only in those cases in which there was low expression 
of P14ARF. Concomitant overexpression of P14ARF and TP73 was statistically
related to positive TP53 immunostaining. The analysis of concomitant P14ARF and
TP73 overexpression and clinicopathologic parameters of the tumors showed a
statistically significant difference with respect to peritumoral vessel invasion 
(P = 0.01), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.03), negative ERBB2 expression (P =
0.005), and more advanced pathologic stages (P = 0.03). These results suggest
that overexpression of P14ARF and TP73 could be implicated in breast carcinoma
tumorigenesis and, ultimately, in the phenotypic features of these lesions.

Evaluation of 1p losses in primary carcinomas, local recurrences and peripheral
metastases from colorectal cancer patients.

Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas 
have shown that loss of the distal part of chromosome arm 1p is common,
particularly in tumors of the left colon. Because the importance of 1p loss in
colorectal cancer metastases is unknown, we compared the frequency, exact site
and extent of 1p deletions in primary carcinomas (n=28), local recurrences (n=19)
and metastases (n=33) from 67 colorectal cancer patients using 14 markers in an
allelic imbalance study. Loss of 1p was found in 50% of the primary carcinomas,
33% of the local recurrences, and 64% of the metastases, revealing a significant 
difference between the local recurrences and the metastases (P=.04). The smallest
region of 1p deletion overlap (SRO) defined separately for each group of lesions 
had the region between markers D1S2647 and D1S2644, at 1p35-36, in common. The
genes PLA2G2A (1p35.1-36) and TP73 (1p36.3) were shown to lie outside this
consistently lost region, suggesting that neither of them are targets for the 1p 
loss. In the second part of the study, microdissected primary carcinomas and
distant metastases from the same colorectal cancer patients (n=18) were analyzed,
and the same 1p genotype was found in the majority of patients (12/18, 67%). The 
finding that primary carcinoma cells with metastatic ability usually contain 1p
deletions, and that some cases lacking 1p alterations in the primary tumor
acquire such changes during growth of a metastatic lesion, supports the notion
that 1p loss may be important both early and late in colorectal carcinogenesis,
with the apparent exception of local recurrences.

Oncogenes induce and activate endogenous p73 protein.

Brook, New York 11794-8691, USA.

The identification of upstream pathways that signal to TP73 is crucial for
understanding the biological role of this gene. Since some evidence suggests that
TP73 might play a role in tumorigenesis, we asked whether oncogenes can induce
and activate endogenous TP73. Here, we show that endogenous p73 alpha and beta
proteins are up-regulated in p53-deficient tumor cells in response to
overexpressed E2F1, c-Myc, and E1A. E2F1, c-Myc, and E1A-mediated p73
up-regulation leads to activation of the p73 transcription function, as shown by 
p73-responsive reporter activity and by induction of known endogenous p73 target 
gene products such as p21 and HDM2. Importantly, E2F1-, c-Myc-, and E1A-mediated 
activation of endogenous p73 induces apoptosis in SaOs-2 cells. Conversely,
inactivation of p73 by a dominant negative p73 inhibitor (p73DD), but not by a
mutant p73DD, inhibits oncogene-induced apoptosis. These data show that oncogenes
can signal to TP73 in vivo. Moreover, in the absence of p53, oncogenes may enlist
p73 to induce apoptosis in tumor cells.

Role of the p53-homologue p73 in E2F1-induced apoptosis.

Comment in
    Nat Genet. 2000 Dec;26(4):391-2.

Most human cancers harbour aberrations of cell-cycle control, which result in
deregulated activity of the E2F transcription factors with concomitant enhanced
cell-cycle progression. Oncogenic signalling by E2F1 has recently been linked to 
stabilization and activation of the tumour suppressor p53 (refs 1,3,4). The p73
protein shares substantial sequence homology and functional similarity with p53
(refs 5-7 ). Hence, several previously considered p53-independent cellular
activities may be attributable to p73. Here we provide evidence that E2F1
directly activates transcription of TP73, leading to activation of p53-responsive
target genes and apoptosis. Disruption of p73 function by a tumour-derived p53
mutant reduced E2F1-mediated apoptosis. Thus, p73 activation by deregulated E2F1 
activity might constitute a p53-independent, anti-tumorigenic safeguard
mechanism.

The short arm of chromosome 1 is among the most frequently affected regions in
various types of common adult cancers as well as in neuroblastoma. In a previous 
study of ours, frequent allelic imbalance at the TP73 locus at 1p36 was noted in 
lung cancer despite the absence of TP73 mutations. This suggested the possible
existence of an as yet unidentified tumor suppressor gene on 1p. Our initial
attempt using the candidate gene approach did not yield any somatic mutations in 
the 14-3-3sigma gene (official gene symbol, SFN), a mediator of G2 arrest by
TP53. Detailed deletion mapping of the telomeric region of 1p was thus carried
out as an initial step toward positional cloning. We used seven polymorphic
markers in addition to TP73 to examine 61 primary lung cancers. Allelic imbalance
at one or more loci of 1p36 was observed in 30 of the 61 cases, whereas D1S508 at
1p36.2 exhibited the highest frequency (45%) of allelic imbalance among the 1p36 
markers examined. In contrast, two proximal markers at 1p32-34 showed
significantly less frequent (11-14%) allelic imbalance. Consequently, the present
study identified the shortest region of overlap between D1S507 and TP73, which
included the most frequently affected marker, D1S508. In addition, several cases 
exhibited allelic imbalance confined to a subtelomeric region distal to D1S2845
at 1p36.3. The present findings warrant future studies to identify the putative
tumor suppressor gene(s) at 1p36 to gain a better understanding of the molecular 
pathogenesis of lung cancer. Genes Chromosomes Cancer 28:342-346, 2000.

We have characterised the DFFB gene, encoding the active subunit of the apoptotic
nuclease DNA fragmentation factor (DFF40). DFFB maps to 1p36, near the imprinted 
putative tumour suppressor gene TP73. The DFFA gene (encoding the inhibitory
DFF45 subunit) also maps to 1p36.2-36.3, and we show by FISH that DFFB lies
distal to DFFA. We have also mapped a processed DFFB pseudogene to chromosome 9. 
DFFB itself has seven coding exons spanning 10 kb. Exhaustive mutation screening 
of 41 neuroblastomas and other tumours in which a 1p36 tumour suppressor gene is 
implicated showed no tumour-specific mutations. A coding region polymorphism was 
used to demonstrate uniformly biallelic expression in human fetal DFFB
transcripts. Since the putative neuroblastoma tumour suppressor gene in distal
1p36 is predicted to be maternally expressed, the lack of imprinting and absence 
of somatic mutations in DFFB indicate that it is probably not the neuroblastoma
tumour suppressor gene.

The tp73 gene, a tp53 homologue, has been sub-regionally mapped at 1p36.3, a
chromosomal region frequently deleted in neuroblastoma. Due to its chromosomal
localization and to the mono-allelic expression observed in some neuroblastoma
cell lines, it was proposed that tp73 might be involved in the pathogenesis of
neuroblastoma. Functional assays have demonstrated that tp73 can inhibit cell
proliferation and induce apoptosis. The role of this gene in tumorigenesis,
however, is still unclear. We analyzed tp73 expression in 95 sporadic
neuroblastoma samples by RT-PCR and we detected the tp73 transcript in 46 cases
(48.4%), without significant correlation with age, clinical stage or 3-year
overall survival. A genetic polymorphism in the 2nd exon of tp73 was utilized to 
identify the transcribed allele in tumor-cell samples. Expression from only one
of the tp73 alleles was found in 13 out of 16 heterozygous tumors, while in 3
samples both alleles were present. Genotype analysis of 73 patients and 150
controls showed a significant deviation (p = 0.0308) from the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium for a tp73 allele only among neuroblastoma patients. The absence of
correlation between tp73 expression and clinical stage, age and survival suggests
that this gene does not play an essential function in the clinical course of the 
disease. However, the distribution of genomic tp73 alleles in patients indicates 
that a role of this gene in the development of neuroblastoma cannot be completely
ruled out. Int. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol.) 84:365-369, 1999.

In the present study we establish a FISH fine-map of 1p36.3 loci. This region is 
frequently altered in different types of human tumors suggesting the existence of
cancer-related genes. Identification of cosmids carrying both D1S468 and TP73
sequences leads to the assignment of TP73 to the most frequently deleted locus in
colon and breast cancer and integrates this gene in human genetic maps.
Localization of other distal loci was determined as follows:
distal-CDC2L1-D1Z2-D1S94-TP73/D1S468-D1 S1615-proximal. D1S1615, earlier reported
as a telomeric sequence, is considerably more proximal than previously thought.

We report the refined chromosomal localization of the putative tumor suppressor
gene TP73 (alias p73) within the genomic region between the anonymous loci D1Z2
and D1S47. The region measures less than 6 Mb and covers a genetic distance of 16
cM. The present mapping considerably restricts the previous cytogenetic
localization of TP73.
